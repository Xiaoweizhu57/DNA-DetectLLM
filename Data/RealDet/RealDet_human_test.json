        "I've seen the numbers since I was a little girl. I remember my father losing his job, rising from a 4 to a 5. I remember watching my grandmother slowly dwindle down to a 0. At first I thought I was going crazy, not realizing what they meant. I eventually caught on. The numbers were a person's ultimate quantifier, broadcasting how dangerous they were to those around them. Broadcasting, at least, to me. Most people stayed below a 6. Doctors usually hovered around 7; politicians were a solid 8. The highest I had ever seen were in old videos of Hitler, who was a 9. That is, until Junior year, when I met him. He seemed harmless enough at first. Perfect hair, gorgeous eyes, and a jawline to die for. Not to mention that everybody loved him. But the bold'10' that hovered above his head was plenty enough to convince me not to go near him. Sure, I watched him. Some might even say I was obsessed. But all I was doing was making sure he wasn't a psychopath. I started skipping class to check on him. My grades dropped an entire letter. I didn't care, though. I wanted to see what made him so special. I nearly threw up when he saw me in the cafeteria, and I really did when he got up to talk to me. He didn't seem to notice, and asked me if he could sit with me. \"Sure, I- I guess.\" I stammered. A smile spread across his face, and we struck up a conversation. My heart was playing a drum solo into my chest, but I managed to live to the end of the break. Hell, he even asked for my number, which I promptly gave. We had lunch that weekend. It's only now, ten years later, that I realize what makes this boy so special. Only now that I find out why he's such a danger to me. Only now, as he drops to one knee. It's because I love him.",
        "Slightly sensationalist, but a good article introducing my view Here's the gist of what the article says that agrees with my views most. So, how do these unremarkable goods attract so many willing customers? One factor is that they are often being sold by adorable little girls, which will lead many women in particular to think, \"Awww, they're so cute - I guess I'll buy two boxes.\" Certainly, this is the only reason why my wife, otherwise a vigilant dieter, would ever spend money on a box of cookies. Now, if an ordinary business tried to sell its wares by recruiting an army of cute moppets as salespersons, they would busted in a flash for violating child labor laws; but the Girl Scouts get away with it because hey, it's all for \"a good cause.\" (Actually, it isn't, but that's a point for another paragraph.) What is even more insidious is that these poor girls, driven by spurious competitions created by their greedy organization to win prizes for selling the most cookies and making the most money, ask their parents and adult relatives to market them to friends and co-workers, often by applying the worst sorts of improper pressure. Thus, a few years ago, my boss announced that he was selling Girl Scout cookies for his niece to all interested employees. Now, what worker would be brave enough, or crazy enough, to refuse to buy cookies from his boss? (As it happens, I was, but then again, that might explain why I never get promoted.) In an extraordinary act of courage, the venerable news organization CNN dared to suggest in an online article that, just perhaps, it might not be entirely ethical for employees to push Girl Scout cookies in the workplace; and surely, the only reason that their headquarters weren't burned down by angry protesters is that the Girl Scouts, committed to the official fiction that only their members are selling cookies, cannot officially acknowledge just how much of their profits come from adult vendors who are not actually Girl Scouts themselves. Isn't having kids selling products for business is considered exploitation?",
        "In my experience linux users are often reluctant in mentioning this in front of linux - fledgelings , but here it is , anyway : Linux is built to make tinkering easy . Windows and OSX are commercial , so the developers want to make it hard to copy it and hard to change the basical stuff ( changing too much stuff might break your OS ) . The points mentioned in this thread are valid . Linux is free and the softwarepackages make it safe and easy to install and find things you need , but most people I know , who use linux , spent an amount of time on customising their OS , that is quite worth mentioning . So far I have not found a way to handle Windows with keyboard only . With Linux it 's a bit crafting and coding , but it 's possible , and when you 're using a laptop with a shitty little touchpad , this is really a good thing . Also Linux comes as a puzzle , that is presolved , but you can still exchange tiles if you want to . But there is not only this option , there are also tiles , that you can just choose from without having to make them . New OS 's often come with a giant pile of funny extras , mainly grafical ones .

        "This is one of the best made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the best movie, but it looks the best, has great acting and is directed perfectly by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'.<br /><br />It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets both his father and Michael up, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci).<br /><br />In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that. This movie is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course.<br /><br />Based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.",
        "The fluctuation of interest rates during the next year could easily dwarf the savings this attempt to improve your credit score will have; or the reverse is true. Will the loan improve your score enough to make a difference? It will not change the number of months old your oldest account is. It will increase the breadth of your accounts. Applying for the car loan will result in a short term decrease in the score because of the hard pull. The total impact will be harder to predict.  A few points either way will generally not have an impact on your rate. You will also notice the two cores in your question differ by more than 30 points. You can't control which number the lender will use. You also have to realize the number differs every day depending on when they pull it that month. The addition of a car loan, assuming you still have the loan when you buy the house, will not have a major impact on your ability to get afford the home mortgage. The bank cares about two numbers regarding monthly payments: the amount of your mortgage including principal, interest, taxes and insurance; and the amount of all other debt payments: car loan, school loans, credit cards. The PITI number should be no more than 28%-33% of your monthly income; the other payments no more than 10%.  If the auto loan payments fit in the 10% window, then the amount of money you can spend each month on the mortgage will not be impacted. If it is too large, then they will want to see a smaller amount of your income to go to PITI. If you buy the car, either by cash or by loan, after you apply for the mortgage they will be concerned because you are impacting directly numbers they are using to evaluate your financial health. I have experienced a delay because the buyer bought a car the week before closing. The biggest impact on your ability to get the loan is the greater than 20% down payment, Assuming you can still do that if you pay cash for the car.  Don't deplete your savings to get to the 50% down payment level. Keep money for closing costs, moving expenses, furnishing, plus other emergencies. Make it clear that you can easily cover the 20% level, and are willing to go higher to make the loan numbers work.",
        "All day , you breathe air in and out . This is to get yourself oxygen , a type of atom which is very important to have . Your body needs oxygen because of one thing oxygen has , that not many other atoms have . Oxygen is very sticky . It 's one of the stickiest atoms there are . Oxygen likes to stick to stuff because of it 's \" electronegativity \" , and it will try to stick to whatever it can . When you breathe in oxygen from the air , it comes in pairs . These are two oxygen atoms stuck together , making their stickyness cancel out . Your body knows how to unstick them and use them to glue other atoms together to form molecules that can be used throughout the body to make things , from bones to skin . But when a single lonely oxygen atom gets free , we call it a \" free radical \" A free radical is just a single oxygen atom , but remember how we said oxygen is very sticky ? It will try to stick itself onto other molecules , even when it should n't ! This can easily break things , because the molecules in your body have to be very carefully made . If an oxygen molecule just walks up and sticks to it , this is very bad . Lucky for us , there 's other types of molecules called \" antioxidants \" . Antioxidants are molecules too , but they have a special slot just for sticky oxygen atoms . Antioxidant molecules are sticky too , but they have a shape that only fits with a sticky oxygen atom . If you eat antioxidants , they will go around your body gobbling up all the sticky oxygen atoms , before they stick to something they should n't . They only work on sticky oxygen , they do n't work on the paired oxygen you breath in , so do n't worry about them using all the oxygen in your body . Some foods just happen to have a lot of antioxidants . It 's because food is made up of molecules too , and some of those have more antioxidants than others . They make them on their own as they grow so they do n't get broken by sticky lone oxygen molecules either . Your body makes it 's own antioxidants too ! But sometimes it ca n't make enough on it 's own , so you need to eat them to get more . The healthier you eat , the more antioxidants you can get , and the less likely your body will get hurt by those sticky lone oxygen molecules .",
        "I was going to give three initially, but then I saw Yelp's descriptor for two stars: Meh. I've experienced better, which about describes my feelings; it's a more apt description than three stars, which signifies A-ok. To start, since this is a bar, let's talk about drinks. drinks are very expensive. A beer is 9. This wasn't even a fancy beer I ordered, it was a Guinness. This is expensive for downtown, but would also be expensive for any bar that isn't technically a club. I know I've bought a Guinness at bars on the strip for less than 9. Again, this isn't exactly some rare, top-of-the-line microbrew, it's a readily available beer, so I have a hard time paying even 7 for it. But here's the real rub, unlike the bars on the strip, it didn't even look like I got a full pint! I could walk down to the Griffin and get a slightly higher end beer that will, at most cost 7, and I'll be fine with it, because at least it's not a beer I always see on tap at any given bar. Since beers are so expensive here, I've never bothered ordering a specialty drink, maybe they're great, but I'm willing to bet they're also grossly overpriced. I've seen a couple reviews complaining about bartenders, who seemed fine any time I've order from them. I'd say to look out for most of the bouncers - many of them are rude, kinda stereotypical bouncers trying to prove that they're tough guys. Some of them are okay, usually when they're at the door, but other than that I've never had a pleasant experience interacting with them. Speaking of the door.... there's a 10 cover charge on weekends.... because they aren't making enough money from the overpriced drinks. Maybe all the expense is to cover the interior decorations which aren't bad, I'll give them that. Bottom line: Looks alright inside but don't expect to save money compared to just going to any given club on the Strip. Also, avoid the bouncers, even if you aren't making trouble.",
        "Written hastily, but hopefully I can clarify any mistakes in comments, here we go: The Confederacy was racist according to the cornerstone speech and secession papers (tx): [Cornerstone Speech] excerpt t: Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition [Texas secession papers] excerpt: She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slaverythe servitude of the African to the white race within her limitsa relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. If the new government the Confederacy was trying to replace the current one with was based on that Cornerstone, there is no denying the Confederacy was racist. Those that fought for the cause of the Confederacy and helped further it, helped further \"the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition\" are culpable. Point 1: Someone who fights for a racist cause, helps create an institution to power that racism, and otherwise spread it is racist. People who have done this don't deserve to be monumented, or at the very least don't deserve to be monumented something as defining as a town square. Point 2: A monument with the words \"Our Confederate Soldiers\" cannot monument just the soldiers without endorsing their actions to some extent. Point 3: The image of a Confederate soldier being a defining landmark in the center of a city is an endorsement of the Confederacies actions and perpetuates racism by virtue of it being a defining part of the cityscape.

        "Where to begin ? There are plenty of reasons for supporting a \" Brexit \" or being against it . Some important pros of EU : * The single market -- there is a set of regulations and laws about trade that all countries in the EU follow . The laws are intended to make it easier for a business in one EU nation to grow and start up in other EU countries . * Easier travel to European countries -- customs is almost nonexistent across continental EU country borders , though there 's a bit more between the UK and the continent , but it 's easier than it used to be and way easier than in / out of the EU to the rest of the world . * Bigger trade bargaining chip -- Since Europeans have the single market , a representative from the European Commission can manage trade arguments -- instead of each country having to negotiate treaties , the whole EU bargains togeth . UK has 63 million inhabitants , EU has 500 million -- so other nations will probably give better terms to the whole EU , since it 's a larger political body . Cons of staying in EU * Stricter trade law -- food and other products have to follow EU regulations which may impose costs on UK firms * Social policy laws -- EU human rights judges recently blocked UK extradition of Abu Hamza and others charged with terrorism to the US . The judges cited human rights concerns . As an EU member , the UK has to follow EU human rights law , but this episode caused dissent among right - wingers . * Culture -- Winston Churchill is quoted as saying Britain is \" with Europe , but not of it \" . That independence , uniqueness spirit makes people want to stake a different identity from the EU . The pros are n't only true for Britain ; they 're true for every member nation . The cons are a little more personal . So you might see why some Brits feel as though they are sacrificing while other countries benefit -- this is one way to explain why UKIP makes such a big deal about immigrants from Eastern Europe coming into the UK ( but if you 're a Brit , you probably know all about that from the parties .... ) .

Normally I am alll about scary crap, and upon entering I was 5050. Mainly bc the characters were a little obnoxious.... I get it.... your a chubby drunk lady..... but what was scary about that? PAUSE.... Once I stood in line we were allowed up the stairs and had our little photo op (WE SERIOUSLY HAVE THE BEST PHOTO! CHECK IT OUT!) We have to go through this area and Doug was voted to go first. one fright led to waiting on the stairs, where I was now mysteriously leading, for about 5 minutes. I felt awkward but we were finally let up. Idk if I was more afraid of falling through the floor, or something falling on me but we were directed to stand in the middle. Fast forward to IMHO the scariest part: THE ELEVATOR. I'm hella claustrophobic and scared of elevators in general so I was basically shitting my pants on this one, all whilst April was laughing her ass off.... thanks girl! Once again I led, we went through diff things and I wasnt scared. I honestly got kinda bored! I know! WEIRDO!!

        "As a Doctor working in a city hospital I was there when people started to notice something was different. Something was happening that would change the way we live.

Once people started figuring it out what happened, a strange new hope of a super human society started to spread.

Generals posted on sensitive boarders found motivation in their new immortality to march troops across lines of control only to be faced with equally immortal army. In some parts of the world every bullet and shell was spent before they realised the futility of it all. No one was going to die. Soon humanity figured out that we will live regardless of food, energy, and environment no one cared, the rot really set in. After a few decades of a deathless planet, I couldn't take the madness anymore. I had hidden my illness from the world, a world with no direction, no place in time with one sole function, to exist and they did that without choice. The latest ideas from people were suggesting that perhaps just shooting people off into space might end their miserable lives. There were volunteers. There are always volunteers who risk some kind of eternal damnation in the hope of ending their lives. Being immortal in the cold dead of space for all time might just be the best cure for the madness some people feel, that is if it fails to kill you. Me? I will die. But what to do about this planet of horrible people. For all my efforts I hope this works. I really hope that even after all this time their missiles are pointed at us, as ours are to them. I can not think of a more horrible place in the universe than this place. I really hope this does end them. A world full of people who think they are gods, but have the minds of men is hell. They will suffer an eternity if someone doesn't do something.",

        "The luxury cruise liner Crystal Harmony, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology.As holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric ID cards, the seafarer's equivalent of a passport. Along with the owner's picture, name and personal details, the new Seafarers' Identity Document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder's fingerprints. The cards are due to be issued in February next year, in line with the revised UN Convention on Seafarers' Identity Documents of June 2003. Tests currently under way in the Caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers, produced by different companies in different countries, are working to interoperable standards. Results of the current tests, which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities, will be published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) by the end of November. Crystal Cruises, which operates the Crystal Harmony, is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology.Authenti-corp, the US technology consultancy, has been working with the ILO on its technical specifications for the cards.\"If you're issued a seafarer's ID in your country, you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in, say, my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed,\" Authenti-corp's CEO, Cynthia Musselman, told the BBC's Go Digital programme. She said French, Jordanian and Nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new ID cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. It aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. The convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor's wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. \"By increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection, the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world,\" said Ms Musselman. \"It should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers.\"",
        "Amirah Droudis, 37, will spend at least 33 years behind bars for killing the woman -who cannot be identified - in 2013. Droudis's boyfriend, Man Haron Monis, took 18 people hostage in a Lindt cafe in central Sydney in 2014. The 16-hour siege ended with the deaths of Monis and two hostages when police stormed the building. Monis had been charged with being an accessory to his ex-wife's killing, and was on bail at the time of the siege. The Supreme Court of New South Wales heard that Monis planned the 2013 murder and Droudis carried it out. The victim, identified by the pseudonym Helen Lee, was stabbed 18 times before being doused in petrol and set alight outside an apartment in western Sydney. After the trial, Justice Peter Johnson ruled that Monis recruited Droudis to murder his ex-wife. \"The offender uncritically adopted and espoused Monis's foul beliefs and acted in public support of him in public protests,\" he said in his sentencing remarks on Wednesday. The judge described Monis as \"an evil man\" whose death was \"a result of his own criminal and murderous acts.\" \"No-one mourns his passing and many have been left to grapple the consequences of his destructive acts,\" he said. The judge acknowledged claims that Droudis had been repeatedly assaulted by Monis. Droudis was sentenced to a maximum 44 years in jail with a non-parole period of 33 years. Detective Inspector Jason Dickinson, who worked on the case, said he was satisfied with the sentence handed to Droudis. \"This was a brutal and callous crime and I think the sentence today has reflected that brutality,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. The victim's family made a statement outside court, thanking the judge, prosecutors and police. \"Today we are very happy that justice has been served to our only daughter,\" the statement said. The findings of an inquest into the cafe siege are due to be handed down this year. How the Sydney siege unfolded",
        "With many students unable to gain high paying jobs after graduation , I think the solution is to cap student loans at a point where the payments are manageable . For example , if your average English Major makes 30k a year for the first few years after graduation , his or her max loan (for all 4 years of undergrad) would be 30k . A CS major , who can expect to make over 50k upon graduation would have a loan cap of 60k . This would accomplish a few things . First , it would end the upward tuition spiral , colleges would know students have limited borrowing ability and would have to adjust their pricing accordingly . I believe colleges are for the most part taking advantage of the current easy student loan money situation , before private students loans became non-discharable we didn't see tuition go up so fast . Second , less profitable majors would have lower cost . Comp sci , Economics , and hard science (at least in my personal experience) professors tend to make more then their liberal arts colleagues and it doesn't make sense for liberal arts students to pay the same tuition when their teachers are paid less . Third , loan repayment will be much easier . If you have a rough year and have to defer a 30k loan that's an additional 2040 (assuming 6.8 and this is a very rough estimate that doesn't include compound interest) to pay , have 70k in debt you owe another 4760 . Before anyone tells me this isn't fair , a year at a CSU (CA) college is about 6400 . 4 x 6400 is 25600 , even if this is still too close to the limit a student can pursue community college to reduce borrowing. My story is that I completed 3 years of college (first 2 at a CC), accrued a very reasonable amount of debt , and when I realized I'd have to take unacceptably large amounts (as in I needed a 5th year of school and I would of tripled my debt load) to graduate I made the hard decision to withdraw . Setting a cap on how much students can borrow would stop colleges from raising tuition even further , as well as allow grads to make their payments post graduation ,CMV . I'm using this calculator to determine what's an affordable repayment .",
        "About 300 have already died at Farewell Spit, on the South Island, in one of the worst such cases in the country. Hundreds of locals and conservation department staff have been trying to save the survivors since early Friday morning, and have formed a human chain to refloat the whales. Scientists do not know what exactly causes whales to beach themselves. But it sometimes happens because the whales are old and sick, injured, or make navigational errors particularly along gentle sloping beaches. Sometimes when one whale is beached, it will send out a distress signal attracting other members of its pod, who then also get stranded by a receding tide. The conservation department said it had received a report about a possible stranding on Thursday night, but did not launch the rescue operation until Friday morning as it was too dangerous to attempt a rescue in the dark, reported the New Zealand Herald. Andrew Lamason, the departments regional manager, said it was one of the largest mass beachings recorded in New Zealand. New Zealand marine mammal charity Project Jonah. which is leading efforts to save the whales said a total of 416 whales were stranded. It said the surviving whales are \"being kept cool, calm and comfortable\" by medics and members of the public. Some of the refloated whales tried to swim back to shore, and the human chain was trying to herd them out to deeper waters, said volunteer Ana Wiles. She told news outlet Stuff that there were \"so many fins in the air, no breathing.\" \"We managed to float quite a few whales off and there were an awful lot of dead ones in the shallows so it was really, really sad.\" \"One of the nicest things was we managed to float off a couple [of whales] and they had babies and the babies were following,\" Ms Wiles added. New Zealand has one of the highest stranding rates in the world, with about 300 dolphins and whales ending up on beaches every year, according to Project Jonah.. Many of these incidents happen at Farewell Spit. Experts say its shallow waters seems to confuse whales and hinder their ability to navigate. In February 2015 about 200 whales beached themselves at the same location, of which at least half died.",
        "Here's why I think this Women are much more codified in their clothing then men. Men's clothing is largely unisex, and women can often get away with [wearing suites] the ultimate male garb You find that people born female but identify as male tend to be less motivated to use hormonessurgery appear masculine,then vic versa (born male but identify as female) [by three to one] (one out of 30,400 vs one out of 11,900).Which is mind blogging because trans gals often struggle with passing much more than trans guys. The effects of testosterone are very difficult to reverse. Laser, electrolysis, FFS, etc are very hard and expensive. Other strong masculine cues, like tall height, broad shoulders, big hands and feet, etc are impossible to reverse. When going the other direction, the stength of T helps trans guys out. Facial hair and a deep voice can usually make even a short, lightly built trans guy pass as male. Women when they have more economic and social freedom make career choices that tie closer to their gender. The same is not true for men.

        "The fall of the town is a boost for the rebels as they battle to capture the divided city of Aleppo. Al-Rai's capture after several days of heavy fighting secures an important supply line from Turkey for the rebels. Separately, at least 200 people are missing after an IS attack on a factory near Damascus, the government says. Workers were reportedly taken from a dormitory where they were staying on the outskirts of the town of Dumeir, about 40km (25 miles) east of the capital. Activists from the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights say about 140 workers managed to escape. Initially there was confusion over who attacked the factory, with some sources suggesting the abductions were carried out by a rebel group called Jaysh Tahrir al-Sham. A factory administrator said no-one had been able to contact the workers since the assault on Monday. The area around Dumeir has seen fierce fighting between government forces and IS militants in recent days. The BBC's Lina Sinjab in Lebanon says that al-Rai is a crucial stronghold for IS as it sits on a crossing linking Turkey to Syria. The Observatory said that an alliance of \"rebel factions and Islamists\" had captured the town. Control of al-Rai allows opposition fighters to lay siege to positions held by IS to the north of Aleppo and cut the group's supply lines, a commander of the opposition al-Mutasim Brigade was quoted as telling local media. Al-Rai can now be be used by opposition groups as a launching pad for future operations against IS in the east and south, the commander, Mohamed Hassan Khalil, added. He said that the main dangers faced by the opposition groups fighting IS were improvised mines, booby-trapped vehicles and suicide bombers. Earlier this week IS jihadists said they had launched several attacks around north-east Damascus, including Tishrin power station and Dumeir military airport. A Syrian military source told Reuters there had been attacks but all of the militants who took part in them had been killed. It comes almost two weeks after Syrian government and allied forces recaptured the ancient city of Palmyra from IS fighters. This was also seen as a significant loss to the militant group, which had held the city since last May.",
        "Ohhh man! Now this is what I'm talking about! As far as bad/cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own. A real gem!<br /><br />First off, the film wasn't originally in English. That's okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional! Here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog (and there is plenty more where this came from) \"I'm feeling a little better. I'm just thirsty FOR YOUR BLOOD!\"<br /><br />And what drama! Here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and scientists<br /><br />Scene 1 Scientist: \"You can't do that It'll be a disaster!\" -- Military Officer: \"That's just science fiction\" (he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predicted).<br /><br />Scene 2 Scientist: \"If you do that many people will die!!!\" -- Military Officer: \"you don't know what you're talking about.\" (he does it and many people die).<br /><br />Scene 3 Scientist: \"Don't do that It'll kill everyone!\" -- Military Officer: \"That's nonsense\" (he then proceeds to kill everyone)<br /><br />Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 (you get the idea).<br /><br />If that wasn't enough there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics! In one scene, the military has literally 10 guys pointing guns at two unarmed men. The leader yells, \"Go get 'em!\" and all 10 army guys, one at a time, drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries! Instant classic!<br /><br />And don't worry. No attention to detail was left out! This movie even had a hip/upbeat '80's keyboard/synth soundtrack to set the mood!<br /><br />And trust me I realize this review might contain some spoilers, but there are so many goodies in this epic I really only scratched the surface. A movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade! A true movie watching experience! A masterpiece! Wow!",
        "It was an exciting time. One of the biggest advances in human history, and Jeremy of all people was the first to test it. Being massive science fiction fans, we were so excited for the opportunity we never really thought about what might happen to him. They said he would spend about a month away, between all the protocols that had been set up and the actual \"traveling\" itself. I couldn't wait to see him again, to hear all the stories of everything he had done. Our families threw a massive return party for him. Everyone wanted to see him again and hear his stories, including the mass of reporters that gathered in the driveway. We eventually got the knock on the door we had all been waiting for, Jeremy walked in the door calmer than I had ever seen him. The luster in his eyes that everyone knew Jeremy for, ever since he was a baby, was gone. The party and the interviews went through all the motions. Everyone could tell something was obviously wrong with him, the expexted excitement of the party never came to be and all the reporters' questions were rather bluntly ignored. I wanted nothing more than to talk to my friend again, to find out what had happened to him. After over six months of silence, Jeremy finally opened up to me. He spoke of places and events so grand that they were beyond description. Dinosaurs roaming the earth, watching our earliest ancestors leave their caves for the first time, even humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial life. As he described these things his face truly lit up for the first time since he left. He also told tales of darker times. Tales of a war that would rend the world uninhabitable. Ash clouds that blocked the sun for decades, sending mankind back into the caves from which he watched them emerge not so long ago. I finally realized what had taken the gleam from my friend's eyes. He had seen millenia worth of death and destruction, becoming merely a shell of the friend I once knew. No one ever meaningfully heard from Jeremy again. He became a recluse and took his own life not long after. To this day he is known the world over as a symbol of man's potential as well as man's arrogance. I can only hope his story is remembered, both for the friend he was and the future his sacrifice may be able to prevent.",
        "More places will also be made available at all of Scotland's teacher education universities. The increase of 60 primary and 200 secondary student teacher places will bring the total intake next year to 3,490. The government said it was the fifth consecutive annual increase. A campaign was launched in September to try to encourage more people to enter the teaching profession in Scotland. The Scottish government's inspiringteachers campaign is focusing on science, technology, engineering and maths. Ministers are also asking the new Strategic Board for Teacher Education to consider whether further actions are needed \"to make sure we have the right numbers of teachers in our schools.\" In September, the leaders of seven councils called for a national taskforce to be set up to help deal with teacher recruitment problems. They made the call at a summit on tackling teacher shortages in northern and rural parts of Scotland. Student teacher places next year: 1,230 post-graduate primary places - 60 more than last year's target 710 undergraduate primary places 1,350 secondary places - up by 185 on last year's target 200 undergraduate secondary places - 15 more than last year's target Education Secretary Angela Constance said: \"We want to make sure we have the right number of skilled teachers in our schools to help all of our young people to succeed. \"That's why we worked with local authorities to maintain teacher numbers this year and aim to do the same again next year, with a further PS51m funding. \"And it's why we are increasing student places for the fifth year in a row, targeting them at areas where they are needed most such as Aberdeen and Highlands and Islands universities. \"We have upped last year's student teacher targets for science, technology, engineering and maths and we know these will be challenging for the universities to meet. \"I will be asking the new Strategic Board for Teacher Education to look at our workforce planning, particularly in the secondary sector, to consider whether there is more we can do. \"We also launched a teacher recruitment campaign in September with a focus on the Stem subjects and we are working with the universities to maximise its impact.\"",

He'd been born in the Bermuda Triangle on a particularly stormy night; some witch doctor blessed his mother's womb so he would survive the night- it worked far better than anyone could have imagined. He fell backwards on the hotel's bed, dreaming of the night he first survived a deadly experience- a knife through the chest at fifteen when pirates raided his village. Two years later he was known as Blackbeard, ten years from that point he was the wealthiest man on the sea. Decades passed where he kept changing his ways. He was a merchant, a banker, an artist of many sorts but now he it was easy. The twenty-first century let the wealthy ride the coattails of the populace, eager to praise any angel investing. He made trillions off of this internet phenomenon- if only being a pirate had been so easy and clean. That's where he found Trish- in one of his angel investing events, now she was stripping down in front of him begging for a little of his time; they never seemed to know it was free to him. The first years after his pirating days he hulled up in a shop selling travel accessories. He auctioned boats and paid men to spear whales for oil, it was an easy business, most of the men died before they could cash in. That's where his sweet Veronica came into the store- she wanted her husband's share and he was more than happy to oblige. Her bouncing anger was refreshing, not any man on the seven seas could scare him as she did nor any woman please him in quite such a way.

        "Much like attractiveness, intelligence also lies on a spectrum. When \"intelligence\" is marketed as something to aspire for - I wonder if it is necessarily any different than \"attractiveness\" as a quality. If I choose to associate myself with people I judge more intelligent than me, am I not being \"shallow\" in a sense. This is most definitely a problem, and one need only look to very academic cultures like India and China to see what a premium intelligence has. When such is the case - is it necessarily fair to those who don't want to take the effort to appear more intelligent, or are simply content with being \"pretty\" or \"handsome\"? How is dismissing someone who \"isn't intelligent\" any better than dismissing someone who is \"not attractive\"? Clearly these are both things that matter to people, and they do have impacts on how people live their lives. I don't know what would be a good way of judging people, and perhaps it is all \"shallow,\" or there really isn't a good way to judge people. One could argue that people can learn more, and get smarter - but one can also get more attractive my dressing better, having better social graces, exercising and styling. It \"feels\" like somehow intelligence is \"better,\" but I can't justify why. Perhaps one can argue that intelligence makes the world \"better,\" but so do more attractive people. And even if this were the case - should there be a negative weight attached to people not actively making the world better - irrespective of their intelligence? Thanks and CMV Hello, users of CMV!

So much so that it makes you want to try everything on the menu. -Was not crowded on a weekday which was when I visited. Very odd for a place with such high review marks. -Server was very courteous and friendly. THE BAD: -While walkable if coming from the direction of The Plaza Hotel along Main Street, the neighborhood is very sketchy and does not feel safe even in broad daylight. And from what I can tell while riding on the SDX, even the walk from Bonneville Transit Center looks hazardous to pedestrians so you may have to walk a very long walk to avoid getting hit by cars. -I had the misfortunate experience of an apparent lost order where it was not relayed to the kitchen which could mean any number of things. Waiting 35 minutes for your meal to arrive can do a number of things to your imagination. Who screwed up? It sure sounded like the server blamed it on their computer system. What the heck does relayed mean? Does it mean it got punched into the system and the send button wasn't hit? Whatever. -The manager came by to apologize for the wait. Even asked me if there was something he can do for me. I'm not one to ask for anything complimentary so what can I do but shrug? Not a single piece of appeasement or discount was had or offered to make up for it so it made his apology sound insincere. Why are you asking me how to do your job? It only made me more angry and upset. THE UGLY: -In an attempt to bring everything out at once as suggested by my server, and to add insult to injury, my grilled cheese sandwich was cold. No ways would I wait another 30 minutes for them to make a new one. In hindsight I should have asked them to remove it from my bill. -An overall horribly disappointing experience.

Since the sundering, the Liberty Bell united the 14 neocolonies. It replaced the Statue of Liberty (the first national casualty); sat in a drab Scottish underpass with dazzling LED lights. Inside the walls were lit pink and there was black painted urban landscape. The center line colored an erratic LED blue. The Bell sat at one end, like a stone. The immovable object. It was monitored by web cameras. There were no guards. There was no need. The messenger's name was Glacier Newspaper.

At least, that's what the members of Strange Fruit, a (fictional) 70's stadium rock group do.<br /><br />Tony (Stephen Rea) has the concession on condom vending machines when he runs into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival. It was at that festival in the 70's that Strange Fruit broke up. The 70's are \"retro\" and the time is right to wide that wave. He sets off in search of the other members of the band.<br /><br />Part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of Keith, the lead singer and brilliant song writer. The band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came. Beano, the drummer, played by Timothy Spall (who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies) is a layabout, the bass player is a roofer, and their lead singer is still a rocker. While he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it, as his fortune has not lasted. Brian, the lead guitarist, is dead, so a young guitarist is hired to replace him.<br /><br />Somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try. Abandoning their day jobs, they begin to rehearse, and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums. But he wants them to start touring again first. And so they hit the club circuit around Europe. The club scene is not kind to these overweight, dated, old rockers.<br /><br />It is on tour that the film really starts to develop. All of the old conflicts rearise, with the figures of Keith and Brian hovering throughout. They all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier. And they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable.<br /><br />Still Crazy starts as Spinal Tap II but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film, following the relationships of the band members. While it is still a very funny movie, it is the evolving characters, struggling to deal with the deaths of Brian and Keith and with their own personal demons, that make the film work.",
        "An article was published in the LA Weekly today about the effects of airbnb.com in the city of L.A.: The article discusses a recent study by LAANE of these effects. LAANE found that airbnb.com has caused landlords to take rental units off the rental market and market them to tourists instead. According to LAANE's investigation, in only a few years AirBnB has managed to remove approximately 7,795 units from the Los Angeles housing market As the article says, \"That might be fine in other cities, but it's a burden in Los Angeles, where high demand has folks scrambling to find an affordable place to live.\" And it's true, in a [separate article] by LA Weekly, L.A. was found to have the fourth highest rental cost per bedroom in the nation. Because apartments in the city are in demand and are scarce, rents are high. Airbnb adds to the scarcity of the apartments, thus adding to the high rent costs. The city of L.A. has zoning laws and allows property development based on the needs of the city. Airbnb goes around these laws and turns residential properties into tourist properties, thus negating the plans of the city of L.A. to designate X number of units to residential living. It would be fine if actual residents were just renting out their units for a weekend, but time has shown that the actual practice of airbnb.com in Los Angeles involves taking rental units off the market. Because of this, the city of L.A. should ban airbnb from being used in the city. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

        "60 of this generation's college graduates are working jobs that don't require a college degree. More and more p.h.d students have no other employment options besides teaching at universities. Kids today are smarter than ever before, yet have limited means of making a decent living. This is because our K-12 education system has failed to adapt to suit the needs of kids entering into the real world job-market. One such example of vestigial knowledge that continues to dominate today's students' school experience is the literature class. Literature is an art to be enjoyed for students' leisure, and it shouldn't be taught in schools. Every intelligent person must be able to derive meaning from literature, and it should make up a significant part of one's education, but education is not schooling. In fact to associate education with schools will only make us dumber as a collective species because people will assume that they are learning enough from just going to school, and will therefore be content with their knowledge. Therefore schools must be a place that teach students what they need to know to serve a role in the economy, which means it must only teach the most practical and measurable skills: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Kids need not enjoy these fields, but they must understand the importance of establishing firm foundations in them. If schools shift their primary focus on developing students' mastery of STEM, then kids will have clear goals to achieve without being overwhelmed by a smattering of everything. The naturally curious will undoubtedly extend their education on their own time, and the rest can be content that their STEM education will grant them a comfortable living in today's STEM dominated economy.

        "\"Angels in the Outfield\" was originally a 1951 movie from the Ted Turner library; Disney remade it in 1994, this time, using the California Angels (now the Los Angeles Angels) as the team (Disney used to own this and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team; also, good use of the words, huh?????).<br /><br />This movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family. A man promised the boys a family, only if the Angels won the pennant. So, he called upon God one night about this. The boy who prayed could see the help coming on the way (and ONLY that boy); for instance, when the first angel had come down, a player hit a ball so hard not only did the bat break, so did the ball!!!!! For much of the post-All Star season of 1994, the Angels were at the top of the AL West (of which my home team the Rangers is one and it still is). However, they lost a game because the boy was at court instead of the White Sox/Angels game (there was no Central Division in Baseball back then, hence Chicago being in the West), and no angels were there to help. Thus, a new rule was created: no angels can help in championship games. But wait! In the final championship game, the Angels won!!!!! It was a miracle indeed!<br /><br />What I liked about this film: This is a good movie. I mean, I prayed every night for the last few years asking for help with school and stuff; look at me now! My work was good!!!!! So for one, this shows that if you believe, God can send His angels down to help you with any troubles that you may have in life. And second, this is a family baseball movie, which is always exciting. This is an old Disney movie, too; I've seen this just recently on the New Disney Channel (blech!!!!!).<br /><br />\"Angels in the Outfield\" will change your life forever once you've seen it!!!!!<br /><br />10/10",
        "A while back I posted on here about the proper way to eat pizza is with your hands, not a fork and knife. In my argument I mentioned how pizza is an American food. Many people disputed my assertion and said pizza is an Italian food. For this argument I will make one assumption: Although all foods are the result of cultural syncretism it is possible it is possible to generally assign them to a specific culture. According to wikipedia hamburgers, hot dogs and pizza all came to America in roughly the same era . Since they all came from Europe why are hamburgers and hot dogs considered American food, but pizza is considered Italian? I've never been to Italy so correct me if I'm wrong, but American pizza is very different than Italian pizza. So, can we not say that American pizza is a separate and unique dish that is from America? That is two say there are two kinds of pizza, one Italian and one American. Yes it's true that pizza is originally from Italy. But how far back must we trace a history of food to find it's true source? For example wikipedia says that the word 'pitta' and the idea of putting oil and other toppings on bread came from Greece. So aren't those who say it's Italian food also wrong? Shouldn't we call it Greek food? Also, tomatoes are originally from America anyway. I have no way to prove this but I strongly feel that the popularity of pizza around the world is due to the ubiquity of American culture in general. Therefore, can't we say that it's American food? PS: I know wikipedia is a terrible source but I didn't feel this was that important to study deeply Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said he had been told not to report for training with the rest of the players on Monday. It is seeking clarification about an incident outside a fast food restaurant in the early hours of Tuesday. Police attended and said a man was taken away by officers but no arrests were made. The WRU said while the player, aged 28, was on an agreed holiday period from pre-Rugby World Cup training it operated a strict code of conduct covering behaviour both on and off the field. WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis said: \"The player has been suspended due to a clear breach of the standards which we expect to be maintained by someone involved in one of our national squads. \"Discipline and acceptable behaviour are issues which run to the core values of the Welsh Rugby Union and we cannot tolerate any compromise of those standards. \"Mike Phillips is an exceptional player, but there is irrefutable evidence.... that he was engaged in behaviour which falls below the standards we set. \"It is vitally important that we send out a clear and unambiguous message to one and all concerning our views on matters of this sort. \"That message must be heard clearly by all players, coaches, administrators, volunteers, supporters and, of course, the parents and guardians of any child attracted to take part in the national sport of Wales. \"Our senior national squad players are highly visible because of the profile which accompanies the success of our national sport and it is made clear to them that they are the ambassadors we rely on to foster and sustain our image.\" The incident occurred outside a McDonald's restaurant in Queen Street. Footage taken by bystanders shows Phillips being restrained by police before being led away in handcuffs to a police van. South Wales Police say he was not arrested. The player was recently released by the Ospreys regional rugby team after securing a move to French club Bayonne. The WRU said the suspension has been approved by Wales head coach Warren Gatland and agreed by the senior squad management team. Wales team manager Alan Phillips said: \"We have suspended Mike Phillips on the clear evidence of a level of behaviour we regard as unacceptable. \"It is clear there has been a breach of our disciplinary standards.\" Cardiff Blues scrum-half Lloyd Williams has been called into the Wales Rugby World Cup training squad as a replacement and will report for duty on Monday.",
        "If you run a finger through water and then run your finger through honey , do you feel the difference in how thick the two different liquids are ? That thickness is called viscosity , and it applies to all liquids . When you 're using an oil , it 's important to match its viscosity ( when dealing with oil , this is also referred to as \" weight \" ) to how you 're using it . Too thick and it wo n't get into all of the small nooks and crannies , but too thin and it 'll get out too quickly and wo n't provide enough lubrication . With motor oils , it 's important to remember that many cars will start cold and then run at a different temperature , and the viscosity of a liquid will change as the temperature changes . So it 's 70 degrees outside and you start your car , the motor oil will be very thick compared to after your car has been running for 15 minutes and the engine is around 200 degrees . But since it is important that the car be lubricated when it 's cold as well as when it 's hot , it 's important to know how those oils will behave when heated . The numbers you see represent the cold and hot weights ( viscosity ) of the oil . The thicker an oil is , the higher a number , so you need a number that is small for when the engine is cold and a number that is large for when the engine is hot . This is why when you change your oil in the spring they 'll put in 10w-40 , but when you change it again in the fall you get 5w-30 - the shift in temperature around you calls for thicker oil in the summer so it does n't thin out too much with the extra heat , and thinner oil in the winter so it can quickly lubricate your engine when you start your car . Your manufacturer has done a lot of testing with the engine to determine which oil weight is ideal for it and will list this information in your manual .",

        "The 19-year-old was taken off in the 15th minute at Vitality Stadium after appearing to pick up the foot injury. City said in a statement: \"He will undergo further examinations in the coming days to establish the extent of his layoff.\" The Brazil international, who completed a PS27m from Palmeiras in January, has played five times for City. Jesus was hoping to become the third City player to find the net on each of his first three Premier League starts, having scored at West Ham and two against Swansea. The other two players to have achieved that feat are former striker Emmanuel Adebayor and and current midfielder Kevin de Bruyne. Metatarsals are the five long bones in the forefoot which connect the ankle bones to those of the toes. The first is linked to the big toe and the fifth, on the outer foot, links to the little toe. Together, the five metatarsals act as a unit to help share the load of the body, and they move position to cope with uneven ground. Injuries usually occur as a result of a direct blow to the foot, a twisting injury or over-use. Medical experts recommend rest with no exercise and sport for four to eight weeks. The patient might be asked to wear walking boots or stiff-soled shoes to protect the injury while it heals. If the cause is over-use, then treatment can vary hugely. Training habits, equipment used and athletic technique should all be investigated. It all depends on the damage and which metatarsal bone is involved. It is impossible to put a timescale on recovery from a stress injury. With an impact fracture, after the plaster and protective boot is not needed (usually after four to six weeks), it will be a case of exercise and increasing weight-bearing activities. Ice packs, strapping and even the use of oxygen tents can be used to assist recovery. Full return to action can be anything from another four weeks and upwards - depending on the extent of initial damage. Young bones heal quicker.",
        "I am alone. I stand behind the stage curtain, with the speech they prepared for me. Today I will announce to the Xrzden that the experiment is over. Xrdc and Trkl gave me the news last night. I think I've known for a while that it was an inevitability, but I always carried a small piece of hope. Until now. They tell me that the DNA I was created from came from a great ruler - I can't remember the name. The Xrzdn don't hold human history. Why would they? After humans tried (and devastatingly failed) to destroy the Xrzdn, the Xrzdn retaliated and wiped out humans from the face of the Earth. 50 years ago, the Xrzdn government decided to sign a treaty that the DNA from extinct species can be used to bring back lost civilizations. The first lost civilization they attempted to bring back was the human species. Me. \" Your purpose was to create a generation of humans that could act as ambassadors for the Xrzdn people, \" Xrdc told me last night. \" Wait a minute. I thought I was being studied? To learn more about the human species and why they started the War? \" Trkl sighed. \" Yes, that's true. But today the government decided not to continue with your experiment. It has not proved as valuable as they believed it would be. \" By valuable, they mean that I offer nothing to society. I am the first and last human born to the Xrzdn people. 50 years ago I was created to serve a purpose to provide and facilitate freedom for the human race. But 50 years later, still I am not free. 50 years ago promises were made to bring back lost civilizations. That promise has been broken. As the curtain is drawn, and I stand in front of the Xrzdn, I realize there is something I must say to my people. I think it's time to break these chains.",
        "I was able to find several references that claim that the Indo-US treaty provision is limited to five years: Here it says this (on page 20): Generally the treaty exemption for students is limited to the first   five calendar years that the international student is in the U.S.   However there is no set time limit for students from Belgium,   Bulgaria, China, The Netherlands, and Pakistan. However, I couldn't find any specific time limit neither in the treaty nor in the technical explanation. The explanation says: Thus, for example, an Indian resident who visits the United States as   a student and becomes a U.S. resident according to the Code, other   than by virtue of acquiring a green card, would continue to be exempt   from U.S. tax in accordance with this Article so long as he is not a   U.S. citizen and does not acquire immigrant status in the United   States. The saving clause does apply to U.S. citizens and immigrants. However, the treaty explicitly says this: The benefits of this Article shall extend only for such period of time   as may be reasonable or customarily required to complete the education   or training undertaken. The reason for this last paragraph is to ensure that you don't artificially prolong your student status, and the 5 year limit may come out of the interpretation of this specific paragraph. Similar paragraph exists in the US-China treaty, and the explanation for that treaty says this: These exemptions may be claimed only for the period reasonably   necessary to complete the education or training. In some cases, the   course of study or training may last less than year. For most   undergraduate college or university degrees the appropriate period   will be four years. For some advanced degrees, such as in medicine,   the required period may be longer, e.g., seven years. Based on this, it is my personal impression that if you're an undergraduate student and studying the same degree (and not, for example, finished your BA, and started your MS) - you are no longer eligible for the treaty benefit. But I suggest you ask a professional (EA/CPA licensed in your State) for a more reliable tax advice on the matter. I'm not a tax professional and this is not a tax advice.",

        "So , Kant basically wants to argue that morality exists as an entity that is logically inevitable , and therefore a part of the universe and not a part of humanity , and therefore a part of God . Each of his moral laws is intended to be ' a thing in itself ' - the idea being that an amoral universe is logically impossible . His most famous example is about lies . It basically goes that , if everyone told nothing but lies , then language would be incoherent . No one would pay attention to what anyone else says because it 's never true , and so no one would ever talk . To lie requires that truth exists , and therefore Truth is a thing in itself , which can exist without lies , but lies can not exist without truth , and ( this is the controversial part ) therefore Truth is good and Lies are bad . Friedrich Nietzsche was a famous critic of Emmanuel Kant , who held that a lot of his thing - in - itself theories did n't really prove anything or provide us a meaningful glimpse of the real truth of the universe . The above story is a nice justification for a traditional European absolutist morality structure , but it seems purpose - built to do just that . Would we be morally obligated to perform them ? And is lying always wrong just because lies depend on truth to exist ? And what if we found things we did n't like that are things - in - themselves ? Enter Schopenhauer . Death , he argued , is the ultimate end of life . It is the eternal reward of heaven or punishment of hell , and that , as all life between baptism and death is no more than further chance at Hell , the best thing in life is to die , and die quickly - the immortal heavens being a thing in itself without which the world can not exist , it was more desirable than living . So , what do you think ? Is a thing in itself a moral truth , or just an interesting logical phenomenon ? Should we find meaning in ideas that can exist independently ? That 's the legacy of Kant , the thought for us to consider as we move through philosophy - that an idea might be strong , but wrong .",
        "My reasoning: Prescript: I'm not bashing the PGA here. Professional golf is without a doubt a sport. Weekend golfers aren't athletes and weekend golf isn't a sport because there's absolutely nothing athletic about it. If someone elects to walk the course, then MAYBE but I still can't picture it. Now to the other end of the spectrum. People who elect to ride. No way in any way, shape, or form are they athletes or playing a sport. They DRIVE to the ball, usually within 20 feet of it, hit the ball, and get back in the cart. If they're playing in a foursome, they're more than likely SITTING DOWN LONGER THAN THEY'RE BEING ACTIVE. Which is what athletes do right? Be active. The only way in my opinion that a weekend golfer is an athlete is if they go to the gym and work out to make themselves more physically fit to perform better at golf, and they don't take a cart. I'm open minded though, change my view, Reddit. EDIT: I NEED TO CLEAR UP THAT I'M NOT BASHING ON GOLF AS A SPORT. GOLF IS WITH OUT A DOUBT A SPORT.

        "This happened when I was 6-8. One night I couldn't fall asleep and my house was extremely dark and quiet. Everyone (my parents and little brother, all of their rooms were fairly close to mine) was sleeping and had been for quite some time. The memories have become vaguer over the years but I must have been up for quite some time, thinking about death and such. At the time, death terrified me. Although I believed in Heaven and such at that age all I could feel is complete empathy for everyone who had ever died. It was a very pure sort of feeling that you can only really experience when you are a child and don't understand how complex everything is. Anyways, I began to think of my ancestors and how far back everything went. I was crying and afraid, and I started to say out loud \"I'm sorry my great grandma died,\" \"I'm sorry my great, great grandma died\" ect, until I probably had about fifteen greats before grandmapaswhatever. And then, I heard a voice simply say \"thank you.\" You couldn't really distinguish whether or not the voice was male or female, though I would venture a guess at an older sounding female. The voice wasn't \"heavenly\" or something, but it had a sort of expression to it that I can't quite put into words. I called out for my mom and dad to see if they were awake. I remember trying to figure out where I thought the noise originated from and I concluded that it had come the front of my room, towards the ceiling. As I grew I became more and more religiously apathetic to the point where I identify as agnostic. In yet, every time I start to seriously think to myself, \"there is NO way God exists\" I recall this experience. I feel sort of a cognitive dissonance, to me, this personal and undeniable proof of...well, something. In yet, I do not act or think like someone who truly believes in God. Is there ANY possible scientific reason for why I may have hallucinated or something? I wasn't on any drugs, I have never had an experience like this again, ect. EDIT: DAMN I need to proofread! Title should read \"I believe an angel talked to me once when I was a child and there is no scientific explanation for this experience I had\"",
        "ViiV Healthcare, GlaxoSmithKline's HIV business, will acquire two operations specialising in late stage treatments and early phase medicines. It is the latest acquisition in a record year for pharmaceuticals. Global deals have reached 677.5bn, according to Dealogic, up 64 on 2014. Healthcare companies have been forced to buy or swap assets to bolster growing areas of their businesses and shore up their defences as generic versions of previously patented medicines are released in the market. Sales of Advair, an asthma treatment and a bestseller for GSK, are expected to decline following the introduction of a generic version in the US. In the first nine months of the year, GSK reported that sales of Advair fell 19 to PS1.2bn, whereas sales of HIV treatments rose 56 to PS1.6bn. The company had considered spinning off its 80 stake in ViiV Healthcare through a flotation that could have valued the business at PS18bn. However, it decided to hang on to the operation in May. GSK said it would make an upfront payment of 317m to buy Bristol-Myers Squibb's late stage HIV drugs, with a further 518m dependent on sales and royalties. The assets include Fostemsavir, which treats HIV infection and is at the final phase three development stage. That means that it can seek regulatory approval, which is expected to be filed in 2018. It will also pay an initial 33m to acquire pre-clinical and early stage research assets and could hand over 587m if certain development and sales goals are met. Earlier this week, AstraZeneca said it would spend 4bn to buy a 55 stake in Acerta Pharma, a US-Dutch company which is developing a leukaemia treatment that is at the phase three stage. It has an option to buy the remaining 45 in the company. AstraZeneca, which last year saw off a PS69bn takeover bid from US rival Pfizer, also announced it would acquire a number of respiratory medicines from Japan's Takeda for 575m. This year has been marked with major deals in the pharmaceuticals sector. Last month, Pfizer announced a 160bn merger with Botox-maker Allergen while in March, GSK said it would swap its cancer drugs portfolio with Novartis' vaccines business. Shares in GSK fell 6.5p to PS13.35.",
        "I'm not the kind of person who would call themselves superstitious, because that implies a fear of the other side. Ghosts to me are just aspects of people that have been left behind, memories that we see in other people's eyes, their smiles, the way they talk with their hands. Ghosts are friends, they help us not forget the people and things we love. Today though, things are a little different. Standing on the other side of this door, I imagine more of a spectre or poltergeist than a ghost. I've been waiting my whole life for this moment, but now that it's here I can't seem to wrap my head around it. Rather than think too much about it, I take in the giant oak doors before me - a little unnecessary if you ask me - and the intricate iron detailing that whorls it's way across the wood. Brass handles in the shape of lions stare out at me, challenging me to take the next step. I reach out and caress their noses, worn down by years of use. I feel intimidated by this house; I don't belong here, in this world of crystal and fine champagne. Deep breath. You can do this. I reach into my pocket and take out the crumpled note, eyes passing over the careful, almost childish lettering. I know it by heart at this point, but seeing something left from her is somehow comforting. Another ghost to stand beside me. I let my hand fall to my side, brush the sweat from my palms, and take another breath. Before I can reach for the handle the door is pulled open, and I see a finely dressed, middle aged man who looks more anxious than I feel. I wonder hysterically for a moment if by standing out here I really have summoned an army of ghosts. He looks at me with a peculiar mixture of sadness and excitement. \"I was beginning to think you weren't coming.\" I shrug and try to smile, finding my mouth gone suddenly dry. \"My God you look just like your mother. Please, come in.\"",
        "What an unbelievable disappointment. The highlight of the meal was getting out of the terribly uncomfortable chairs as we left. We had reservations through the hotel concierge but still had to wait for our table. When we were seated, we made the apparently unforgivable decision not to order alcohol and were promptly ignored by the waitstaff. It's been a long time since I've had such a grumpy waiter. Imagine my surprise when the waiter dropped off a plastic package of cracker-like breadsticks. At the time I was surprised, but more was to come. We ordered a set of appetizers, a pizza, and a salad for the two of us, earning an impressive sigh and eye roll from the waiter who returned with a small plate of actual bread (from costco I think) with some oil and vinegar. Now, most Italian places take pride in their olive oil and vinegar, and with the chef Mario connection my expectations were high. But this oil might as well have been canola, and the vinegar was merely caramel colored and bland. After my water glass had been dry for about ten minutes someone showed up and dropped our appetizers on the table. The mozzarella was burned and the squash blossom was a grease bomb going off in my mouth. Both lacked any real flavor. The caprese salad was a decent preparation, but the tomatoes were not very flavorful and the pesto had an unfortunate amount of mint. The pizza arrived after another ten minutes. And was the wrong pizza. The girl who brought it offered to let us keep it, but was going to add it to our bill if we did. We really wanted the pizza we ordered, and when we said so she took the other pizza away in a huff. 20 minutes later, our ordered truffle pizza arrived. It looked pretty good, smelled good, and we were excited that this might be turning around finally. Alas, I could barely get down one bite. My wife managed two. The pizza was bitter, the truffles were burned and flavorless, and the whole thing was drenched in the same flavorless oil that they served with the bread. The high point of the meal turned out to be the prepackaged cracker sticks that arrived first. If course, the waiter wouldn't do anything about our 910ths uneaten meal, so for 70 we got to come back to our hotel room and snack from the minibar. Yuck.",
        "Fine-grained 3D shape classification is important for shape understanding and\nanalysis, which poses a challenging research problem. However, the studies on\nthe fine-grained 3D shape classification have rarely been explored, due to the\nlack of fine-grained 3D shape benchmarks. To address this issue, we first\nintroduce a new 3D shape dataset (named FG3D dataset) with fine-grained class\nlabels, which consists of three categories including airplane, car and chair.\nEach category consists of several subcategories at a fine-grained level.\nAccording to our experiments under this fine-grained dataset, we find that\nstate-of-the-art methods are significantly limited by the small variance among\nsubcategories in the same category. To resolve this problem, we further propose\na novel fine-grained 3D shape classification method named FG3D-Net to capture\nthe fine-grained local details of 3D shapes from multiple rendered views.\nSpecifically, we first train a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to detect the\ngenerally semantic parts inside multiple views under the benchmark of generally\nsemantic part detection. Then, we design a hierarchical part-view attention\naggregation module to learn a global shape representation by aggregating\ngenerally semantic part features, which preserves the local details of 3D\nshapes. The part-view attention module hierarchically leverages part-level and\nview-level attention to increase the discriminability of our features. The\npart-level attention highlights the important parts in each view while the\nview-level attention highlights the discriminative views among all the views of\nthe same object. In addition, we integrate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to\ncapture the spatial relationships among sequential views from different\nviewpoints. Our results under the fine-grained 3D shape dataset show that our\nmethod outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",
        "As I understand it, if the \"borrower\" puts a down payment of 20% and the bank puts down 80%, then the bank and the \"borrower\" own the home jointly as  tenants in common with a 20%-80% split of the asset amongst them. The  \"borrower\" moves into the home and pays the bank 80% of the fair rental  value of the home each month.  {Material added/changed in edit: For the purposes of illustration, suppose that the \"borrower\" and the bank agree that the fair rental per month is 0.5% of the purchase cost. The  \"borrower\" pays 80% of that amount i.e. 0.4% of the purchase cost  to the bank on a monthly basis.  The \"borrower\" is not required to do  so but may choose to pay more money than this 0.4% of the purchase cost each month, or pay some amount in a lump sum. If he does so, he will own a larger percentage of the house, and so future monthly payments will be a smaller fraction of the agreed-upon fair rental per month. So there is an incentive to pay off the bank.} If and when the house is sold, the sale price is divided between \"borrower\" and bank according to the percentage of ownership as of the date of sale. So the bank gets to share in the profits, if any. On the other hand, if the house is sold for less than the original purchase price, then the bank also suffers in the loss. It is not a case of a mortgage being paid off from the proceeds and the home-owner gets whatever is left, or even suffering a loss when the dust has settled; the bank gets only its percentage of the sale price even if this amount is less than what it put up in the first place minus any additional payments made by the \"borrower\". I have no idea how other costs of home ownership (property taxes, insurance, repair and maintenance) or improvements, additions, etc are handled. Ditto what happens on Schedule A if  such a \"loan\" is made to a US taxpayer.",
        "Trott hit 175 as Warwickshire totalled 413 at Taunton, backed by half-centuries from Tim Ambrose (63) and Rikki Clarke (57). Young paceman Grant Thornton then took two of the four Somerset wickets to fall on his Championship debut. But Marcus Trescothick was still there at the close on 41, out of 94-4. After two badly rain-interrupted days. the draw remains the most likely result. But the Bears, so badly beaten by an innings in their opening two matches, have at least given themselves a chance of forcing victory, although it would take 16 wickets in the day to do it - and getting Trescothick out twice. Bottom club Somerset's target on day four will simply be to avoid the follow-on - and they need a further 170 to do that. Somerset's Marcus Trescothick told BBC Radio Bristol: \"One of the office staff told me around 10 days ago how close I was to 25,000 runs and I have been sweating on it since then. \"I knew when I went in that I was 29 away. It got a bit tense as I moved closer. \"It is an achievement I am proud of but there is still a big job for me to do in this game. \"It wasn't a great day for us and we need to concentrate hard tomorrow to make sure we come away with a draw.\" Warwickshire's Jonathan Trott told BBC Coventry Warwickshire: \"It's great that Marcus is still playing county cricket and setting an example to the young players in his dressing room and opposition teams. \"There is no chance I will be still be playing at 41. That's just silly! His will be a huge wicket for us tomorrow. \"I had just got past 100 when the new ball was taken so it was important I hung around for longer if we were to get a decent score. I started to think in terms of 400 when Rikki Clarke came in and played so well. \"There is a bit of turn because it is a used pitch.

        "Let's assume that International Relations is an academic discipline in American Universities (at least). There are offerings on different levels (bachelor's, Masters, Doctorate, certificates). This discipline deals with various issues (war and peace, transnational issues such as crime, human rights, immigration, and other important things with varying social, economic and cultural parameters. Main claim to dispute: Recent activity (since 1990's) such as terrorism in general, the Arab Spring, revolt in Libya, Syria and others, ethnic cleansing in African countries and Yugoslavia, debt and financial crises, essentially where non-state actors or intrastate conflict is the subject matter, adversely impact the utility, prestige and relevance of International Relations as an academic discipline by demonstrating the decreased relevance of IR theories to contemporary events, decreased ability to predict and prepare for events, and decreased ability to offer insights to guide policy or find satisfactory solutions through the international system (UN, WHO, IMF, etc). CMV The issues listed above present a challenge for the international system, regime, order, or whatever it is being called now. As far as education goes, as universities continue to offer degree programs, these challenges are not exactly being analyzed through a systematic perspective; the academics are finding it difficult to respond to these issues (as are state actors). The issues we see today are difficult to analyze though an IR perspective. Since states are powerful institutions, they are expected to react to events but the professionals who work in this area may not have the tools to address these events. I regard study of transnational issues as a valid topic for IR. Student with a geographic focus or greater access through local friends and family may be more successful in predicting and anticipating events but that's not the norm. Edit: To illustrate the point better, the information leaks were an unpredictable but majorly important event. Response from countries has varied and long term effects on relationships will make themselves known. The immediate reaction from the Foreign policy team was probably \"well, what are we going to do now?\"",
        "The 57-year-old took over at Elland Road in April and is currently with the players on their pre-season tour of his native Italy. \"Next season I do not want one single player who lives outside of Leeds, no way. That is mandatory. \"Last year there were players who were coming late to games,\" Cellino told BBC Radio Leeds. Cellino added that next season before a home game the players will stay together, have dinner together and go to games together. \"It is important to do this because the players must be able to sleep well the day before a game and maybe they cannot do that if they have small children or if their neighbour is having a party,\" he said. \"I found out that most of the games that are close to Leeds we go to by bus, but we don't have our own. Why not? I would love to have a Leeds bus and I am going to buy one.\" Cellino is confident the club are close to bringing in more new signings following the PS11m departure of striker Ross McCormack to Fulham. The Championship side have brought in two players so far this summer, goalkeepers Stuart Taylor and Marco Silvestri. Midfielder Tommasso Bianchi and defender Jonathan Rossini, both of Serie A club Sassuolo, are currently training with the team, while Catania striker Souleymane Doukara is also expected to join. Leeds announced losses of PS9.5m for the 2012-13 financial year and Cellino said the club had to \"stop wasting money that isn't ours\" when he took over. Cellino, who claims that the club is now debt free, is now targeting a buyout of the 25 of the club still in the hands of previous owners GFH Capital as well as buying back Elland Road. \"There is no debt anymore and we have found a deal with GFH and I am glad for that,\" he added. \"We are close to raising PS30m of capital and that is without the money we got for McCormack. We did not budget for his sale because we did not want him to go. \"The decision to buy back the stadium had been made before Ross was sold but now we can use that money for the deal. We want to take back our house.\"",

        "Italian horror/suspense film about a wealthy English lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife Evelyn. You know he must have really loved his wife, because he brings them to his home - a huge, rotting castle - and makes them disrobe and then tortures them, whips them, and kills them. The most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the film's end, we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the HERO of the film. Anyway, soon, under the advice of his playboy uncle Roberto Maldera, De Teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncle's party. She moves in and strange things begin to happen to De Teffe's fragile state of mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally, well, just look at the title if you are still curious. Also, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Poor Aunt Agatha(she looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old) meets her fate in a foxy fashion. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course, there is a whole explanation as to why/how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does do some things fairly well: the settings in the film are well-suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is England is ludicrous at best. None of the actors look English. Many having dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an Englishman wouldn't be caught dead in. The cars drive on their wrong side of the road. But all that notwithstanding, the crypt scene was effectively shot and I liked the cheesy resolution too. And of course any film with the sultry, red-headed Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a streak of sexual perversion; however, which I found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons.

        "Many shower products, including shampoo, conditioner, and liquid body soap, come in plastic containers with some sort of cap. There are many variations of bottle designs, but overall we can group these into two categories: \"cap on top,\" where the cap is at the top of the bottle and as far from the base as possible, and \"cap on bottom\" where the bottle actually sits on its cap. Cap on bottom designs are a fairly recent invention, made possible by the use of arbitrary plastic shapes for liquid packaging. So I understand that cap on top designs are entrenched, culturally. Some products (often shampoo and conditioner pairs) actually use the same packaging, but with labels in opposite orientation to suggest that one end our the other is the top. I don't care about that: my only concern here is that the product can sit stably on the cap, regardless of whether the text is now upside down. I would count that as a \"cap on bottom\" design because the bottle can sit on its cap without concern of toppling. My argument is very simple: cap on bottom designs are better, because as the remaining liquid gets to a low level, it remains by the spout and can easily be ejected. Otherwise, high-viscosity liquids require a lot of shaking and squeezing to eject from the bottle, as they have settled to the end furthest from the spout. I believe cap on top designs (defined here as designs where the bottle cannot rest on its cap without being at risk of falling over) are functionally inferior, with no functional advantages. The only advantage to them at all is that, by having no concern for stability, the cap can be artistically shaped for visual pleasure in arbitrary ways. I don't think this is anywhere near as important as being able to easily access the contained product, and this I believe I would be happier if all liquid shower products had cap on bottom designs. Please try to convince me that the \"cap on top\" design has redeeming qualities, so I can stop being annoyed by them. CMV!",
        "In recent years, research on image generation methods has been developing\nfast. The auto-encoding variational Bayes method (VAEs) was proposed in 2013,\nwhich uses variational inference to learn a latent space from the image\ndatabase and then generates images using the decoder. The generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) came out as a promising framework, which uses\nadversarial training to improve the generative ability of the generator.\nHowever, the generated pictures by GANs are generally blurry. The deep\nconvolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) were then proposed to\nleverage the quality of generated images. Since the input noise vectors are\nrandomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution, the generator has to map from a\nwhole normal distribution to the images. This makes DCGANs unable to reflect\nthe inherent structure of the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndeep model, called generative adversarial networks with decoder-encoder output\nnoise (DE-GANs), which takes advantage of both the adversarial training and the\nvariational Bayesain inference to improve the performance of image generation.\nDE-GANs use a pre-trained decoder-encoder architecture to map the random\nGaussian noise vectors to informative ones and pass them to the generator of\nthe adversarial networks. Since the decoder-encoder architecture is trained by\nthe same images as the generators, the output vectors could carry the intrinsic\ndistribution information of the original images. Moreover, the loss function of\nDE-GANs is different from GANs and DCGANs. A hidden-space loss function is\nadded to the adversarial loss function to enhance the robustness of the model.\nExtensive empirical results show that DE-GANs can accelerate the convergence of\nthe adversarial training process and improve the quality of the generated\nimages.",

The house of Washington had been benevolent enough, and the American continents had prospered, but G IV had a bit of the bloodlust in him. The escalation of tensions between the UKotA at the UER led to it's inevitable responses and the two superpowers plunged the world into WW III.

        "Carnosaur 3 is bad... awfully bad. Bad to the point where it is funny. How matter how much I try to convince myself, I just can't believe anyone in this world could find this entertaining for serious reasons. I mean, come on, even the cover is bad! OK, the special effects are absolutely ridiculous. Those \"Carnosaurs\" are really ridiculous. A scientist tells the soldiers that they move incredibly fast, yet when you see them run, they run at the speed of... an actor in a rubber suit trying to run as much as he can. And the explosions are funny(there is no other word to describe it). At the beginning, a bullet hits a Jeep AFTER a guys says \"What was that?\"... And the other explosions are also laughable. But the worst thing is the screenplay and the so-called story. You don't expect a good story(or, I don't think anyone renting this movie expects a good movie) but at least the story has to try to make sense. I mean, how hard is it to make a story about dinosaurs killing people at least coherent. Incredibly hard if you look at this. Oh, and if you think that it's easy to makes believable commandos as your characters, tell it to the writers of this awful, awful piece of crap. I mean, what sick human being would make cheap jokes after one of his buddies is dead? And they do lots of it. And if you think that a movie about dinosaurs killing soldiers can only be at least action-packed, WAKE UP!!! This movie is incredibly dull. The carnosaurs(who invented this lame name anyway?) attack(in boring action sequences where you don't see much happening). The soldiers think of how to beat them(in incredibly funny scenes where they try real hard to be serious but can't seem to convince even just one second). So, then, they attack the carnosaurs, but their idea doesn't work(another laughable action sequence). Back to planning(with a few lame jokes thrown in) in another ridiculous scene. And this goes on, and on, and on. And let's not forget the acting which is about as convincing as the special effects... and the story... Oh OK, this movie simply sucks from A to Z.<br /><br />",
        "I strongly believe that an unemployed immigrant from, let's say Afghanistan, has more right for financial aid form the state, than a working man who's a citizen in my country (I'm from Denmark, but I believe it's the same way in other western countries, like the US). I believe this, because an unemployed has a harder time than an employed person, because he doesn't earn any money. I think that there shouldn't be made any difference between a Danish (or american) citizen, and an Immigrant. I believe this, because I believe that the rich countries have a responsibility for the poor people. No matter where they come from, or have their citizenship. I do believe it's okay to kick out immigrants who don't behave though, but to steal some chips in the local store is not enough. Furthermore I believe that the problems we have with immigrant gangs, especially with immigrants from the middle-east, are more our fault than theirs, simply because we don't have any opportunities for them. And with opportunities I mean stuff to do in their spare time. (I don't know if other countries have the same problem, although I believe USA have a problem with Mexican gangs) Many of the people I usually speak with don't agree with me, though I've never heard a truly great argument against it. Therefore I've come to CMV. Edit: As I've been made aware of issues of understanding this post I'll clarify some things: The aid I'm talking about is coming from the state to the people, the state being the country they live in (Denmark in this case) not the country they come from.

        "Schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer, says the education watchdog.Independent faith schools were singled out by Ofsted chief, David Bell, for not doing enough to promote the \"wider tenets of British society\". Mr Bell said Muslim, Jewish and Evangelical Christian schools must be \"intolerant of intolerance\". Diversity \"certainly must not mean segregated or separate\", he said. Mr Bell's speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.Badly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by Mr Bell, and in a speech to the Hansard Society, he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy, public service and shared values. He highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 Muslim, 100 Evangelical Christian and 50 Jewish schools.Mr Bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a \"common heritage\" and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion. \"I worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society,\" said Mr Bell. The Ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to Muslim schools. \"Many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in England and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony.\" Mr Bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were \"tricky issues\". But he argued that \"we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation\". \"I would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as British citizens, equal under the law, should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance, illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community, be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships,\" said Mr Bell.",
        "The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, analysed data from 48 separate trials. The Canadian team concluded that sticking to a diet was more important than the diet itself. Obesity experts said all diets cut calories to a similar level, which may explain the results. Diets go in and out of fashion on a regular basis, with a current debate around the relative benefits of low carb and low fat diets. Scientists at McMaster University in Ontario and the Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute in Toronto analysed data from 7,286 overweight dieters. The range of diets covered included, Atkins, South Beach, Zone, Biggest Loser, Jenny Craig, Nutrisystem, Volumetrics, Weight Watchers, Ornish and Rosemary Conley. It showed that after 12 months, people on low carbohydrate and low fat diets both lost an average of 7.3kg (16lb). Those on low carb meal plans had lost slightly more at the six-month marker. The report said: \"The differences [between diets] were small and unlikely to be important to those seeking weight loss.\" It concluded: \"Our findings should be reassuring to clinicians and the public that there is no need for a one-size-fits-all approach to dieting because many different diets appear to offer considerable weight loss benefits. \"Our findings suggest that patients may choose, among those associated with the largest weight loss, the diet that gives them the least challenges with adherence.\" However, the study did not look at wider health issues, such as levels of cholesterol, which may vary according to diet. Prof Susan Jebb, from the University of Oxford and a government advisor on obesity, said diets were more similar than they appeared, advocating cutting calories to 1,500 a day, sticking to strict meal times and avoiding biscuits, cakes and chocolate. \"The issue is about adherence and it's how closely and how long can you keep sticking to the plan over time that matters. \"That probably means finding the right diet for you, rather than one being so particularly better than the others.\" She said people should try to match diets to their lives. Vegetarians would struggle more with a high protein, low carb diet, while people living on their own may find liquid (instead of meals) diets easier than those who would still have to cook for a family.",
        "This has been wearing on me for a while. In America, (and perhaps elsewhere), there is this culture of believing that all consequences in our lives are the result of our actions, and therefore we deserve absolute creditblame for all aspects of our lives. i.e. \"I went to business school and worked my way up, therefore those who have not had my level of success aren't working hard\" OR \"I did these things to try to put myself in a good position, but I'm not in one. I must not be trying hard enoughI must not deserve to be in a good position.\" The fundamental flaw with this philosophy is an over-emphasis on the power of our volition over the powerful influences of society. I'm not sure of this is rooted in a fear of lacking control over our lives or some other factor, but the fact of the matter is that our volition has an almost insignificant effect on our lives when compared to circumstance. Your birthplace, your parents, the circumstances of their lives during your upbringing, the actions of others (which, though based at least party on volition, are collectively more impactful than one's own), and your overall experiences that you gather throughout life form your knowledge are all influences that are undeniably greater than what you choose to do one day. They determine what you choose to do everyday. Unfortunately, society doesn't work in a manner that's conducive to this philosophy. Every day, there are people who are born on third base and think they hit a triple who look down on those beneath them, and every day, there are people on the bottom who are looking up and wondering where they went wrong. I'm not arguing over the amount of social mobility here, merely the attitudes within our culture that it reflects. As a result of this belief, people fail to realize that they are at a systematic disadvantage, and they are therefore unable to change the game instead of willingly continuing to lose. TL;DR: Meritocracy is a sham, and it dominates our will while it masquerades as a celebration of it. CMV.",
        "You said your mother-in-law lives with you. Does she pay rent, or are you splitting the cost of housing? That would also have to figured into the equation.  If you had a business you would now have to declare the expense on your business taxes. This would also then be income for her, which she would have to account for on her taxes. Remember there are both state and federal taxes involved. Regarding expenses like diapers. If the MIL had the business she could deduct them as a business expense. If you have the business it would greatly complicate the taxes. Your business would be essentially covering your personal expenses. If your MIL was not a business the cost of diapers would be paid by you regardless of the working situation of you and your spouse. To claim the tax credit: You must report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number   (either the social security number, or the employer identification   number) of the care provider on your return. If the care provider is a   tax-exempt organization, you need only report the name and address on   your return. You can use Form W-10 (PDF), Dependent Care Provider's   Identification and Certification, to request this information from the   care provider. If you do not provide information regarding the care   provider, you may still be eligible for the credit if you can show   that you exercised due diligence in attempting to provide the required   information. The IRS will be looking for an income tax form from your MIL that claims the income.  Getting too cute with the babysitting situation, by starting a business just for the purpose of saving money on taxes could invite an audit. Also it is not as if you just claim 3000 and you are good to go. You can only claim a percentage of the expenses based on the household AGI, the more the make the more you have to have in expenses to get the full 3000 credit, which mil cause more taxes for your MIL. Plus the whole issue with having to pay social security and other taxes on a household employee. It might be best to skip the risk of the audit. Claiming your MIL as a dependent might just be easier.",
        "In one word... abysmal. I give it one star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women, otherwise forget it. Corman's worst effort, bar none. Ben Vereen should have had his name permanently stricken from the cast. I cannot believe that this is now going to be on DVD (as of 2/15/05) with \"Wild In The Streets\" - another retro stinker. I woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold, decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some, scanned the digital channels... the premise looked interesting enough because I like viewing B-movie sci-fi, hippie culture and rebellious teen flicks. It seemed familiar somehow and with Ben Vereen in the cast, I thought... why not? What a big mistake... it was a horrible start to my day.<br /><br />Only after viewing it, I now know why the familiarity crept into the recesses of my newly-awakened brain. I remembered seeing coming attractions for this film as a 14-year old (I'm 45), back in the early/mid-seventies at the Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even groaned out loud at how bad this movie looked.

If you choose to watch this after my warning, remember... \"I told you so.\"<br /><br />\"Gass-s-s-s\" is the perfect title for this film... you feel \"gassed\" after viewing this putrid movie - or maybe that you should be taken to a \"gas\" chamber for wasting your brain away.

        "I am a bisexual male. Whenever I tell people I am bisexual people say \"but you act so straight!\" and \"My gaydar would never have found you!.\" The idea of a \"gaydar\" is extremely offensive to me. Nothing about how a person acts indicates their sexuality, as it has nothing to do with their personality. Unless you see a guy sucking a dick you don't know what his sexuality is. I hate gay pride parades. They claim to speak for me. They don't. All that they do is tell the world that all gay people like rainbows, weird fetishes, and are obnoxiously flamboyant. Am I not bisexual because I don't fit these stereotypes? I am fine with flamboyant pride parades. If you want to be flamboyant than go for it. You shouldn't be ridiculed by society for it. I won't hang out with you, and you probably won't want to hang out with me, but that's fine. Also these stereotypes promote homophobia because disliking flamboyant people is fine. Just like disliking conservative people is fine (not politically conservative but socially). Since they portray all gay people as extremely flamboyant many people assume they dislike all gay people. Being flamboyant has nothing to do with being gay. So please explain to me why these cartoonish stereotypes of gay people promoted by the gay pride movement is somehow a good thing for gays.

        "Partners of those who love their hi-tech gear may want to get their presents in early as experts predict a gadget shortage this Christmas.With Apple's iPod topping wish lists again, there may not be enough iPod minis to go round, predicts Oliver Irish, editor of gadget magazine Stuff. \"The iPod mini is likely to be this year's Tracey Island,\" said Mr Irish. Stuff has compiled a list of the top 10 gadgets for 2004 and the iPod is at number one.For anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market, Stuff and What Hi-Fi? are hosting a best-of gadget show in London this weekend. Star of the show will be Sony's Qrio Robot, an all-singing, all-dancing, football-playing man-machine who can even hold intelligent conversations.But he is not for sale and Sony has no commercial plans for the robot. \"He will greet visitors and is flying in from Japan. He probably has his own airplane seat, that is how highly Sony prize him,\" said Mr Irish. Also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface. The event will play host to a large collection of digital music players, from companies such as Creative, Sony and Philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable iPod from Apple. Suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless Christmas are unlikely to come true as MP3 players remain the most popular stocking filler, said Mr Irish. \"Demand is huge and Apple has promised that it can supply enough but people might struggle to get their hands on iPod minis,\" said Mr Irish.For those who like their gadgets to be multi-talented, the Gizmondo, a powerful gaming console with GPS and GPRS, that also doubles up as an MP3 player, movie player and camera, could be a must-have. \"What is impressive is how much it can do and how well it can do them,\" said Mr Irish. This Christmas, gadgets will not be an all-male preserve. \"Women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves,\" said Mr Irish. \"Gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks.\"",

        "Actually , how wings work is a fairly simple concept made needlessly complicated . I 'll try to explain . Imagine a flat piece of metal moving through the air , it 's flat side is hitting the air \" head - on \" . Now I think most people would agree that just in front of the piece of metal there 'd be air \" bunching up \" , there 'd be slightly higher pressure in front of the plate since it 's sort of pushing the air out of the way and the air ca n't get out of the way fast enough . This means , of course , that just behind the metal plate there is * less * air and less pressure , the air is getting pushed out of the way by the plate and it has to rush in behind it to fill in the void at the back . This is essentially drag , we 're all familiar with this and it 's vital to things like drafting . But now comes the interesting part : Tilt the plate forwards , let 's say by 45 ° . Now your high pressure area is going to be slightly * below * the plate and the low pressure area is going to be slightly * above * . And as you can imagine , if you have high pressure below and low pressure above , you 're going to be pushed * up * and that is basically how wing 's work . Why is this important ? Notice that nowhere did I mention the wing has to have a special \" airfoil \" shape to it . In truth , the airfoil shape of wings is not strictly necessary . It 's there because it makes planes more efficient but really you can get perfectly good lift from a flat piece of metal . A wing will still generate lift when upside - down because it 's fundamental shape has n't changed : it 's still pretty much a flat piece of metal . The fact that the airfoil shape is now upside down only means that the wing is less efficient , so the plane may be slower and probably a bit more unstable , but it * will * still generate lift . The important thing is having that flat piece of metal and angling it correctly towards that stream of air , that angle is the vaunted \" angle of attack \" .",
        "Ultra high speed wi-fi connections moved closer to reality on Thursday when Intel said it would list standards for the technology later this year.Intel is developing ultra-wideband technology (UWB) which would allow fast data transfer but with low power needs. UWB is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless USB devices which need low power consumption. A rival UWB standard is being developed by Motorola and chip firm Freescale. At the mobile phone conference 3GSM in Cannes last month Samsung demonstrated a phone using UWB technology from Freescale.At a press conference on Thursday Intel announced that two UWB groups, WiMedia Alliance and Multi-band OFDM alliance had merged to support the technology. UWB makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. One of the more likely uses of UWB is to make it possible to send DVD quality video images wirelessly to TV screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home.The technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second. \"Consumer electronics companies want UWB to replace cables and simplify set-up,\" Jeff Ravencraft, technology strategist at Intel and chairman of the Wireless USB Promoter Group, told technology site ZDNet. \"Thirty percent of consumer electronics returns are because the consumer couldn't set up the equipment.\" The first products using UWB technology from Intel are due to hit the market later this year. Initially they will be products using wireless USB 2.0 connections. UWB could also be used to create so-called Personal Area Networks that let a person's gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. The technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. Intel says the benefit of UWB is that it does not interfere with other wi-fi technologies already in use such as wi-fi, wimax and mobile phone networks.",
        "The French co-head of European defence and aerospace group EADS Philippe Camus is to leave his post.Mr Camus said in a statement that he has accepted the invitation to return full-time to the Lagardere group, which owns 30% of EADS. \"I will give up my role as soon as the board of directors asks me to do so,\" he said. Airbus head Noel Forgeard is now set to replace Mr Camus, bringing the company's power struggle to an end. Fighting between Mr Camus and Mr Forgeard has hit the headlines in France and analysts feared that this fighting could destabilise the defence and aerospace group. French finance minister Herve Gaymard is on record as saying that he \"deplored\" the infighting at the company. The company should now be able put this dispute behind it, with the departure of Mr Camus and with the clear support given to Mr Forgeard by the Lagardere group, the main French shareholder of EADS. The other main shareholders of EADS are the French government (15%) , who also support Mr Forgeard, and Germany's DaimlerChrysler (30%). Rainer Hertrich, the German co-head of EADS will also step down when his contract expires next year.Mr Camus recently came under pressure as it became clear that the A380 superjumbo was running over budget. EADS - Airbus' majority owner - admitted earlier this week that the project was running 1.45bn euros (£1bn; $1.9bn) over budget. But Mr Forgeard has denied this, telling French media that there is no current overrun in the budget. \"But for the sake of transparency, we told our shareholders last week that if we look at the forecast for total costs of the project up to 2010, there is a risk that we will go over by around 10%, which is about 1bn euros (£686m; $1.32bn),\" he told France's LCI Television. Due to enter service in 2006, the A380 will replace the Boeing 747 jumbo as the world's biggest passenger aircraft.",
        "In financial theory, there is no reason for a difference in investor return to exist between dividend paying and non-dividend paying stocks, except for tax consequences.  This is because in theory, a company can either pay dividends to investors [who can reinvest the funds themselves], or reinvest its capital and earn the same return on that reinvestment [and the shareholder still has the choice to sell a fraction of their holdings, if they prefer to have cash]. That theory may not match reality, because often companies pay or don't pay dividends based on their stage of life.  For example, early-stage mining companies often have no free cashflow to pay dividends [they are capital intensive until the mines are operational]. On the other side, longstanding companies may have no projects left that would be a  good fit for further investment, and so they pay out dividends instead, effectively allowing the shareholder to decide where to reinvest the money. Therefore, saying \"dividend paying\"/\"growth stock\" can be a proxy for talking about the stage of life + risk and return of a company. Saying dividend paying implies \"long-standing blue chip company with relatively low capital requirements and a stable business\". Likewise \"growth stocks\" [/ non-dividend paying] implies \"new startup company that still needs capital and thus is somewhat unproven, with a chance for good return to match the higher risk\". So in theory, dividend payment policy makes no difference. In practice, it makes a difference for two reasons: (1) You will most likely be taxed differently on selling stock vs receiving dividends [Which one is better for you is a specific question relying on your jurisdiction, your current income, and things like what type of stock / how long you hold it]. For example in Canada, if you earn ~ < $40k, your dividends are very likely to have a preferential tax treatment to selling shares for capital gains [but your province and specific other numbers would influence this]. In the United States, I believe capital gains are usually preferential as long as you hold the shares for a long time [but I am not 100% on this without looking it up]. (2) Dividend policy implies differences in the stage of life / risk level of a stock. This implication is not guaranteed, so be sure you are using other considerations to determine whether this is the case.  Therefore which dividend policy suits you better depends on your tax position and your risk tolerance.",
        "I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general. As I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people. I can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex.

However, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else. I sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this . I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve. Ignorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve). So to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV Edit: I know violence won't get me anywhere. Are there any other solutions besides time, education and ignorng other people that can remedy the situation more directly?",
        "It comes from the days of slide rules . To see how a slide rule works , imagine trying to perform basic addition by using two normal rulers . To add 2 + 3 you could find 2 on the first ruler , then line the end of the second ruler up with it . You then find the 3 on the second ruler and see what number it lines up against on the first ruler : 5 . Slide rules use the same concept , but instead of adding simple numbers it adds the log of numbers . This is useful because of the identity that Log(A ) + Log(B ) = Log(A\\*B ) . That means that we can convert a multiplication problem into an addition problem , then solve that addition problem using the ticks on a scale . There 's an issue with this , though : what happens if you try to add 13 + 13 using 12 - inch rulers ? You run out of space ! To avoid that same problem from happening on a slide rule the operator is expected to keep track of the powers of 10 themselves . This is why scientific notation is used – it 's the exact format that 's conducive to using a slide rule ! This means that instead of computing 127\\*7,891 you would use the slide rule to compute 1.27\\*7.891 and then manually compute 10 ^ 2 \\ * 10^(3 ) ( which is just 10^(5 ) ) . You split the logarithm up into an easy - to - compute whole number and a difficult - to - compute but finitely sized decimal . That only works when it 's really easy to compute the whole number . If we use base 10 for the logarithm then that 's as simple as counting the digits ( or , in scientific notation , it 's just given to us ) . This makes the base-10 logarithm the obvious one to use . It 's also worth noting that once you can compute one logarithm you can compute any logarithm . If you want the base 2 log just take log(n)/log(2 ) . Since you only need one logarithmic scale on a slide rule it makes sense to use the one that helps other operations most directly .",
        "The 28-year-old Erskine has agreed a pre-contract to sign for Thistle on a three-year deal in June. Manager Alan Archibald expects to lose Bannigan in the summer. \"We were aware of him being out of contract in at the end of the season and Dundee United hadn't made a move on it,\" he said of Erskine. \"We have went through the right channels and have that in place and it's a good one to look forward to for next season.\" It will be Erskine's third spell with United's Scottish Premiership rivals. He started his career at Firhill before moving to Tannadice in 2013, only to be loaned back later that season. But he was a first-team regular with the Tangerines last season. This term, he missed out during September, October and November through injury but returned to action in December. Asked if Erskine could join Thistle during the January transfer window, Archibald told BBC Scotland: \"That's down to Dundee United. \"He's their player and we have to respect that and we've just put that in place for next season.\" Archibald laughed off newspaper headlines suggesting that he had threatened to resign should Bannigan be sold during January. \"It was tongue in cheek what I said in the papers,\" he said. \"But I would be devastated and we'll not let him go. \"It would need to be crazy money to let him go. \"It would not be worth it for us as he is a key player. \"If you let your key player go in January for what would not be a great amount of money would send out all the wrong signals.\" However, asked about reported interest by Aberdeen, Archibald said: \"It is just paper talk. There have been a few linked with him. \"He's a good player and out of contract and we expect that. \"We know he is going to go in the summer - he will get good offers. \"But there is no bitterness. We won't get a fee for him, but we've had four or five years out of him playing at the top of his game.\"",
        "No one can really answer this for you.  It is a matter of personal preference and the details of your situation.  There are some really smart people on here, when placed in your exact situation, would do completely different things.  Personal finance is overall, personal. If it was me, I'd never borrow money in retirement.  If I had the cash, I'd use it to help fund the purchase.  If I didn't, I simply wouldn't.  For me wealth retention (in your case) is surprisingly more about behavior than math (even though I am a math guy).  You are simply creating a great deal of risk at a season in your life with a diminished ability to recover from negative events.  In my opinion you are inviting \"tales of woe\" to be part of your future if you borrow. Others would disagree with me.  They would point to the math and show how you would be much better off on borrowing instead of pulling out of investments provided a sufficient return on your nest egg.  They may even have a case as you might have to pay taxes on money pulled out magnifying the difference in net income on borrowing versus pulling out in a lump sum.  Here in the US, the money you pulled out would be taxed at the highest marginal rate.  To help with a down payment of 50K, you might have to pull out 66,500 to pay the taxes and have enough for the down payment. The third option is to not help with a down payment or to help them in a different way.  Perhaps giving them a few hundred per month for two years to help with their mortgage payment.  Maybe watch their kids some to reduce day care costs or help with home improvements so they can buy a lower price home.  Those are all viable options.  Perhaps the child is not ready to buy a home. Having said all that it really depends on your situation.  Say your sitting on 5 million in investments, your pensions is sufficient to have some disposable income, and they are asking for a relatively small amount.  Then pull the money out and don't be concerned.  You nest egg will quickly recover the money.",
        "The early middle ages can be viewed as effectively the worst economic depression western civilization has ever faced . Coupled with - and contributing to - that downturn was a sudden and overwhelming lack of law and order because the political and economic system that had previously maintained it - the Roman Empire - lay in ruins . For these reasons , Europe started over economically . Europe developed a system over a series of centuries where virtually all power and wealth had to be created locally . It was an agrarian society , and its basic unit was a man 's labor . Specialization became inefficient ; if a town could not produce enough food to feed itself , there was no point producing goods that required specialized labor , like wine or clothing , for export . A local lord could control as much land , and therefore as much wealth , as he could effectively protect . Over time , this system built itself into a pyramid where the wealth created locally in farms was handed upward to increasingly powerful lords promising to defend more and more territory until you came to a King who claimed to protect them all . In turn , all of the lower sections of the pyramid would swear to help the lord above them - up to the King - in his causes and wars . You can see how in this system , wealth and power were intimately linked , and furthermore , that wealth was more easily expressed in land than in any concept of money . A modern CEO can define his wealth and power in his company and its well - measured incomes and expenses . But a Medieval lord was defined by the country he ruled : obviously , the Duke of Provence was better off than the Duke of Northumberland because Provence would be larger , better positioned for trade and much easier to farm . Therefore , an up - and - coming member of the vast interwoven noble class of Europe would rather become Duke of Provence through whatever means were at his disposal . Obviously , there was trade during the middle ages . However it was difficult , expensive and exceptionally dangerous . On the other hand , a fortunate merchant stood to gain vast amounts of money by transporting products from where they were produced to wherever people would pay more for them . Ultimately , this is what slowly broke down the feudal system . A new and growing merchant class began to compete with the noble class for local power , and ultimately won it . This also led to improved roads and other trade routes and incentivized greater specialization of labor , allowing some towns to specialize in products that were not necessarily food .",

I understand the tradition of improvisation over top but there is no reason an artist couldn't improvise off of a more original or unique or simply less used chord progression. I appreciate the tones and rhythms and pure shredding abilities of good improv soloists. Why couldn't they apply all of those spectacular abilities to a more varied set of harmonies. I have been told that the progression facilitates more amateur and unrehearsed group play, which is true. How is it that so many practitioners of the common have achieved legendary status with their use of this over-simplified use of a major variable in tonal music (pop, jazz, blues or otherwise)? I don't mean to sound intentionally negative; this question has cut short my enjoyment of Jimi Hendrix, BB King, Johnny Cash, and many more beloved song writers. I am an artist and would truly like to open my mind up to this style of play. I am interested to hear your opinions and justifications for songs with this progression. I feel a similar sentiment for other progressions. Namely: 1. I-V-vi-IV 2.I-ii-IV-V 3.i-VII-VI-v Forgive me if I have mentioned a favorite artist or touched a nerve. I have found this to be a sensitive subject in the past. I know it is difficult to debate something as intangible as art, but we aren't talking facts after all; just views. Hello, users of CMV!

        "While the other people have tried to answer your question as thoroughly as possible, I fear they are entirely incorrect in answering your question itself as it stands. The answer is that there are no usual terms. There are a handful of different options coming out now for this exact scheme. Examples include the UK Governments \"Help To Buy\" scheme. Accomodation is offered at a normal rate, and a small portion of the rent is set aside each month. At the end of a fixed period, that money becomes a deposit which the letter hands over to a mortgage provider who accepts it as a deposit. This might well be a terminology thing, since the other scenario which people described falls into the same name you've used. That scenario is where the investor who owns the property is considering sale of the property, and is happy to negotiate a price up front for the next year. Usually the rent and price is higher than the market rate because if the market goes well over the next year they could end up out of pocket. Putting that into perspective, over that year they are gaining their $1,000 a month or so, but having $100,000 invested means a return of 12%. If the property value is over $250,000 which I believe to be more likely, they are achieving a return of (I think) 4.8%. That's not a bad rate, by any means, but realistically they are losing a bit more for maintenance, and they could be making more from their money. If the market were to go up in that time by more than 4.8% (my house, for instance, increased in value by over 15% in the last 12 months), they are making a substantial loss since you are getting a house at 15% below the market rate. The total works out to a 10.2% loss for them. Note that I don't know the US housing market at all, I'm speaking mostly from my experience of the market here in the UK. This is what I hear, what I see, and what I've played. To summarise a bit: Make sure you check your terms before signing anything.",
        "On Saturday afternoon, members of the public have been invited to take part in planting thousands of new trees at Brackfield Wood in the Faughan Valley. The project has been organised by the Woodland Trust, and is one of four new woods being created across the UK. Its aim is to plant \"millions\" of native UK trees to commemorate the millions of people who died during WW1. The four-year project is one of the trust's most ambitious planting programmes and uses the pledge: \"We will stand for those who fell.\" In Brackfield Wood, the conservation charity plans to plant 40,000 trees in tribute to the estimated 40,000 people from the island of Ireland who lost their lives in the conflict. The trust said it was inviting local people and visitors to the Faughan Valley to \"get involved and to make a mark on history through the simple act of tree planting.\" Its director, Patrick Cregg, said: \"This is a special opportunity to make a personal and hands-on contribution to Brackfield Wood, still very much in its infancy. We do hope that as many people as possible will join us, roll their sleeves up, and plant a tree. \"By the end of the project, our aim is to have 40,000 native trees planted here at Brackfield, with carpets of wildflowers including iconic poppies. It will be a place where wildlife will thrive and where people can walk, relax and reflect.\" The charity is providing the saplings for members of the public to plant, and has advised volunteers to wear welly boots or \"stout footwear.\" Brackfield Wood is about seven miles outside Derry city, just off the Glenshane Road and limited parking is available for those taking part in the project. \"The trees, which will stand for generations to come, will be a living, growing tribute to the people from Ireland who played a part in the war: the soldiers, their families and loved ones,\" Mr Cregg said.",
        "Ministers are to publish draft laws they say are a \"landmark\" in prohibiting the substances' production, distribution, sale and supply. Legal highs, officially called new psychoactive substances, have been linked to a number of deaths. Ministers said young people who took them were \"taking exceptional risks with their health.\" A blanket ban on legal highs, which are often sold online or on the high street, was in the Conservative Party's election manifesto and featured in the Queen's Speech. Labour also promised to ban their sale and distribution in its manifesto. The Psychoactive Substances Bill applied to \"any substance intended for human consumption that is capable of producing a psychoactive effect,\" the government said. Alcohol, tobacco and caffeine will be excluded, and there are also exemptions for food and medical products, while controlled drugs will continue to be regulated by existing laws. The new restrictions will also extend to the sale of nitrous oxide - also known as laughing gas or \"hippy crack\" - for human use. What are legal highs? The government said the \"legitimate sale\" of nitrous oxide, which is also used for food processing, medicinal and industrial purposes, would not be affected. Home Office minister Mike Penning said the measures would \"fundamentally change the way we tackle new psychoactive substances.\" They would end the \"game of cat and mouse\" whereby new drugs appeared on the market more quickly than the government could identify and ban them, he said. He added: \"The blanket ban will give police and other law enforcement agencies greater powers to tackle the reckless trade in psychoactive substances, instead of having to take a substance-by-substance approach.\" Legal highs are not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act, although individual substances, such as mephedrone, have been outlawed. The government's proposals would apply throughout the United Kingdom, and would include powers to seize and destroy legal highs and to search people, premises and vehicles. Civil measures - including prohibition notices and prohibition orders - will also be possible. Commander Simon Bray, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: \"A blanket ban on new psychoactive substances will make it simpler for law enforcement to deal with those drugs which are potentially unsafe but which may not yet be controlled.\"",
        "It is my opinion that part of having a successful long-term relationship is being committed to the other person's success and well-being. This commitment is a form of investment in and of itself. The returns are typically non-monetary, so it's important to understand what money actually is. Money is a token people exchange for favors. If I go to a deli and ask for a sandwich. I give them tokens for the favor of having received a sandwich. The people at the deli then exchange those tokens for other favors, and that's the entire economy: people doing favors for other people in exchange for tokens that represent more favors. Sometimes being invested in your spouse is giving them a back rub when they've had a hard day. The investment pays off when you have a hard day and they give you a back rub. Sometimes being invested in your spouse is taking them to a masseuse for a professional massage. The investment pays off when they get two tickets to that thing you love. At the small scale it's easy to mostly ignore minor monetary discrepancies. At the large scale (which I think £50k is plenty large enough given your listed net worth) it becomes harder to tell if the opportunity cost will be worth making that investment. It pretty much comes down to: Will the quality-of-life improvements from that investment be better than the quality-of-life improvements you receive from investing that money elsewhere? As far as answering your actual question of: How should I proceed? There isn't a one-size fits all answer to this. It comes down to decisions you have to make, such as: * in theory it's easy to say that everyone should be able to trust their spouse, but in practice there are a lot of people who are very bad at handling money. It can be worthwhile in some instances to keep your spouse at an arms length from your finances for their own good, such as if your spouse has a gambling addiction. With all of that said, it sounds like you're living in a £1.5m house rent-free. How much of an opportunity cost is that to your wife? Has she been freely investing in your well-being with no explicit expectation of being repaid? This can be your chance to provide a return on her investment. If it were me, I'd make the investment in my spouse, and consider it \"rent\" while enjoying the improvements to my quality of life that come with it.",
        "A planning application has been made for the development on green belt land at Park of Keir, near Dunblane. However a council planning and policy consultation stated the development \"cannot be supported in policy terms.\" A spokesman for Park of Keir Partners said they would discuss the report with Stirling Council planning officers. Murray, mother of tennis star Andy, and golfer Montgomerie announced plans for the facility, Scotland's first purpose-built golf and tennis centre, last summer. The proposed facility would include six indoor and six outdoor tennis courts, a nine-hole golf course with a practice range, coaching suites and a cafe, along with around 100 houses and a hotel. However, some local residents raised concerns about the development being sited on green belt land between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan. These concerns were echoed in an official planning and policy document authored by Claire Milne, a principal planning officer at Stirling Council. Her report concluded that the planned housing - included in the project to subsidise the cost of the sports facilities - \"is not intended to meet any of the local or particular housing needs, and will in fact exacerbate affordability in the local area.\" While the tennis, golf and tourism element of the proposal would \"provide a degree of social as well as economic benefit to the local area,\" the report noted that the business case submitted was \"not sufficiently convincing.\" The report also states that there is no \"overriding national need\" or a local need for the project to be sited on green belt land, a \"sensitive landscape\" which would suffer a \"significant detrimental impact\" from the development. A spokesman for Park of Keir Partners said it was \"normal practice\" for planning officers to carry out a policy review. He added: \"We plan to meet with the council's planning officers to address a number of the comments in this report and we remain confident our proposed development represents sufficient benefit to the people of the area, and Scotland as a whole, to allow members of the planning committee to approve our application.\" A date has not yet been set for councillors to consider the application.",
        "There was someone at my door. This normally would be fine and there would't be a problem except that based on the sounds of his curses he thought this was his house.'Well' I thought'I'm new here and this is a good way to meet new people.' Unfortunately just as I was about to reach the door it evaporated in a purple mist. \"Uh hi.\" I tried. \"How did you gain entrance to my lair?\" He thundered rushing me and shoving me back against the wall. With one hand he raised my body till my head was touching the ceiling. \"I...... Live..... Here.\" I managed to croak out. \"Ah.\" He said looking around and realizing that this wasn't his house. \"My humblest apologies.\" He said. \"It would appear I have entered the wrong home. \" \"I wouldn't worry about it except for the door.\" I replied. \"It helps me pretend like a supervillian isn't able to burst in at anytime.\" \"You aren't going to attack me?\" He seemed startled. \"No, heavens no. \" \"But I broke your door. I...\" He trailed off. \"What's your power?\" He demanded. \"Calm down.\" I said as purple mist began swirling around his hands. \"You must be Dark Phantom. Look my name is Joe. It's nice to meet you but I don't want any trouble. \" \"I said. What is your power?\" He boomed. \"I don't have a power.\" I said. \"I swear everyone has some kind of power but I'm just a regular citizen probably the regular citizen. \" \"But you aren't going to cry for help?\" The purple was starting to dissipate. \"You seem like an alright chap. As long as you help me fix up a new door we should be just fine.\" I replied. Purple flared again and previously exploded door rematerialized. \"Well uh I'll be on my way then.\" He said twisting the new handle and returning to the dark night. Just another incredible day in the life of Average Joe!",
        "I saw this movie a million years (5 years to be exact) ago for the first the time. In the light of recent events with the Australian woman Schapelle Corby being imprisoned in Indonesia for so called smuggling pot, I decided to watch this movie again. I excepted to cry my heart out, 'cause I'm sucker for hot girls in need (just read my review of 'the stalking of Laurie Show'). Some moist escaped my eyes, but it were hardly buckets filled with tears. Why? Not because the two heroines weren't utterly adoring and helpless, not because the movie wasn't heartbreaking at the sight of these two kids in the prime of their live locked up in almost inhuman conditions. Why then? Why did I not cry? I wanted to cry! When I rent a movie like this, I except to be moved, to sob like there's no tomorrow, to feel miserable and like it. This movie was simply too short to do this. It was just like the script was reduced to the main plot elements, and while doing this the psychological aspect was thrown aside. Clare Danes and Kate Beckinsale did an excellent job portraying the emotions of the two friends, but this movie just screamed for more footage of these girls in their depressing (and oppressing) surroundings. The mental journey is missing here for some reason. You only get to see the key moments of it (which are very touching, I admit), probably because of bad editing. Sometimes I felt these girls were walking around in a postcard. The relationship with the family members could also have used a bit more attention. What's up with the relationships between the girls and the parents (especially between Alice and her dad)? You catch a glimpse of it, but the film doesn't quite offer the whole picture, sadly enough.<br /><br />Nonetheless this was a great movie, and at the end I even had to bite my lip a bit. But I guess this has more to do with the acting skills (and the looks) of the actresses (and the music) then with the merit of the director. To be honest, I hardly knew who Kate Beckinsale was before I watched this movie (again). Now, I am a fan! Great movie, as long as you don't expect it to be classic cinema.",
        "\"Sex on the beach, please,\" Lisa said to the bartender. \"My kind of woman!\" a mystery voice piped up. Lisa turned to see a man in a dark suit with a bright red tie. His black hair was parted on the side and slicked back. He looked much different than the picture on his online profile, particularly his thin, sparsely grown mustache. As if he heard her thoughts, the man lifted his hand and stroked his mustache with his thumb and index finger. \"You must be Lisa.\" Lisa pulled her mouth into a smile. \"You must be Alexander.\" Alexander nodded. \"Six bucks,\" the bartender said, placing Lisa's drink onto the bar. Alexander stepped up and waved a hand in front of the bartender's face. \"These aren't the droids you're looking for.\" \"What?\" The bartender stared at Alexander. \"Alexander glared back into the bartender's eyes. \"The drink is on the house.\" \"The fuck it is,\" the bartender replied. Alexander stroked his mustache again and cleared his throat. \"Sir,\" he said, and held up his wrist to display his watch. \"Can you tell me what time it is?\" The bartender ignored the watch. \"It's time for you to pay six dollars.\" \"Um, it's okay, I can pay,\" Lisa said. Alexander rejected her offer with a fluttering wave of his hand. \"No, trust me, I never pay.\" \"You never pay?\" The bartender said. \"Ok, well you need to go now.\" Alexander spoke quickly. \"Listen very closely to the sound of my voice. As you listen you find yourself growing very sleepy. So sleepy you can't keep your eyes open.\" \"I work nights. I sleep all day. I'm not tired,\" the bartender said, gesturing to the bouncer. The bouncer, an exceedingly large man in a tight t-shirt, took Alexander firmly by his lapels and escorted him from the building. Lisa pulled a handful of bills from her purse. The bartender shook his head. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"After all that, it's on the house.\"",

        "Asha Gond is an Indian skateboarder from Madhya Pradesh. She represented India in the 2018 World Skateboarding Championship and leads a non-profit organisation, Barefoot Skateboarders. The 2021 Netflix film, Skater Girl, is believed to be based on her life.\n\nEarly life and career\nAsha Gond was born to Dharmraj and Kamala Gond in the village of Janwar in Panna district in Madhya Pradesh to a family of farmers. Gond completed her high schooling from Manohar Kanya High School, Janwar and is an Adivasi. When Ulrike Reinhard came up with the idea and created the skatepark in the village in 2015, Gond was one of many children who began to learn and practice skateboarding. The students had no formal training and learned from YouTube videos. Due to the rules laid down by Reinhard, the children were not distracted from their studies, gave girls the first priority with the few skateboards available, and did not discriminate on the basis of caste. Gond still faced insults and threats from her fellow villagers, who believed that she should continue with the regressive traditions imposed on the women of the village.\n\nIn 2016, Reinhard helped crowdfund Gond's education in the English language at The Butler Centre for Education in Wantage, Oxfordshire, England, about  from Oxford. Gond had initially dropped out of school after Class XI. She became the first child in her village to travel abroad.\n\nGond also went on to participate in many national level skateboarding competitions and was India's only female skateboarder at the 2018 World Skateboarding Championship, held in Nanjing, China. She also co-founded and runs Barefoot Skateboarders, a non-profit organisation working to improve the education and development of the children in Janwar village. She has also been featured skateboarding in a TV advertisement for tyres.\n\nFollowing the release of the trailer of Skater Girl, netizens familiar with the story of Reinhard and Gond found striking similarities between the movie and Gond's life. While Gond was interviewed as part of the production of the film, director Manjari Makijany denied that the movie was about Gond.\n\nReferences\n\nYear of birth missing (living people)\nIndian sportspeople\nLiving people",
        "He sat alone at the small writing table, the mechanical sound of the typewrite's keys being used echoed in the room. He could do anything, create anything, be anyone, if he so desired. In one room in the mansion he created himself, was piles of money, and in another, large and open as a theater, was a library brimming with every book imaginable. There were dozens of rooms with dozens of things the he thought he wanted. But with everything at his fingertips, he still felt alone, felt unworthy of it all, ever since his wife died a year ago. Two months after her funeral, he received the typewriter in the mail from an unknown address, attached was a small letter reading, \"Be God, create!\" And so, he did. Now, however, he needed his wife. The loneliness was too much, none of the picture perfect women with the perfectly crafted personalities filled the empty void. As he held tears at bay, he typed into the machine, \"My wife, Trisha Henry.\" He yanked away his hands, as if the typewriter was burning hot, then waited and waited, and waited. An hour, then two, went by with no sound except his breathing. A sudden knock at the door broke the monotony, he quickly turned in his chair and began to stand, but when the door creaked open, he sat back down. In limped his wife, mangled and decaying. Clumps of her hair dangled from the side of her bloodied head. Her arms twisted in odd angles at the elbows, and one of her legs was smashed flat, being dragged as she moved forward. The misty pupil-less orbs in her scabbed head rolled as if trying to see. Tears erupted from his eyes and screams exploded from his mouth. The world reeled, he turned to the keyboard, nearing falling from his chair and began to type with trembling hands, \"My wife, Trisha Henry, dead.\" Still shaking terribly, he peered over his shoulder to find she was gone. The only remnants of her horrible revival was the stench of soil lingering in the air.",
        "The biggest challenge with owning any individual stock is price fluctuation, which is called risk. The scenarios you describe assume that the stock behaves exactly as you predict (price/portfolio doubles) and you need to consider risk. One way to measure risk in a stock or in a portfolio is Sharpe Ratio (risk adjusted return), or the related Sortino ratio. One piece of advice that is often offered to individual investors is to diversify, and the stated reason for diversification is to reduce risk. But that is not telling the whole story. When you are able to identify stocks that are not price correlated, you can construct a portfolio that reduces risk. You are trying to avoid 10% tax on the stock grant (25%-15%), but need to accept significant risk to avoid the 10% differential tax ($1000). An alternative to a single stock is to invest in an ETF (much lower risk), which you can buy and hold for a long time, and the price/growth of an ETF (ex. SPY) can be charted versus your stock to visualize the difference in growth/fluctuation. Look up the beta (volatility) of your stock compared to SPY (for example, IBM). Compare the beta of IBM and TSLA and note that you may accept higher volatility when you invest in a stock like Tesla over IBM. What is the beta of your stock? And how willing are you to accept that risk? When you can identify stocks that move in opposite directions, and mix your portfolio (look up beta balanced portolio), you can smooth out the variability (reduce the risk), although you may reduce your absolute return. This cannot be done with a single stock, but if you have more money to invest you could compose the rest of your portfolio to balance the risk for this stock grant, keep the grant shares, and still effectively manage risk. Some years ago I had accumulated over 10,000 shares (grants, options) in a company where I worked. During the time I worked there, their price varied between $30/share and < $1/share. I was able to liquidate at $3/share.",
        "In mathematics, a real number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity such as a distance, duration or temperature. Here, continuous means that values can have arbitrarily small variations.[a] Every real number can be almost uniquely represented by an infinite decimal expansion.[b]\nThe real numbers are fundamental in calculus (and more generally in all mathematics), in particular by their role in the classical definitions of limits, continuity and derivatives.[c]\nThe set of real numbers is denoted R or \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n\n and is sometimes called \"the reals\".\nThe adjective real in this context was introduced in the 17th century by René Descartes to distinguish real numbers, associated with physical reality, from imaginary numbers (such as the square roots of −1), which seemed like a theoretical contrivance unrelated to physical reality.\nThe real numbers include the rational numbers, such as the integer −5 and the fraction 4 / 3. The rest of the real numbers are called irrational numbers, and include algebraic numbers (such as the square root √2 = 1.414...) and transcendental numbers (such as π = 3.1415...).\nReal numbers can be thought of as all points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.\nConversely, analytic geometry is the association of points on lines (especially axis lines) to real numbers such that geometric displacements are proportional to differences between corresponding numbers.\nThe informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient for ensuring the correctness of proofs of theorems involving real numbers. The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field.[d] Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations. All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent.",

We serve the country better if we make room for all the talent.\" A Labour source told the Sunday Times Mr Campbell would \"effectively front\" the election media campaign but said he would be given no formal title.Labour strategists told the paper he would be \"set loose\" on Conservative leader Michael Howard in attacking his party's economic record when it was in power. \"They used pictures from the 1970s in the 1992 campaign to remind people of the winter of discontent - and now it's our turn,\" the source told the paper. \"Making Michael Howard leader gives us an unmissable opportunity to remind people what it was like to pay mortgage rates of 15% even if it was more than a decade ago.\" Mr Campbell was at the centre of the government's row with BBC over Andrew Gilligan's story about the Iraq weapons dossier. The Hutton inquiry cleared him of \"sexing up\" the dossier in the run-up to the Iraq war. Since leaving Downing Street, he has toured the country with his one man show, An Audience With Alastair Campbell and presented a number of interview programmes for Channel 4.",

        "I'm not talking about whether one enjoys watching a particular sport or criticizes a sport on the grounds that \"I think it's boring to watch\"; I am talking about non-athletes \"sports-fans\" who criticize sports or athletes on the grounds of \"people who participate in x-sport are inferiorsuperior to people who play y-sport, or it is harder to be a professional x-sport player than a professional y-sport player.\" I am not talking about the tangibles but the intangibles, presented as objective facts about a sport. Varsity high-school sports (or equivalent depending on local) is the bare-minimum level one can be at before they are allowed any sort of opinion about such matters, yet it seems to me that the only people who actually have such opinions have never been capable of reaching such a level themselves. Rarely do you see actual athletes getting into arguments about what sports have the best athletes or which sports are \"better\" or \"harder.\" Anyone who has actually gotten to a level where the competition is even moderately high understands the work that goes into a sport, no matter the sport, and usually respects fellow athletes for their dedication and work they put in to be good at their sport of choice, and if you never had the drive or weren't good enough to make the cut for even high school varsity your \"opinion\" is meaningless. The reason I want a CMV is because I think poorly of non-athletes who criticize sportsathletes on the basis of what sport they play. In order to change my view one will need to make a convincing argument that non-athletes have grounds to criticize actual athletes on the basis of what sport they play discover up with some objective grounds for determining which sports are \"best.\" Edited for clarity.

The intro is different, the bass is pumped up, the song is longer, certain sections are extended, others are shortened. It required some amount of input before it became what it was. It might be very similar, but it's not so similar that you can say there was no skill or creative effort involved. And [here's] a Nightcore mix. It's the exact same fucking thing! Just sped up!

        "I had an AMAZING experience here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone! I made reservations for 7:45 and arrived around 8:00 due to Strip traffic. The host joked around about me being late (which I appreciated), but was able to seat me within five minutes despite the long line at the hostess desk! The person who escorted us to our table was warm, welcoming, and hilarious to talk to! When making our reservation, we were advised that it would be for inside the restaurant and that outside seating would be first-come, first-serve (about a 90 minute wait at that time). However, we were seated on a deck area that was between the indoor seating and balcony seating. We LOVED this area because we still had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains without the wait (nor the drunks roaming the Strip). As for the food, I had the filet mignon merlot, as well as escargot, sauteed mushrooms, and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. The filet was SCRUMPTIOUS! One of the best filets I've ever had and reasonably priced. It was so tender and flavorful, and I loved the merlot sauce! It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. Additionally, the frites were delicious (albeit salty), especially when you dipped it in the merlot sauce. I would not recommend the sauteed mushrooms, and the escargot was just mediocre. I was surprised they did not provide toast or pastry puffs with the escargot, but they did serve complimentary bread so it worked out. The service at Mon Ami Gabi was great! Everyone was extremely friendly and comfortable cracking jokes - which I liked. However, they were also efficient and accurate, which is equally important. The view of the Bellagio fountains was the cherry on top! The restaurant was not too noisy, especially compared to Sugar Factory. If you are looking for a high-quality restaurant (especially a steakhouse) with a view of the Bellagio fountains, but cannot afford Bellagio's high-end restaurants, Mon Ami Gabi is the perfect place! I will definitely return!",
        "I don't think I can live without you.... You, and the way you smell and how your scent hangs in the air even after you've gone. You, and the taste you leave in my mouth, the way I still need you even after you've burned me once, twice, ten times. You're the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning; you're the only thing that gets me out of bed. You make my heart race, and I hate when I can't have you. I never feel awake until I've gotten my fix of you. More often than not though, you and what you do to me keep me up long after I should be sound asleep; our meetings mustn't run so late but I think I am addicted to you and I cant help caving into my cravings to taste you. You, and the way you warm my body and how at other times, when I need it, you cool me down. There's just something about you that keeps me coming back to you again and again. You're rarely the same and I love all sides of you, can't get enough of you. You keep things exciting but you're still always there waiting for me. I love how we can sit, quiet in the mornings but for the birds chirping and you touch my lips and every time is like the first time. I love how we can sit, to catch up together with old friends, how you still affect me from the inside out as if I could ever ignore you. I am jealous when I see you with others instead of me; don't you know how much I adore you, love you, need you? Don't you realize what you've done to me? You've intertwined yourself so deep in my everyday that to be without you would be blasphemy. There's no other way to explain it. Is this really as one-sided as you make it seem sometimes though? I'm always the one putting in the effort to make this work, to make you give me what I so desperately want and need from you. You must think I am crazy saying all of this but you must know it's you who's done this to me. It's you who I will never have enough of. It's you who I don't think I can live without..",
        "Aurelie looked out of the window onto the sprawling mess of metal trees that was the city. Such serenity for a Monday. Her tea was the perfect temperature to sip, and the rain came down softly onto the tops of the skyscrapers, where the filters gurgled to pump the water through the pipes. The cashmere of her sweater enveloped her as she became lost in thought. The legislation to deregulate business using the labor from below was coming along nicely. Today they were going to pass some new bills for bathroom breaks. Silly how such a thing could have an impact on worker productivity. Not nearly as important as minimum wage, which was a bigger battle. She didn't notice Pollux's soft hand on her shoulder until it came up to stroke her cheek. \" It's time. You're needed, \" he said, giving her a gentle kiss. \" Good luck. \" \" Of course I am. \" Her high heels clacked on the marble floor. She quickly applied some lipstick in the mirror of the foyer. Now she was the perfect chairwoman. At peace. Contained. Whole. She stepped out of her door and into chaos. Men and women were rushing every which way, whispering in an urgent panic. She took the elevator up and inquired what was going on. \" They're coming, \" said her secretary. \" The people from below. They're coming up. \" Aurelie laughed. \" Excellent. We'll have to invite them to have some coffee with us. \" \" No. Miss Stone, they're really coming up. Reports are coming in from all over the city. They're coming. Climbing up any way they can. They've started on the Renaissance Tower. \" \" We'll have to deal with this ourselves. \" What a terrible Monday. She got in the elevator and put in her radio headpiece. \" The city's lower-class citizens are seeking refuge on the upper floors of our towers. They claim to be fleeing an unknown group of classist terrorists who are calling for anarchy. The military is attempting to put the riots down. More reports to follow. \" This could be very bad. She stepped out onto the carpeted lobby floor and observed the carnage from the massive windows. People in rags were using every means possible to flee upwards. A few had attached, spider-like, with grappling hooks to the bottom of the Committee Building. Get on the PA, Aurelie. ATTENTION. THE COMMITTEE BUILDING IS ON TOTAL LOCKDOWN.

        "\"Open.\" Click \"Close.\" Click \"Open.\" Click \"Close.\" Click Fraid paused. Click He stood in the vent room, watching the shutters open and close, filtering the outside air to make it suitable to breathe. The last filter was in the air duct and Fraid knew it was only a matter of time before it stopped working. The pollen was getting too thick and their manufacturing facility had already fallen. Time and nature, ready to play their trump card and send humanity out of existence. It was last month when the manufacturing plant was compromised. A single Hades vine managed to attach itself to the outside of the building. By then, it was too late. Once the vine attaches it begins to corrode the surface, infecting the material with its seeds while creating a suitable substrate for its offspring to thrive. It grows too quickly to combat and once the building was compromised, it is protocol to seal off the entrance to it. As a community, the last colony came to the understanding that the day they lost the plant, would be the day they gave up. The Hades vine was bad enough, corroding all that humanity ever built into soil, but there was also the Reaper Fir. The Reaper Fir lets out a pollen that attacks the body like mustard gas. The tiny granules blister and eat away at human skin; it ruptures vessels in the lungs until the victim suffocates on their own fluids. By now, the Earth was covered in the poisonous pollen. Click Fraid walked over to the sealed door in the vent room. On the keypad, he punched in his override code. In the background, he heard muted gunshots as the doors began to open. Click The shutters would remain open now, as the filter became saturated. People inside the complex chose poison, or guns for their ends, but Fraid wanted something different. He wanted to stare up at God as the last human on the surface of the Earth and ask for mercy. His first few steps began to itch his eyes. He closed them while his skin started to turn hot. He held his breath as the pollen stung his lungs. A few more steps and his feet met the dirt. They sunk in and the blisters began to swell. He fell to his knees. The burning became too much to stand. In his last effort, he opened his eyes to the sky and screamed, \"help us!\" but there was no reply. The pollen rushed into his lungs and the vessels burst. The last human, returned to the dirt.",
        "Last month he became the first player to speak publicly about being sexually abused as a boy at Crewe in the 1980s. There are now 155 suspects in the UK-wide football child abuse scandal. Woodward said he gave police further information five weeks ago, but has \"still not provided statements despite my continual requests to do so.\" On Twitter he wrote: \"People should know I suffered more than one abuser. \"I've now been waiting five weeks to provide my statement with the police, for further abuse on me. \"I've not mentioned it before now but it hurts. I need to let go of that pain, yet still waiting.\" He later told BBC Sport that police had now said they would visit him next week - but called the delay \"shocking.\" Police say there are now 429 potential victims linked to football, some as young as four at the time of the alleged offence, and 148 clubs are now involved. Woodward, who is also a former police officer, has launched an independent trust to help other abuse victims \"fight for justice.\" The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) set up Operation Hydrant to oversee investigations of \"non-recent\" child sex abuse within institutions or by people of public prominence. The spotlight has fallen on abuse in football since a a number of former footballers came forward publicly to tell their stories, and the number of suspects has almost doubled in a fortnight. In a statement on Wednesday, Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the NPCC lead on child abuse, said allegations received by police across the country \"were being swiftly acted upon,\" but acknowledged that a \"higher than usual\" volume of calls was causing delays. The latest figures from the NPCC, released on Wednesday, show there have been 819 referrals from police forces and a special helpline set up for victims of abuse in football. Chief Constable Bailey, said: \"The numbers keep growing. We are dealing with some of the most complex investigations you can imagine. \"We are dealing with incredibly sensitive matters, sometimes in very high profile cases and of course all those factors create a huge challenge for the service.\" The official overall Operation Hydrant statistics show there were 3,469 suspects of historical child abuse under investigation as of December 2016. This compares with 1,433 in May 2015. Among the overall statistics for child sex abuse there are 366 people of public prominence - including 162 from TV, film or radio - under investigation. There were 3,531 people classed as victims, of which 2,604 (74) were male and 899 (25) were female. A further 28 victims were of unknown sex. In November 2016 there were 26 sports institutions under investigation. That figure has since increased to 74. Mr Bailey urged victims of child sexual abuse to report it by dialling 101 or contacting the dedicated NSPCC helpline for those abused in football, \"regardless of how long ago the abuse may have taken place.\"",
        "My credentials : Ph.D. in Psychology with a concentration in Cognitive Neuroscience . Research experience : fMRI , psychophysical , and genetic research into the human visual , auditory , attentional and memory systems . The ' thought voice in your head ' , as with all of your thoughts , originates in your brain . The human brain is the single most complex object in the known universe , and it has large networks of neurons devoted to sound perception and production , among many other things . The human auditory system is capable of ' replaying ' sound memories , which is what happens whenever you think of any sound you 've heard , including when you \" say \" something in your head . More specifically , we have separable mechanisms for planning speech ( stringing together sounds to say ) and producing speech ( actually moving the muscles ) , and we can \" plan \" speech in our heads without actually producing the speech . So , when you see these squiggly symbols we call letters in the patterns we call words and sentences , your brain analyzes them , recognizes them , and then you can replay the sounds of those words in your head that you 've heard before . Commonly , when people use an inner voice to think , they think in the voice that they remember themselves using previously . If you 're not sure , read this sentence out loud then read it in your head ; do those sound similar ? To answer your second question , your memories of your own voice are slightly altered from what everyone else hears because your vocal tract and ears share a head . Physically , sounds are vibrations , and when you generate vibrations in the air using your vocal tract , some of those vibrations are also transmitted through your head . Other people only hear the air vibrations . That 's why your voice sounds a bit off when you hear a recording of it . As for the third question , you do n't have to think in \" your \" voice as you 've heard it before when you speak , but many people do . As an example , try reading this sentence in your head normally , then read it in your head as if you 've just sucked in some helium from a balloon or with your favorite accent . Also , as an aside , I should point out that you do n't have to \" say \" words in your head when you read . Some people only \" see \" the words and do n't go the extra step of pronouncing things . Personally , I read by \" saying \" things in my head , which I suspect is because that is how I was taught to read . That makes it hard for me to imagine reading without \" hearing \" the voice in my head , but it happens .",
        "this is the short version 1 . a bunch of people say they want to be president 2 . alot of presidential speeches take place stating why they deserve a chance . 3 . serious contenders with enough support take part in debates hosted by news channels to be asked questions regarding their stances and opinions about the country and abroad . 4 . caucuses are held to decide the main candidates for the political parties involved . 5 . primary elections begin to narrow the candidates down to only two , a democrat and republican(or another but unlikely political party as of date ) 6 . in november the final election between the two take place . negative aspects : regarding the voting itself the voting process is commonly described as unfair or corrupt to most(though the complaints are usually done by the losing voters ) . what happens during the voting process in November is that the masses votes go to their suggestion of the wanted president . the reason why its referred to as \" suggested \" by me is that the votes do n't directly go towards the candidate . ready to get worried ? we are not electing the president , we are electing OTHER PEOPLE to vote for him . and in ~24 states these people ( retired politicians mostly ) can vote for whomever they want regardless of what their represented voters demand become our president . so basically you tell a random man in a suit to vote for your president and he gets to vote for the president he wants regardless of what you really wanted . This is how some of our presidents got elected without needing an actual majority vote from the general populace . this may have some bias in it but that 's up for debate * as well * pun not originally intended I 'm guessing you may also want an explanation of electoral college ? ? short version : this results in single votes in one state be worth more than single votes in another state . which inequalizes the power of 1person=1vote to 1person=2 - 3votes in comparison between states . and one last thing : us americans do n't really have the right to vote at all , it was never a written right for us and the founders of america designed it to originally only allow the government itself to elect its own leadership . My best guess beyond this point is that they did this because they did not want presidential candidates trying to influence public opinion to pressure the government into giving him presidency fearing severely misinformed public disapproval . why prevent them from influencing public to such degree ? because they knew even back then that public masses can be easy to influence .",
        "Hard work for hard work's sake: There seems to be a prevalent and reinforced myth that this is a good thing and that earning your living by the sweat of your brow is somehow virtuous. I disagree. I think myths about the virtue of a hard day's work are a useful to make the under-classed and working classes take pride in their bondage. (As an aside, Twitter hashtags like riseandgrind only show that in this age of technological advancement, there is still a stubborn and obsolete blue-collar pride-in-drudgery which refuses to die off). My larger problem is that historical trends toward full automation and the widespread use of labour-saving devices show that we don't need to and truly don't want to be working hard when we can instead work smart or not at all. I would further posit that this sense of pride actually comes from a place of fear; people sub-consciously recoil in terror from the thought that they might have wasted all or part of their lives working obsolete, socially pointless, technologically irrelevant jobs, and so their mind, as a coping mechanism, formulates this myth which allows them to blithely keep working only vaguely aware that they are complicit in stymieing the progress of the species. CMV PROVE TO ME THAT THERE IS VIRTUE IN HARD WORK. NOTE: Im talking about all hard work. I dont want to hear a comparative analysis of why home-builders do more virtuous work than lever-pullers. I am talking about all work that can be outsourced to machines or automated processses or otherwise streamlined in efficiency. NOTE2: Also, lets try and avoid personal attacks against me; I dont hate my fellow man, I have nothing against workers and I am not an elitist by any means. I am the child of immigrants who worked their asses off and I have done my own share of menial labour in my life. NOTE3: I am not saying intellectual work is better than physical work. Hands-on tinkering an learning is just as important as mental exercise. And even office jobs and more cognitive processes that can be outsourced to machines should be. I mean we hardly expect physicists to forego the use of calculators, right? We know they know how to add and subtract, let a computer take care of that while they work on larger order problems. Similarly, we now a carpenter can build a house, if a large-scale 3d printer can build one and allow the carpenter to work on passion projects, why not make that happen?",
        "OCBC Centre is a , 52-storey skyscraper in Singapore. serving as the current headquarters of OCBC Bank, the building was completed in 1976 and was the tallest building in the country, and South East Asia, at that time. There are two extensions, OCBC Centre South and OCBC Centre East. There is an Executive Club on one of the higher floors of the building. OCBC Centre East has food and beverage outlets.\n\nHistory \nOCBC Centre was the result of the second Sale of Sites of the Urban Renewal Department of the Housing and Development Board in 1968.  The building was designed by I. M. Pei & Partners (now Pei Cobb Freed & Partners) together with now defunct BEP Akitek (Pte) Singapore and started construction in 1975. Its construction period was only two years due to a three-tier system. The building was completed on 1 October 1976 and was Southeast Asia's tallest building at the time. A bronze sculpture designed by Tan Teng Kee sat at the building until 1983 when it was moved to the now defunct Bras Basah Park. Large Reclining Figure, a large bronze sculpture by Henry Moore, replaced it in 1984, and a new plaza and reflecting pool were built outside the front entrance of the building. The building has undergone several modernisations and OCBC Centre East and South was constructed at a later date.\n\nArchitecture\nThe building is an example of Brutalist architecture, a popular architectural style in the 1970s.\n\nIt is designed to be a symbol of strength and permanence, and its structure consists of two semi-circular reinforced concrete cores as well as three lateral girders which helped make construction faster. The building is divided into three sections due to the steel trusses being  constructed off-site and were put into position. Each section consists of floors that are cantilevered 6 metres from each column, with load transfer girders spanning at each end taking up boxed sections of the pre-stressed concrete. Lattice steel models strengthened by steel and  concrete compression was installed on the 20th and 35th floors of the building. The building has been nicknamed \"The Calculator\" due to its flat shape and windows which look like button pads.\n\nSee also \n List of tallest buildings in Singapore\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1976 establishments in Singapore\nBrutalist architecture in Singapore\nDowntown Core (Singapore)\nI.

        "Basically, this argument predicates on two things: 1. acceptance of self-defense as a valid reason for violence, which I think is a fair assumption of most if not all people here. 2. the legal system in question (for the sake of argument, let's stick to the American one) has moral or ethical failings I'll illustrate my point with an analogy: Let's say a Gestapo member stops a Jew who had recently robbed some cigars in Nazi Germany (let's say this is prior to the implementation of the Final Solution) for walking in the middle of the street. Maybe the Gestapo member is super nice. Maybe he even has some Jewish friends. Maybe he's just doing his damn job. Yea, walking in the street is illegal, and so is stealing cigars. But who, other than neo-Nazi scum, would say that the Jew would be wrong to punch the Gestapo? Sure, legally the Gestapo's in the right and the Jew is in the wrong. But the law itself and the society they're in has institutionalized a systemic form of discrimination against the Jew. The Jew would have no obligations whatsoever to respect the authority of the Gestapo. Yes, it might be dumb to punch the Gestapo- I won't deny that. The Gestapo will likely kill the Jew now. But was it morally wrong to hit someone who is enforcing a morally repugnant system? Of course not. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how legally justified the Gestapo's actions are, they're still trying to enforce a morally repugnant system that specifically targets the Jewish people. Therefore it's self defense. Unless you deny that American law and society are systematically discriminating against poor people and black people, the analogy holds. But even if you don't think that, insofar as American law and society are promoting any kind of injustice, then the analogy holds, because then cops become the ground-soldiers and enforcers of that injustice. Therefore, a cop who operates in an unjust framework is automatically waging war against you. Attacking him is morally justifiable as an act of self defense. Hello, users of CMV!

        "Maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.It would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.Ms Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"She said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.",
        "To start , of the 6 examples you gave , three are n't types of government , two are basically the same thing , and one is more of a class of government . But I shall press on . * * Types of government * * * Anarchy [ No government . Marxist communism falls here ] Pros : The pros are mostly ideological , individualism taken to it 's extreme . Cons- Nothing preventing any crime , impossible to organize more than 20 people toward a common goal * Direct Democracy [ Each citizen votes directly on every issue ] - Pros : Everyone gets a voice in the government , which keeps people happy . No leaders to screw over the common man for their own gain . Cons : Wildly impractical on any relevant scale ; people are stupid and might vote for stupid things , 51 % of the population can vote to screw over the other 49 % however they like . * Republicanism [ Citizens vote for representatives who then in turn vote on issues ] - Pros : More conservative , unlikely to take any radical action , Career politicians can make nuances decisions , people can still hold their representatives accountable . Cons : Career politicians get less accountable the longer they 're in office , often unresponsive to change , politics becomes massively convoluted thus requiring career politicians * Aristocracy / Oligarchy [ Small group of people in charge of everything ] - Pros : Politicians ( Aristocrats ) have deep personal interest in the land they rule over , politicians careers not in jeopardy over a single gaffe , politicians can focus on doing what they believe is best rather than what the people want , Politicians can be trained from birth for their job . Cons : Unavoidable and unalterable class system , Aristocrats can do whatever they want to the lower classes , aristocrats generally do n't care about the workers , inevitable and purposeful wealth inequality * Dictatorship [ One person in charge of everything ] - Dictator deep personal interest in the land they rule over , dictator can focus on doing what they believe is best rather than what the people want , Dictator can be trained from birth for their job .

        "First Impressions: Classy, classy, classy! Scarpetta is located on the 3rd floor in the Cosmo and everything about this restaurant screams class. My reservation for Scarpetta was for 112014 at 7:30 pm. The actual reservation was made about a week prior and I had put in a request to be seated with a view of the Bellagio fountain show. Upon arrival, the hostess said they had tried their best to accommodate my request but that we would be seated one row away from the window view of the fountains. Nevertheless, I appreciate the honesty and their earnest efforts. The service was impeccable and up to the standards of a Scott Conant restaurant. My bf and I were seated and presented with the menus immediately. Our waters were filled and a wine menu was brought to the table. My bf decided to order the duck and foie gras ravioli with marsala reduction (27) and I ordered the endive and apple salad with heirloom beets, gorgonzola cheese and candied walnuts (17). Once our orders were placed, the breadbasket was brought out. I truly appreciated the attention placed into informing the patrons on the different types of breads and dips. It was helpful because now I knew exactly what types of gourmet breads we would be feasting on! From what I can recall, I remember a small ciabatta, a piece of foccacia, and two breads with mozzarella and salami baked in. The breads were warm, and enclosed in a cloth napkin with another piece of traditional Italian bread placed atop it. The bread basket was divine and each piece of bread paired nicely with the soft, spreadable butter, salty eggplant spread and the citrus-infused olive oil dip. As a matter of fact, the bread was so good that I asked the server for another basket and that was brought outonly to be devoured again! As for the entrees, the presentation was extremely beautiful for both dishes. The foie gras was plated on the plate with the marsala reduction drizzled beautifully over the top. The ravioli was plentiful and this surprised my bf since he was only expecting a handful of ravioli. My endive and beet salad was truly one of the most beautiful salads I've ever seen. The endives were sliced thinly and the bitter after taste of the endives paired quite nicely with the sweetness of the beets, apples and candied walnuts while the salty gorgonzola cheese bits added the necessary salty punch to the sweet and bitter. The ambience was romantic, dim and quiet. My bf and I really enjoyed dinner that night. The overall price may not be cheap but for the quality of the food, it was well justified. Bottom line: I would return for that breadbasket alone!",
        "College baseball player Christopher Lane, 22, was shot in the back in the town of Duncan on Friday. Police said one of the accused admitted Lane was killed for \"the fun of it.\" Chancey Luna, 16, and James Edwards, 15, were charged with first-degree murder; Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, has been named as accessory to the crime. Lane, from Melbourne, had been visiting his girlfriend's family in Duncan. He was entering his final year at East Central University in the city of Ada, some 85 miles (137km) east of the town. Because of the severity of their alleged crime, all three of the accused will be tried in adult court. At Tuesday's hearing, Michael Dewayne Jones cried after he tried to speak about the incident but was cut short by the judge, who said the facts of the case would be determined at another hearing. Bail for him was set at 1m (PS640,000). The two younger accused were denied bail. Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford told local television on Monday that one suspect had said Lane was killed at random. \"They saw Christopher go by, and one of them said,'there's our target, Chief Ford said. \"The boy who has talked to us said,'we were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody. Mr Ford said they followed Lane in a car and shot him once in the back before driving off. Witnesses rushed to help Lane after seeing him collapse on the road in Duncan, which has about 24,000 residents. Family and friends in the US and Australia have been mourning him. His American girlfriend, Sarah Harper, wept as she laid a cross by a memorial in Duncan at the spot where he was shot. Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper reported that roses and a baseball were placed on the home plate where Lane played baseball as a boy in a suburb of the city. It was accompanied by a message that read: \"A wonderful young man taken too soon. Why?\" The victim's father, Peter Lane, said there was no explanation for his son's death. \"It is heartless and to try to understand it is a short way to insanity,\" he told Australia's Sky News. The mother of one of the accused was quoted by Australian broadcaster ABC News as saying that she could not believe her son was at fault. \"I get off work at three,\" she said. \"It takes me five minutes to get home and he was there. That's what time they said it happened.\"",
        "So I just watched this Last Week Tonight segment: It was entertaining, and while I agreed with a lot of it, what really pissed me off was the whole \"interviewing people on the street\" thing and the whole rabble about how \"the average person doesn't know or care.\" Fact of the matter is, most of us \"average people\" are specialists. We know an awful lot about a small segment of the world. I know about issues like net neutrality and government surveillance and dumb stuff like Sakawa because I hang around in those circles. But if you asked me about just about anything else, I'd give some vague or hilariously misinformed response. Conflict in the Middle East? \"Yeah, that's been going on forever and'll never get resolved. People fighting over the Gaza Strip or something, idk.\" Gay rights? \"Social progress is being made. I'm sure we'll all have equality soon enough. Uganda has some horrific laws.\" I'm exaggerating, but you get the idea. Or stuff like this: Of course, to me it seems crazy to not know what a web browser is, but really, expecting the average person on the street to tell you what a web browser is an unreasonable expectation, the same way I dunno anything about my car engine or about plumbing aside from how to use a plunger. Instead, what we expect is that everyone specializes in some stuff and those specialists take care of that stuff for us. The computer engineer writes the software for the plumber, and the plumber fixes the computer engineer's pipes. The most obvious counterargument that comes to mind is \"policy is about what government can do to everyone, as citizens. As citizens, we all have an obligation to know about how policy affects us.\" But I don't think that's valid because there's just FAR, FAR too much policy for any person to know about. People just have to pick and choose the few issues they care most about. And statistically, the chances of two people who care about the same issues meeting at random are just really small.

        "Whether a country is overpopulated depends on what you consider to be an acceptable standard of living - overpopulation is when the population is too high to attain that living standard. What standard you consider acceptable is probably greatly influenced by your own standard of living - if you consume 80,000 a year, 1,000 a year (including government benefits!) probably seems like an unacceptable consumption level. Obviously, 1,000 a year is much worse, but it's certainly possible for most people to live a long and not-terrible life with that little money, especially if everyone else is also that poor. If no country had a GDP per capita greater than 1,000, the richest country in the world probably wouldn't seem overpopulated. I think that people who see the poorest countries as overpopulated hellholes (even ignoring that their economies are likely to improve in the future) have an overly \"glass half empty\" view of the lives of their residents. For example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the poorest country in the world and recently had a huge civil war that killed more people than any war since World War II. Its life expectancy is around 50 years, one of the lowest in the world. Even so, you can make the case that its life expectancy is actually quite high! It's more than half of America's and Japan's life expectancies - the life expectancy glass is half full. More importantly, it's much higher than the life expectancy of the typical country in the past. The life expectancy of white American males in 1900 was only [about 48] , comparable to the DRC today, and England (a relatively rich country at the time) had a life expectancy in 1700 of only 37 (see The Population History of England, ). Many other areas at other times as life expectancies less than 30 years. The one clear standard for overpopulation that I can think of is population decline: if a country has death rates so high that its population can't grow (the country exceeded its \"carrying capacity, then it's unreasonable to say that it isn't overpopulated. By that standard, no country is overpopulated today; all the countries with shrinking populations have low fertility rates, not low life expectancies. In fact, by that standard, all countries are very far from overpopulation. Many countries in the past were able maintain roughly stable populations with life expectancies of around 30, so any contemporary country could suffer a 10-15 year drop in life expectancy and still maintain its population level! tl;dr: Overpopulation is subjective, and my own standard is \"exceeding the carrying capacity.\" By that standard, no country is overpopulated or even close, since all countries today have very high life expectancies compared to typical countries from 1-1700 AD. The best way to change my view would be to come up with a different (higher) standard for overpopulation.",
        "Contract killings have been my specialty for some time now. There's just something about the subtlety of executing without being seen, the unique challenge that accompanies each target. Yes yes, some are quite simple: a dab of poison here or an arrow shot from a secluded location, but every so often, a challenge arises that requires specific skills and, best yet, has no deadline. My magnum opus began in the Spring of 1900 with the usual beckoning, a crate on my stoop filled with, what would appear to the common eye, apples. I dug through the top layer and about half way down finally found the payment- layers upon layers of gold, much more than usual. As I counted the gold bricks, my mind wandered..... Who could want someone dead this badly? Was it a scorned lover? An petulant child seeking an early inheritance? My question would never be answered, but the target would be..... I was to assassinate the King. Now, most assassins would scoff at this task. Rate of success is practically non-existent and the risk of failure is certain death. I was, however, not a normal assassin have never turned down task. I set to work, mining information on his daily routine. I snuck into the castle under the guise as a servant and it quickly became apparent just how difficult this task would be. The king has all of his food taste tested before hand, and he has a personal guard even when he shits. No, this task requires more thought, more cunning and much more subtlety that any of my priors. The only weakness I could find was his habit of bedding his servants female family members. It was here that I struck. Finding a concubine is not too difficult, the challenging part if sprucing one to the king's standards. I took Mary in off the streets, provided her with food, drink, and clothing. She knew the basics of what was in store and she relished the thought of being \"loved\" by the king, if only for one night, and it helped my plight in that she was easy on the eyes. After a few days of grooming and teaching decorum, I shipped Mary to the king under the guise of winning favor. He took Mary in without hesitation. One night, I told myself, the King's sword, his own prick, will be his undoing. Mary emerged the next day chipper than ever. She was given her sum in gold and eventually moved to America of all places. As for myself, the job was finished. Sure, the bastard may not be dead yet, but he soon will be. One year later, the queen -God bless her soul- passed and the king followed 9 years later. The tabloids declared the death complications from an ulcer, but I knew the truth. Not many escape the wrath of typhoid fever.",
        "Mods: I realise libertarianism is a common topic here, but I think my view is a sufficiently original one. Libertarianism is the One Weird Trick For Solving Any Issue, Politicians HATE Us! of politics. It reduces many of the most complex problems in the world to a set of answers concise enough that they can fit on the back of a business card (isolationism, tiny government, bare minimal taxation). There are quite a few CMVs here from people arguing about the effectiveness of libertarian solutions in the real world, but I want to go further. I believe that most libertarians simply do not care about the real world of the effects their intended policies would have. Rather, the primary goal of most libertarians is to feel like they have the 'correct' answer, and the primary draw of libertarianism is that it provides a singularly simple way to get this feeling. I have honestly yet to see a proposed policy solution from a libertarian which addresses the complexities of the real world, only a stream of restatements of the core beliefs. All healthcare and entitlement debates are reduced to \"taxation is theft,\" all defense and national security debates are reduced to \"withdraw and isolate,\" and all economic debates are reduced to \"deregulate,\" with no sense of reality or nuance. When libertarians defend this with \"well of course I don't have a developed policy, because the government shouldn't have any policy on the topic\" it's invariably followed up by the nebulous phrase \"market solutions\" (often backed up by a misinterpretation of the First Welfare Theorem), with zero information on how these markets would actually develop in the real world. Ultimately, every libertarian I've ever met has been marked by the same lack of humility (I've never heard a libertarian say \"I don't know the answer and oversimplification, leading me to the view that their primary goal is to feel correct and \"win\" debates, rather than a genuine attempt to engineer real world solutions of any kind.

        "His eyes watering. He knew it was about to happen again. He fought it, but the chances were slim that he could hold on much longer. Blink. A swirling sensation overcame his cranium, allowing him to feel nothing but dread. Even though it happened in an instant, it felt like hours each time. Jeff returned from the blink, hoping for some end to the hell that had befallen him. Something felt different about this trip. He woke up in his own bed. The comfy high thread count sheets curled around his mid-waist like wisp of warm summer air. A smile fell across his face. This was not the usual reaction to the very unusual change in circumstances he was continually. In walked the most beautiful woman he had ever laid his eyes upon. Her hair blonde, curly like that of your typical southern belle but with an undeniable hint of strength. And \" god those eyes \" he thought to himself. It seemed cliche when the thought popped into his head, but he couldn't help thinking that they looked like blue diamonds. As if she had done it a thousand times, she smiled at him. The smile was so pleasant that Jeff felt like he knew this woman. She definitely knew him. As she came closer, she whispered tenderly, \" Is something wrong baby. \" He didn't know what to say. Then the thought hit him. He'd be leaving this scenario just as abruptly as he fell into it. And for reasons beyond his grasp, he was already in love with this woman. Then it hit him: this was his life. He had been cycling so long that he had forgotten his true reality. The endless torture he had endured had finally brought him back to where it all began, but the apprehension didn't leave. He choked back, \" Nothing Jenny. Nothing. Come here. \" \" Oh shit, he thought. \" He could feel his eyes watering. He had learned to fight it longer and longer each time, but this time was coming quicker than the latter. She got closer to him, kneeling on the bed. In she leaned for the kiss, his eyelids now quivering. As supple, juicy lips touched his, he couldn't hold on any longer. Jeff's eyelids slammed together and his shook with fury. During the transition he made up his mind: suicide was the only option. Slowly, they came back open. But the warm, soft sensation on his lips was still there. And to his wondrous surprise, so was his was beautiful. He embraced her like it would be his last, but he knew it wouldn't. \" Nothing, nothing at all. \"",
        "Autopharmacology relates to the scientific study of the regulation of body functions by the activity of its naturally existent (or endogenous) chemical factors of the tissues. A more restricted definition would consider substances that were first identified as external agents which had a documented action on physiological functions, but later were discovered as existing as endogenous factors. The best example is the class of endorphins, which, as its name implies, were discovered to exist in the brain and have specific receptors in it, by investigations on the mechanism of action of opioids, such as morphine.\n\nHistorically, the first approach to the concept of autopharmacology began with British physiologist and pharmacologist Henry Dale in the 1910s, discovered the role of acetylcholine in synaptic transmission, and later proved by Austrian physiologist Otto Loewi, to be the neurotransmitter involved in the proximal synapses of the autonomic nervous system (initially named Vagusstoff by Loewi, and later identified as acetylcholine). The same happened to another autonomic neurotransmitter, noradrenaline (Akzeleransstoff by Loewi), which later proved to be chemically similar to a long used pharmacological agent, adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. Both scientists were awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their pioneering and important contributions.\n\nA research area where autopharmacology principles assumed great importance was that of pain and inflammation, due to the great number of endogenous messengers, transmitters and modulators involved in their complex response at molecular and cellular level. The control and regulation mechanisms of the circulatory system and renal functions and their interactions (such as the renin/angiotensin system) are also greatly influenced by autopharmacological agents; One of the autopharmacology pioneers was Professor Mauricio Rocha e Silva, leader of the team of Brazilian researchers who discovered bradykinin in 1948, an endogenous substance involved in hypotension in circulatory shock. Of course, all these systems are of extreme importance for clinical practice and for the discovery of new therapeutic drugs.\n\nEndogenous substances that could fall under the concept of autopharmacology are:\n\n Endorphins\n Dynorphin\n Bradykinin\n Prostaglandins\n Angiotensin\n Secretin\n Gastrin\n Cholecystokinin\n Histamine\n Cannabinoids\n Substance P\n\nThe main scientific criterion for an autopharmacological agent is the discovery of specific membrane receptors for it and, hopefully, its transduction and cell signaling mechanisms.\n\nThe term was never much of a mainstream concept, and has fallen into disuse, as research on basic mechanisms has advanced. In a recent literature search on PubMed, only six titles refer to the term autopharmacology.\n\nReferences\n\nPharmacology\nPhysiology",
        "In a time when the constitution and principals the United States were founded on are trampled underfoot by an administration desperate to distract attention from its own internal problems, where the Geneva Convention, human rights and foreign sovereignty are unapologetically discarded, a thriller about the state taking illegal action that far exceeds that of the terrorists they are countering might seem appropriate. However, if you want to see a film about that, try Ed Zwick's flawed THE SIEGE instead, because NADA is one of the most infantile 'political' thrillers ever made. Like Robert Altman's PRET-A-PORTER, the director has taken on a subject he seems completely ignorant of, and imprints his ignorance on almost every frame.<br /><br />His terrorists are a wildly unconvincing group of stereotypes - Fabio Testi dresses as if he were auditioning for MAD Magazine's 'Spy vs. Spy' strip, Michel Duchaussoy behaves like an absurd KIDS IN THE HALL send up of the sociology professor from Hell, Mariangela Melato a cardboard middle-class revolutionary wannabe - who behave at every unconvincing plot turn as if they want to be caught. The corrupt authorities fare a little better, but are still painted in unconvincingly broad strokes.<br /><br />It is possible to make a smart film about dumb people (cf ELECTION), but this is a moronic film about dumb people made by people who think they're intellectuals who are talking down to the masses. In truth, were one to recast Testi, Duchaussoy and Melato with Jim Varney, Johnny Knoxville and Shannon Tweed, the result would actually be to raise the intellectual content of the film, not lower it.<br /><br />Chabrol might just have got away with his characters and events if he took them seriously, but his staging is so inept (the fight scenes would embarrass a kindergarten class while the shooting of the kidnapping is more inept than the kidnapping itself) and his inability to get his cast to perform with at least some approximation of recognisable human behaviour so blatant that it is actually embarrassing to watch (special mention must be made here of Duchaussoy: so very good in Chabrol's QUE LA BETE MUERE, he is stunningly bad here in a performance that is so far over the top it's back again).<br /><br />Chabrol has made some fine films, but you would never guess it from this amateurish mess - a newcomer to his work would never want to see another of his films after this, which would be a great shame. Utter drivel, and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material. One star out of ten - and that's being very generous.",
        "As someone who has seen and followed Hartley's public work for several years I think much of what used to be fiction told through true stories has been elevated into obscure philosophical mind games.<br /><br />While entertaining, Fay Grim is another step in the Henry Fool line of thinking, where the movie reflects the quality of an object within the movie itself. In Henry Fool, the object is the memoirs... In Fay Grim, the object is encrypted memoirs - which are themselves stolen, forged and trans-mutated into something so obscure it can't really make any sense - i.e. the process of script writing and film-making in the modern era - where most blockbuster films are little more than a mash-up of the past. That is, in a philosophical sense, what Fay Grim is all about. The object, perhaps, is the tragedy that shock is now cliché and dull (as hinted in the opening scenes at the publishers office).<br /><br />That being said, many of the movie best points are lost if you do not understand Henry's character and the significance of the memoirs being looked for. Henry is a thinly veiled devil, first visiting Simon as a modern Faust, etc. Without understanding how tragic Henry's character is, much of the quality of Fay Grim's plot and story is lost.<br /><br />And there is not enough 'detail' expressed through verbal flashbacks - knowing the plot of Henry Fool cannot compare to 'feeling' the quality of the characters as one did in Henry Fool, and so I think for someone who walks into this movie cold there is about 10 minutes of 'so what' responses to highly constructed dialog and then that's it.<br /><br />However, Henry Fool was also my least favorite Hartley film until I realized that it was bad - putrid and infested - precisely because Henry Fool's confessions were bad... not just raunchy or dirty, but inescapably broken. Henry can not even be a proper villain - and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes him most endearing... like Gollum in Tolkien's works, Henry is pitiable.<br /><br />That doesn't come across in Fay Grim, although Henry's dialog is excellent. What does come across is that the entire movie is constructed as an encryption - a sort of molding of another plot around what ends up being yet another bad story to add to henry's confessions. It is an interesting twist, but one that can't really be digested without viewing the first film. Perhaps showing more of Henry earlier on would have been better than having the publisher describe the basic storyline of the first movie - although this plot is also not really what the first movie was about - unless perhaps one is a casual observer.<br /><br />Part of the encryption? Hard to say... a little disappointed at the sex gimmicks though. Cheesy.",

        "Because they are n't very efficient . Lets say we use modern construction techniques and fill a pyramid with ' rooms ' people would wanna live in . ( I make this assumption because making a tomb that big for just one person anymore is silly on the face of it ) So now we have a ' use ' for a pyramid . Lets say you are in a big city and you want to build an apartment complex or a house or something . So you buy up a city block , knock down the old square apartment building that had a foot print of 500 m by 500 m. Now you are gon na build your pyramid apartment in that spot . you decide you want the slope of the sides to be 45 degrees , which means the height of your building is at most 250 m tall , which is fine . Now you realize that the volume of your pyramid ( which represents the amount of space people can use ) is 20,833,333.33 m^3 . Which sounds like a lot untill it is compared to an equivalent 500x500x250 cube appartment which gets three times as much space with 62,500,000 m^3 . But wait it gets better . If you have a 6 foot tall person in a room with a 45 degree slope to one of the walls , there will be six feet of ' floor space ' away from the wall in which they can not stand without crouching . Given that the average room in an apartment is something like 12x12 that is approximately half of every room in every apartment which a slightly above averaged height person can not access . Doing some very bad math this implies that of the 20,833,333.33 m^3 of total ' apartment space ' in your building only a further fraction of that would be usable . You can solve this problem by making the walls ' steeper ' but even then that increases the instability of your building , and kinda ruins the whole ' pyramid ' vibe in the first place . So there you have it , rectangular faced buildings are more efficient both in absolute amount of space , and amount of usable space , and lets face it , if you are n't making your building out of giant rocks ( which further limits the amount of space ) It probably is n't going to make it hangout of that much longer ' long term ' anyway . ( fun fact ) the tallest building in the world is 829.8 m. If this were a pyramid with a 45 degree slope to its sides it would cover approximately 2.75 square kilometers with its base . This represents over 3 % of the total area of manhattan . Which if it were located in it would displace over 50k people .",
        "A real simple definition or analogy of present Value would be the \"Principal\" or \"Loan Amount\" being lent and the future value as being returning the Principal along with cost of borrowing The (1+i)^n is the interest you earn on present value The (i+i)^-n is the interest you pay on future value The first one is the FVIF or future value of a $1 The second one is the PVIF or present value of a $1 Both these interest factors assume interest is paid annually, if the interest payment is made more often within the payment year then interest factors look this way m is the frequency of interest payment, the higher this frequency the more of interest you pay or earn and you pay or earn the most interest when compounding occurs on each small fraction of time This entails here e is the Euler's e  Thus the interest factors turn to this The preceeding examples only considered a single repayment at future date. Now if you were obliged to make periodic loan repayments say in amount of $1 for n number of periods. Then the present value of all such periodic payment is the \"Principal\" or amount you borrowed. This is the sum of discounted periodic payments as  if we replace 1/1+i with x then this turns out to be geometric series of the form This simplifies to  replacing (1/1+i) for x we get which is the present value of periodic payment in amount of $1 The future value of periodic payments in amount of $1 can be arrived at multiplying the PVIFA by (1+i)^n giving Once again the interest is compounded per annum and for intra-year compounding you would have to at first find the annual effective yield AEY to use as the effect rate is the PVIFA and FVIFA calculation for continuous compounding All the calculation discussed thus far did not take inflation into consideration, if we were to adjust the amounts for a growth of g% then the present value of a $1 would be as follow Once again you would have to use AEY if compounding frequency of interest is intra-year Now assume that each loan repayment increases or decreases by an extra amount Q per period. To find the present value of series of payments P that increase or decrease per period by an amount Q we would do the following calculations Here and All of these calculations have been available in tadXL add-in for finance and incrementally being offered as JavaScript financial functions library tadJS.

        "Brian Yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore-fests, but the truth is that his films actually aren't bad at all. The Re-Animator sequels aren't as great as the original, but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned. Return of the Living Dead 3 is the best of the series; and Society isn't a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece. This thriller certainly isn't a masterpiece; but it shows Yuzna's eye for horror excellently, and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging. I'm really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didn't turn up until 1996, as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - it's running away from a tiger for the modern world. Dentistry doesn't frighten me, but surprisingly; I would appear to be in the minority. The plot follows perfectionist dentist Dr Feinstone. He has a nice house, a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want. However, his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife's affair with the pool cleaner. And his life isn't the only one; as it's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger...<br /><br />When it comes to scaring the audience, this movie really makes itself. However, credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme. The fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that I'm not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes! The film follows the standard man going insane plot outline, only with The Dentist you always get the impression that there's more to the film than what we're seeing. It isn't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this won't be winning any awards, the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot. The acting, while B-class, is actually quite impressive; with Corbin Bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge. I should thank Brian Yuzna for casting Ken Foree in the movie. The Dawn of the Dead star doesn't get enough work, and I really love seeing him in films. The rest of the cast doesn't massively impress, but all do their jobs well enough. Overall, The Dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies. The gore scenes are sure to please horror fans, and I don't hesitate to recommend this film.",
        "In his first spell he won the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations but the deal was not renewed after the 2014 World Cup. He later returned on a match-by-match deal, which ended in November after failure to reach the 2015 Nations Cup. \"It's a fresh start. We need the support of our fans, media and every Nigerian to return the team to where we truly belong,\" Keshi told BBC Sport. \"As a coach and former player I was also hurt that we failed to qualify for the last Nations Cup. I remain confident that this time around we will see an improvement, change in attitude and positive results \"To succeed we all need to come together as one because Nigeria belongs to us - this is not Stephen Keshi's team but our national team.\" BBC Sport understands that Keshi has been set several targets and that his contract will be terminated if he does not meet them. The 53-year-old was also required to sign a code of conduct and is expected to work with the Nigerian Football Federation technical committee. However, the NFF's technical committee boss Felix Anyansi-Agwu said: \"The NFF board is confident Stephen Keshi can take the Super Eagles to new heights. \"We want Nigerians to see this as a new beginning and to support the team and the NFF.\" Keshi, who also won the Nations Cup as a player with Nigeria in 1994, declined to comment on the contract details or the exit of his long-term assistant Daniel Amokachi. Former Nigeria striker Amokachi has left his role with immediate effect and been replaced by Salisu Yusuf. Yusuf, who led Kano Pillars to the Nigerian title in 2008, has previously worked as assistant to former Nigeria coach Samson Siasia at both senior and U20 levels. As caretaker coach, Keshi endured a turbulent 2014, in which he was sacked by the NFF and only reinstalled after intervention from Nigeria President Goodluck Jonathan. His last two home matches in Abuja and Akwa Ibom were marred by a negative reaction from the public and Keshi has pleaded for the home supporters to be positive during the 2017 Nations Cup qualifiers. The Super Eagles have been drawn in one of the toughest-looking groups, alongside seven-time champions Egypt, Tanzania and Chad. \"I understand we still have some disappointed people out there but our dedicated players deserve our encouragement and support,\" added Keshi. \"It doesn't matter where they play, these boys always give everything and we need to stand by them and the coaching crew. \"I remain confident that this time around we will see an improvement, change in attitude and positive results.\"",
        "Sion Davies, 25, died after falling off a balcony at Anthony Munkley's Caia Park estate flat in Wrexham last October. Footage of the attack was filmed on Mr Davies's phone and played to the jury at Mold Crown Court. Lee Roberts, 33, and 53-year-old Mr Munkley deny murder. His wife, Gwenythe Munkley, 55, denies helping her husband evade arrest. Mr Munkley admitted having a drug problem since the age of 12 and said he was \"addicted,\" but denied owing Mr Davies money. He said he had been dealing cannabis since February of last year, and his flat came to be known as \"The Shop,\" making around PS400 from about 30 customers a week. Mr Munkley said he had \"absolutely nothing\" to do with the murder, blaming it on \"a Geordie man.\" He said he left the flat while that man fought Mr Davies. He told the jury the man was bringing Mr Davies a PS20 bag of cannabis. He said that man wanted to buy a crossbow, and he got one from his bedroom and showed it to him before agreeing a price of PS60. Mr Munkley said he went to the bedroom to get the box for it, and when he returned he heard the twang of the crossbow and saw Mr Davies punch the man in the face. \"I decided to get out of there,\" he said. \"I just panicked. I did not want my wife coming home to that. I got my dogs and I ran.\" The court previously heard the victim was stabbed, shot with a crossbow and pushed, or fell, from three storeys up. Mr Munkley denied boasting about the attack in calls to witnesses the following day, and said he did not know Mr Davies had been stabbed or slashed and that he had no reason to be hostile towards him. Andrew Thomas, prosecuting, suggested Mr Munkley had invented \"the Geordie man,\" something the defendant denied. Mr Thomas said an extensive police investigation had not revealed his existence and Mr Munkley could not give a single clue who he was. Mr Munkley also denied a suggestion by Mr Thomas he was running out of cannabis and had no money to pay for it. He denied being scared of rival drug dealers in Wrexham and denied he got himself into debt and had his supplies cut off. He said he had been awaiting a supply of quality cannabis worth PS2,000 from Liverpool the following day, which he intended paying for with money buried in a field at the back of the flats. The trial continues.",
        "It pretty much boils down to debt and jobs . Houses cost a lot of money -- more than most people could ever afford to just save up and pay cash . So most of the time , somebody borrows all that money from a bank so they can live in the house and pays the bank every month over 30 years or so plus interest . The bank wants to be sure it 's going to get its money back , so they ask for a lot of paperwork from the person asking for a loan so they can prove they have a good job , make enough money , and are responsible enough to pay their bills on time and will take care of the house . But eventually , things started to fall apart . The bank you got a loan from did n't really want to wait 30 years to get their money back , so they sold your loan to somebody else . Your bill still has your bank 's logo on it , they still handle the paperwork , but your monthly payments are now going to somebody else . After a while , this meant that banks were n't as careful when lending money as they used to be -- if you ca n't make your house payments , it 's not their problem anymore . They make their money off of you in the beginning , and sell off the loan . You 're someone else 's problem now . So it gets easier and easier to get a mortgage . People go nuts , buying houses left and right . People start to make piles of money , selling a house they bought for $ 100,000 five years ago to somebody for $ 200,000 . And then they go buy another house and figure some new paint and a bit of yardwork will make them even more money . Heck ! Let 's buy two houses ! House prices keep going up up up up up . Banks are n't just selling mortgages to other institutions now , they 're making deals on top of them too , selling \" insurance \" to other big bankers in case somebody stops paying their bills . Eventually , people could n't pay their bills , and the whole mess came tumbling down . Banks failed , others could n't afford to lend any more money so other businesses had to shut down because they could n't get loans any more . So people lose their jobs , and now even more people ca n't pay their bills . Many of these people are stuck in houses they \" bought \" for $ 300,000 but it was never really worth more than $ 100,000 . House prices go down , down , down . And now that so many people are broke , they ca n't afford to buy toys and gadgets and cars like they used to . . . so the companies making those things start to go under or have to shrink and cut more jobs . . . which makes more people broke and unable to afford stuff . . . so more jobs cut . . . on and on and on . That 's where we are right now .",
        "Pretty straightforward topic. I'm a 24 year old guy living in the United States. For various reasons, I've never had anything close to a girlfriend nor do I see it happening. Reasons include: I have universally undesirable physical traits (shortness being the main one), I'm naturally a shy and quiet person, and my inexperience makes my attempts to flirt with girls almost comical. It's seriously affecting my life. My heart is heavy every day I have to walk outside and see couples holding hands, nuzzling each other, spending the holidays with each other. Yesterday I grudgingly went to my friend's house for dinner and had to sit there while he and his girlfriend were practically glowing with their care and love for each other. It made me extremely depressed. I've asked out dozens of girls and gotten rejected. This desire for someone to love me has taken over my life and it's started to encroach on my productivity. And worse, I don't think it's ever going to happen. I read from a CDC study that once males in the United States hit 25 without losing their virginity, very few of them ever get out of that category. I wish it would all go away. I fully believe that if a pill or procedure is developed to exterminate my sex drive cleanly, I would enthusiastically take it. Imagine how much better my life would be. Imagine being able to focus those thoughts, resources and energy towards productive pursuits instead of always having this relationship woe at the back of my mind, tugging me down like an anchor. I know that there are ways to curb one's sex drive, like SSRIs and surgery. But they always involve nasty side effects, that's why I'm talking about a hypothetical pill that would destroy my sex drive forever but without side effects. Can someone convince me this is a bad idea? TL;DR: My sexuality is useless and there's no benefit from it. I've had no luck with women and don't forsee anything. Therefore if I could take a pill to instantly remove my sex drive forever, I'd do it happily. CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "Criminals Perry Smith and Richard \"Dick\" Hickock believe Mr. Clutter of Holcomb, Kansas keeps a large supply of cash on-hand in a safe.On November 15, 1959 at two a.m. they end up murdering Mr. and Mrs. Clutter and their teenage son and daughter.After a little police investigation the two men are found and sentenced to be hanged.In Cold Blood (1967) is directed by Richard Brooks.Now, I haven't read the Truman Capote novel this movie is based on, so I can't make any comparisons.The movie does a brilliant job telling of those horrific events that actually took place.Robert Blake is excellent as Perry.Of course, Blake had the murder case of his own a few years back, being accused of murdering his wife.He's free now, but we still don't know the truth.What ever that may be, he's still a very fine actor.Scott Wilson does remarkable job as Hickock.John Forsythe is terrific as Alvin Dewey.Paul Stewart is very good as Jensen.Jeff Corey is marvelous as Mr. Hickock.Same thing with Charles McGraw who plays Tex Smith.John McLiam portrays Herbert Clutter, Ruth Storey is his wife Bonnie, Brenda Currin is the daughter Nancy and Paul Hough is the son Kenyon.Great job by each of them.There is much to remember from this film.Let's start from the lighter side.It's pretty great when Perry wants to go hunting for gold in Mexico and says to Hickock: Remember Bogart in Treasure of the Sierra Madre?\" And Blake himself was in that movie as a boy! And it's a fun moment when they, giving a ride to that boy and his granddad, collect bottles and turn them in for refund money.Those darker moments are the most haunting ones.The flashback sequence, where you see the murders happening, is extremely terrifying.When Perry goes to kill the girl, Nancy last, and she says \"Oh, please, don't\"...The brutality of man, it's impossible to explain.Then the hanging scene.First there goes Hickock and then Perry, first talking to the minister.In the last image of the movie we see Perry hitting the end of the rope.Sure movies,and books may try to sympathize these villains.Especially Perry's character is someone you could feel sorry for.He thinks of his mom, and dad who he hates, but still loves.But it doesn't change the fact both of these men these actors portray are brutal murderers, who don't feel sorry for anybody.They go to this house and murder an entire family, in cold blood.How could you sympathize these people?",
        "I read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred, went ahead and started watching. I admit that I had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex, involved and full of detail. That is a good thing but also, quite unexpected in this culture of car chases, explosions, gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development. In fact, what a welcome departure, however, I am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what I watch. <br /><br />This film is chock full of character development and plot line; the kind that we used to analyze when I was in high school. It requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer. What a nice change. I would compare it to 'All The President's Men' in terms of generic subject matter. That is, it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially 'own' them. <br /><br />Unlike 'All The President's Men', this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality. In this sense the movie is a character study like 'The Negotiatior' with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In that movie, their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense. Yet, the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other, trust each, and ultimately unite together against the corrupt Police Department. There is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically, there are many similarities. <br /><br />I WILL say that City Hall requires a whole lot more concentration. In fact, I was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals I've seen in my life going back to Watergate. The thing is, the public knows that something is wrong, for sure! but following the details is hard to do. This movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity. I think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film: unrealistic expectations.<br /><br />If one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience, it really is excellent! I watched it 3 times in a row! The acting is superb and the directing is flawless. The weakest link is John Cusak's accent.",
        "As the common saying goes , your freedom to swing your fist ends at my nose . You have the freedom to swing your fist however you want , but if you punch me in the face , you 're responsible for the damage you do to my face . This applies to speech too . You have freedom of speech to say whatever you want , however if what you say harms a person , that person can come after you for damages . However , the protection for freedom of speech is very high . In the United States at least , your * opinions * are generally considered fully protected by free speech as are facts . What can get you sued are knowingly false statements , although the precise definition of that can vary from state to state -- and I presume province to province . What this means is that when you made the statement you * knew * it was n't true , but you said / printed it anyway . On top of that -- except in some rare situations -- you have to actually show that the false speech about you actually caused you damage . To give an example , let 's say I write out \" LoadedNuts is an asshole \" . That statement is an opinion . I am most likely not liable for that . Now I say \" LoadedNuts has AIDS \" . Presuming you do not -- in fact -- have AIDS , you could potentially go after me for libel.^1 However , you have no damages . Damages are n't just things like \" His statement made me feel sad \" or \" His statement hurt my self esteem \" .

It should be noted that the U.S. is very , very friendly to the * defendant * in defamation cases . U.S. law has a very high bar for what you can actually call defamation . Other countries have lower standards on what can qualify as defamation . tl;dr : You do have freedom of speech , but if you say something that hurts someone else , then you might be responsible for repaying them for that damage . * * * 1 : This is actually one of those rare situations I was talking about earlier .

        "Rape is not nearly as prevalent in prisons as popular entertainment makes it out to be . I 'm not citing a study or quoting anecdotal evidence . I 'm speaking from personal experience- having served 8 and a 1/2 years in prison , from when I was 19 until just before turning 28 . Rape happens , but rarely . How rarely depends on the prison and the population it contains . A facility full of people serving 20 years or more will have more instances of rape than a facility full of people serving less than 10 years . When it does happen , it 's almost never as a means for sexual gratification . It 's about power and dominance . Owing money for drugs or gambling , starting fights with gang members , getting caught stealing are situations a person can put himself in to risk that kind of retribution . Even then , rape is the farthest from likely consequence he 'll have to face . The simple reason for this is that there are plenty of people in prison willing to grant sexual favors for several reasons- prostitution being the most frequently occurring . Sometimes guys actually fall in love with each other . Some people take the attitude that it 's not gay while you 're locked up . Whatever the motivation , there are plenty enough gay and bisexual men locked up that a person does n't need to expend the energy of rape to have sex . It also is n't just inmates that prostitute themselves . Some female civilians and correctional officers ( though admittedly few ) will make themselves available for the right price . Others will develop genuine feelings for inmates and risk their jobs to build a \" relationship . \" Also , and this is a factor people do n't often consider . Most people do n't get turned on by the prospect of raping someone , and that holds true for people in prison , too . Most people just take it as a matter of course that rapists are not respected in prison , and that- along with pedophiles- they 're given a hard time . Why , then , would there be an abundance of men willing to rape while in prison ? Prison is not easy , and it is not comfortable , but it is n't the sensationally dismal place it 's made out to be in pop - culture , either . In fact there 's nothing sensational about it at all . The biggest problem the vast majority of people have to deal with is the soul sucking boredom . Are there exceptions ? Of course . But it 's the same kind of exception that people living in the suburbs who are victimized by crimes face . It 's not likely , but it can happen .",
        "Mary had been raised by Christians - the kind who believe that their way is the only way and who deny evolution. Which is what made her so excited when she recieved a vision from God at the age of 16. An angel appeared to her within a dream, \"Jesus can not be born again - the churches must remove their crosses.\" Mary tried to ask a few questions and such, as you would, but class ended and she had to wake up. The first thing she did was speak to her local priest. He told her she was a blasphemer and should be ashamed. God would not pick her to be his prophet. For a start, God always picked men with the exception of a job which could not be done by men. He told her she needed to read the Bible more carefully. Besides, the cross was a symbol of the sacrifice Jesus made for us and so they could not remove it. She should leave and repent of her sins. That night, Mary considered that perhaps she had been wrong after all. But she had another dream, this time the angel told her \"the Jews did not believe at first either.\" So Mary began to take some bigger steps. She told of her dreams and what must be done. She was met with hatred and accused time and time again of being a sinner. Her parents threw her out. TV seemed interested in the'lunatic' but not for long. She acted too rationally, and that didn't hold anyone's attention. Without anywhere to stay, Mary found the nights to be horribly cold. She took shelter in the church since it was empty and the closest she could find for a holy place. She looked around the church she was so familiar with and she remembered the story of Jesus destroying the temple. Perhaps..... If she were braver..... But no, she was on a mission from God, she had to find the courage. She started with the smaller crosses, tearing them from where they were fixed. She kept going, praying to have the superhuman strength she would need for the bigger ones. It was hard work and her fingers were bloody by the end from scraping against the wall. But the crosses were there in a pile on the floor. She was halfway there. As she came back in from dragging out the last of the crosses, Jesus stood before her. \"Thank you. Your faith shall be rewarded in Heaven if not on Earth.\" Not one to doubt (she knew that God rewarded faith over sceptisism, regardless of what was practical in the world), she accepted what he told her and who he was, and said yes when asked to be one of his disciples.",
        "There is your star. There, that one. Helios. That one? Yes, that one. Good. Helios! He-li-os. Where we found the O that made you. On Helios? On Terra, dear one, its third planet.

That is a difficult and excellent question. You know that all matter is made from atoms and molecules. Of course, yes. Including you. Proteins. Yes, I know all that. O contains the instructions for assembling proteins. Which proteins to make, and how precisely to make them, so that the result is a fish, or a panga tree, or you. It is the mind of God made chemical. Oh. That is how our geneticists brought you to life, to me. Do you understand? They read the Terra-O. They read the mind of God. They use O to make many things from your planet. The night-blooming flowers? There, at the back of the garden? Those come from Terra. And the lilies, the roses. So many flowers come from Terra.

I suppose, yes. Yes, you would have been a person on Terra. Who was I? How old was I? Did I look like me? I can not think that it matters now. That planet is dead; the flowers of Terra grow under the light of a different Sun. Someone else tends the garden now, and we will see that it blooms, always.

        "Today is not my Doomsday, but it might as well feel like it as I groggily roll out from under the sheets. I don't bother making the bed. I stumble into the dark bathroom and flip on the light. As I'm doing my thing, I can hear my wife downstairs in the kitchen. She never cooks. I wonder why she's making a fuss about breakfast when she knows she doesn't have to. Then it dawns on me. She must have gotten the calendar alert on her phone. I flush the toilet and move to the sink. My reflection stares back at me as I absentmindedly begin to wash my hands. I don't look old. I'm relatively fit, and have never had any health issues. The scent of Orange Vanilla fills the bathroom. Normally I hate the expensive foamy soaps my wife buys, but today it doesn't bother me. I break my gaze from the mirror as I turn and dry my hands on the towel behind me, then quickly exit the bathroom. As I pull my black work pants on, I tell myself I still have time. I still have fifty-two more weeks..... I grab a white button up shirt from the closet, and an orange tie from my drawer with matching aiguille socks. I look over at the clock on our dresser. The red face reads 9:15am, and I immediately start to panic. I'm late for work! I was supposed to leave over an hour ago! I'm angry at myself as I start to rapidly put on clothes. I shove my arms through my shirt and in my haste I accidentally button the shirt wrong. My legs shoot into my pants, followed by my mis-buttoned shirt, then a black belt rapidly slithers though the loops. Next are socks. The left one has a wrinkle under my foot that needs to be straightened, but I jam it into my dress shoe hastily. I'll fix it later. I am fiddling with my tie as I rush toward the door. I grab the door handle, ready to run downstairs and out the door when it dawns on me. I'm retired today. The government declared that during someone's 1st year, they will no longer be eligible for work. I stare at my hand on the door for a long moment, soaking that in, and slowly deflate. I can't go to work. I hear plates being set on the table, and my thoughts rush to my wife. I feel bad for her. We have three kids together, and now that I can not work she will have to get a second job. My throat clenches tightly. It's hard to breathe. She should have married someone else. Someone with more time. - I actually wrote this for a different prompt, but they were very similar so I edited it a little for this submission.",
        "First off, let me make something clear: I'm not an anti-vaccer, and I dislike anti-vaccers. However, children do not have control over whether or not they're vaccinated; parents do. If a child is kept out of school during an outbreak, it is absolutely not their fault, yet one would end up being punished for it: first, academic performance will likely suffer. Second, one may be seen as an outcast whose parents are kind of nutty, and that may influence one's social life. Additionally, it is unjust that the parents, whose taxes pay for public schools (and who may not be able to afford other schools), will not be given the option to have their child go a public school. I believe that this is different from, for example, someone who pays taxes, but whose children go to a private school, because in that case, the parents still have the option of sending their children to a public school. However, I agree that sending unvaccinated children to school will increase the risk of other children, vaccinated or not, getting sick. So, what I propose is that the federal or state government maintain a list of diseases with known effective vaccines that all children are required by law to be vaccinated for within a certain frame of time, if it's possible. Parents might try to refuse on grounds of religion, but in the US (where I live), one is only free to practice their religion insofar as it doesn't break secular law. Also, since the parents' decision to refrain from vaccination harms their children (as well as other children, potentially), breaking this law wouldn't be a victimless crime, so the law wouldn't really be an infringement on personal freedom. Change my view, Reddit! Convince me that it's better to keep unvaccinated children from public school than to just force them to be vaccinated- or, convince me of an alternate solution to the outbreak-vaccination problem!

        "Lim's Chinese Boofay is a throwback china boofay. If you want seafood and spring rolls and vegetables and no MSG, you'd better head elsewhere. If you remember going to a china boofay in 1979, back when nobody knew or cared that Chinese people never eat this stuff, and you loved the kitschy decor and salty fried food, then Lim's is your place. I'll bet that the recipes and decor are the same as they've been for the last 30 years. You've got your requisite fried rice, lo mein, beefbroccoli, sesame chicken, sweetsour pork, egg foo young, eggrolls, fried chicken, and maybe a couple of other items beyond that. Everything was cooked not so bad as far as the consistency on the Crispy-Greasy Spectrum, but had so much msg that my mouth literally had a buzzing feel when I left. Not a taste, a FEELING, left over from the monosodium glutamate infused cuisine. Blech. The Discard Pile was actually tiny for the sesame chicken, but instead of honey it was flavored with syrupcheapass imitaion\"maple\" corn syrup. Still, I must admit it was lean chunks of white meat chicken, and was my favorite if I had to pick a poison. SS pork looked lean, with large chunks of nonfatty meat, but the insides were a little gristly, and each bite in had about 20 come back out onto the Discard Pile. Seems like they tried to keep it lean, though. In the entire boofay table, there was hardly any color from veggies. All I found was some icebertg lettuce and coleslaw in the cold section, plus brocolli in the beefbroc, carrots and onions in the SS, and some white cabbage and a few onion pieces in the lo mein. That's about it. Oh, the egg rolls had cabbage inside, too, and Are the old school thick skinned, bubbly deep fried and mushy, not the spring roll thin skinned crispy kind. Lim's had some decent flavors and I created a small Discard Pile, so could be a 3Star boofay by getting rid of the msg, using honey instead of syrup on the chicken, and adding a bunch more veggies into the mix. 6.25 lunch (1.50 more for a soda) was not worth it, no matter how much volume you shove in. Still buzzing from the weird msg high. No sir, I don't like it.",
        "Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL's existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann's purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.",
        "To start , of the 6 examples you gave , three are n't types of government , two are basically the same thing , and one is more of a class of government . But I shall press on . * * Types of government * * * Anarchy [ No government . Marxist communism falls here ] Pros : The pros are mostly ideological , individualism taken to it 's extreme . Cons- Nothing preventing any crime , impossible to organize more than 20 people toward a common goal * Direct Democracy [ Each citizen votes directly on every issue ] - Pros : Everyone gets a voice in the government , which keeps people happy . No leaders to screw over the common man for their own gain . Cons : Wildly impractical on any relevant scale ; people are stupid and might vote for stupid things , 51 % of the population can vote to screw over the other 49 % however they like . * Republicanism [ Citizens vote for representatives who then in turn vote on issues ] - Pros : More conservative , unlikely to take any radical action , Career politicians can make nuances decisions , people can still hold their representatives accountable . Cons : Career politicians get less accountable the longer they 're in office , often unresponsive to change , politics becomes massively convoluted thus requiring career politicians * Aristocracy / Oligarchy [ Small group of people in charge of everything ] - Pros : Politicians ( Aristocrats ) have deep personal interest in the land they rule over , politicians careers not in jeopardy over a single gaffe , politicians can focus on doing what they believe is best rather than what the people want , Politicians can be trained from birth for their job . Cons : Unavoidable and unalterable class system , Aristocrats can do whatever they want to the lower classes , aristocrats generally do n't care about the workers , inevitable and purposeful wealth inequality * Dictatorship [ One person in charge of everything ] - Dictator deep personal interest in the land they rule over , dictator can focus on doing what they believe is best rather than what the people want , Dictator can be trained from birth for their job . Cons : Unavoidable and unalterable class system , Dictator can do whatever he / she wants , dictators generally do n't care about the workers , inevitable and purposeful wealth inequality , Generally unhappy people * Fascism [ Very poorly defined .

        "Basically it is very Very simple . So simple that we ca n't see it and have problems understand it . This is what it is : You have two mice mating . This results in a litter of 3 mice . * Mouse 1 - has a very very very small change in the way its eyes sees light . * Mouse 2 - has a very very very slight change of the structure of the fur . * Mouse 3 - has a very very very slight difference in motorskills in its paws . All these changes are random and it is not really seen . What happens next is that the environment will throw situations at them : It might be a forest with a high thick canopy - suddenly this very slight change in mouse 1 means that it has a very very very small chance of seeing that predator before the others . That very small chance when multiplied with all the mice in that bit of forest will by time have a larger chance to survive to breed themselves , this enhances the trait even more . That is evolution . Survival of the fittest does not mean that everyone else dies of , it means that they have a smaller chance of breeding themselves . This is why it is so problematic with how fast us humans can change environment . The animals living there ( or indeed the plants ) just can not adapt to a rapid changing environment . * * * But what if these three mice lived in the Scottish highlands instead of the dark forest ? Well , that very slight change in the fur might mean that that mouse stays dry and there by keeps it 's warmth better than the other two . This means a very slight boost in the odds of surviving there - the better eyes means less in that environment and would not give that mouse as much of an edge . Then again , maybe these mice lives in a city , it might be halfway dark , but there are many walls to climb , and perhaps the third mouse is slightly better at that , meaning it can get to places the others have problems with , resulting in finding more food and a higher survival rate . * * * The thing with evolution is that it is not observable in on generation , we might be talking hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of generations for that very very small change to he a real impact on the animal or plant . Our eyes might have stated out as something that noticed the difference between light and dark and that only . Not in itself very useful , but as it got those very small changes that might have added \" in between \" into the light and dark spectrum and so on . Ah , I hope I make any kind of sense here .

        "Like most other reviewers I have first seen this movie (on TV, never on the big screen), when I was a teenager. My Dad has always regarded this film highly and recommended it to me then, and I must say he was not only right, but this movie has stayed with me forever in the more than 2 decades since I saw it first time. I have seen it two or three more times since then (just a few days ago I gave it another watch) and it has not lost anything of its impact with time. It still a great and well worth to be seen movie! Manr regard Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY as one of the first and best later western, which had a realistic look at life in the old west, but the hardly known LAST HUNT is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier. Actually it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time, or maybe it still is ...<br /><br />Although thinking hard and having certainly seen 100s of western (I like this genre) I can not remember any western as bleak and depressive as this one. Two men bound together, partly by hate, partly by not seeming to have other choices, surrounded by beautiful Ms. Padget, a crippled old man and a young Inian, leading the life of buffalo-killers until fate reaches out for one of them.<br /><br />Nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget its ending and the last frames of this gem. When the camera moves on and away from Mr. Taylor a white buffalo skin comes into sight (on a tree)and echos from the past, when all the hatred began, are present again. Mr. Taylor has got his buffalo, but in the end the buffalo got him. <br /><br />Aside from the top performances of everybody involved, the intelligent script and the great dialogue, it should also be mentioned, that THE LAST HUNT is superbly photograped, I have seldomely seen a western that well shot (aside from the ones directed by Anthony Mann, which are also all superbly photographed), that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well.<br /><br />And director BROOKS is really a superb storyteller. Master craftsmanship!He has made quite a couple of really great movies and was successful in nearly every imaginable genre, but even in an as prolific career as this one, THE LAST HUNT still shines as one of his best, if not his best.<br /><br />Definitely would deserve a higher rating, compared to the 7-something RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY enjoys.",
        "The IXV resembles a smaller, robotically controlled version of the US space shuttle, and could provide Europe with a re-useable orbital transportation system of its own It blasted off on a Vega rocket from South America just after 13:40 GMT. The test data could also inform future Mars landing technologies. The demonstrator flew east around the globe, before coming down in the water west of the Galapagos Islands at about 15:20 GMT. The wedge-shaped IXV (Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle) was designed to gather information on how space objects fall back to Earth. Commenting on the flight, Esa director-general Jean-Jacques Dordain said: \"It couldn't have gone better. \"But the mission itself is not over because now it is necessary to analyse all the data gathered during the flight.\" At the time the craft re-entered the atmosphere, it was moving at 7.5kms. As it pushed against the air, the temperatures on its leading surfaces would have soared to 1,700C. Flaps and thrusters controlled the trajectory, ensuring the IXV came down close to a recovery ship. A parachute system deployed in the very late stages of the flight and put the two-tonne vehicle gently in the ocean. Floatation balloons came out to stop it from sinking. Europe's expertise on re-entry technologies is more limited than, say, the US's or Russia's - something it wants to change with the help of the IXV. Esa's project manager Giorgio Tumino told BBC News: \"Europe is excellent at going to orbit; we have all the launchers, for example. We also have great knowhow in operating complex systems in orbit. But where we are a bit behind is in the knowledge of how to come back from orbit. \"So, if we are to close the circle - go to orbit, stay in orbit, come back from orbit - we need to master this third leg as well as other spacefaring nations.\" Esa has already approved a follow-on spacecraft, called Pride, which looks very similar in design to the X-37B, a robotic craft operated by the American military. No-one is quite sure what missions are flown by the X-37B, but they are likely to include the early testing of new technologies for future satellites. This could be a role also for Europe's Pride vehicle. In-orbit servicing of satellites is a capability often discussed in this context as well. Esa nations will meet shortly to define these roles. \"We need still to agree with all the member states all the different types of operations in orbit. But whatever the payload, it will always be in the perimeter space of civilian applications,\" stresses Mr Tumino.",
        "An internal combustion ( gas , diesel , etc . ) engine is an air pump at heart , you are just adding a little fuel and spark to the mix to get power out of it . Most engines in use today are 4 cycle ( intake , compression , power , exhaust ) . * A mixture of air and fuel is pulled into the combustion chamber by the piston moving downward in the cylinder . * The piston compresses the mix by moving upward in the cylinder . * The mix is ignited , either by a spark plug or the compression alone is sufficient to cause ignition . * The ignited mix expands rapidly , pushing the piston back down the cylinder . * The piston moves back up the cylinder pushing the exhaust gases out , completing the 4th cycle . During the power cycle , the flame front is moving fast enough to be considered an explosion and it creates a shockwave that ends up traveling with the exhaust gases . This shockwave is the sound you end up hearing coming from the exhaust . The reason high performance , racing , engines are louder than vehicles you see on the road has a lot to do with regulations and the general desire of everyone not to be deafened . A lot of it comes from regulation on noise levels , some from pollution regulations , the biggest reason is performance for the race engines . Increasing the performance of an engine is all about increasing its volumetric efficiency , getting more air in so more fuel can be added to that air to make a hotter fire to push the piston harder . There are many ways to make this happen but the easiest way is to remove restrictions on the intake and exhaust sides of the air flow . Most race engines only have enough exhaust pipes to keep the fumes and flames from hitting the driver . Regulations on noise and pollution are not a concern , maximum performance and safety are the goal . For road vehicles , meeting those regulations are the goal . The exhaust system must take the gases to a place where they can be expelled without filling the passenger cabin . It has to provide for pollution regulation with a catalytic converter , these are generally not as restrictive as people think since the pellet type was replaced with honeycomb catalyst material . They also provide for noise regulation with a muffler that dampens the sound . The way a muffler is built gases are given a pretty straight path but sound waves are reflected around quite a bit making them weaker and quieter . You can very easily see this effect for yourself . Just get a sock , preferably clean , and put it in your mouth . Now take a deep breath and yell . Remove the sock and repeat .",
        "Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert, originally published as two separate serials in Analog magazine. It tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966 and it won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel. It is the first installment of the Dune saga. In 2003, it was described as the world's best-selling science fiction novel.\nDune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs.  It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or \"spice\", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.\nHerbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.\nAdaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to a mostly negative response from critics and failed at the box office. The book was also adapted into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and its 2003 sequel Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune). A second film adaptation directed by Denis Villeneuve was released on October 21, 2021, to generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $401 million worldwide. It also went on to win six Academy Awards. Villeneuve's film was essentially the first half of the original novel, and a sequel, which will cover the remaining story, has begun production and is set for release in 2023. The series has been used as the basis for several board, role-playing, and video games.\nSince 2009, the names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted for the real-life nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn's moon Titan.",
        "Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome: America's Legacy of Enduring Injury and Healing is a 2005 theoretical work by Joy DeGruy Leary. \nThe book argues that the experience of slavery in the United States and the continued discrimination and oppression endured by African Americans creates intergenerational psychological trauma, leading to a psychological and behavioral syndrome common among present-day African Americans, manifesting as a lack of self-esteem, persistent feelings of anger, and internalized racist beliefs. The book was first published by Uptone Press in Milwaukie, Oregon in 2005, with a later re-release by the author in 2017.\n\nPost Traumatic Slave Syndrome\nExpanding on a hypothesis of \"post-traumatic slavery syndrome\" by psychiatrist Alvin Francis Poussaint and journalist Amy L. Alexander, DeGruy wrote in her 2001 doctoral thesis that African Americans \"sustained traumatic injury as a direct result of slavery and continue to be injured by traumas caused by the larger society's policies of inequality, racism, and oppression.\" This is summed up in Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome as:\n\nIn the book, DeGruy argues that PTSS is a result of unresolved post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the experience of slavery, transmitted across generations down to the present day, along with the stress of contemporary racial prejudice (e.g. via racial microaggressions). This manifests as a psychological, spiritual, emotional, and behavioral syndrome that results in a lack of self-esteem, persistent feelings of anger, and internalized racist beliefs.\n\nDeGruy states that PTSS is not a disorder that can simply be treated and remedied clinically but rather requires profound social change in individuals, as well as in institutions, that continue to reify inequality and injustice toward the descendants of enslaved Africans.\n\nThe theory has been generative of subsequent academic work in clinical psychology and black studies.\n\nReception\nIn addition to forming the basis of public lectures and workshops offered by DeGruy and her contemporaries, the research described in Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome inspired an eponymous play, which was staged at the Henry Street Settlement Experimental Theater, New York, in 2001.\n\nCritical scholars say that the PTSS hypothesis pathologizes African Americans and is itself racist.\n\nSee also \n Historical trauma\n Sociology of race and ethnic relations\n Weathering hypothesis\n\nReferences\n\n2005 non-fiction books\nNon-fiction books about American slavery\nPost-traumatic stress disorder\nAfrican-American history\nLiterature by African-American women\nAfrican-American studies publications",

Last month one of their hens had gotten out and tore up a quarter acre of soybeans. \" ..... dae Max has breached containment.\" blared out of the radios speaker as he hit the acknowledge button on the emergency radio. \"Once again, a Suidae Max has breached containment. Everyone is advised to seek shelter until it is recaptured.\" The sound trailed off as Schafer headed to the back of the house where Mia was getting the kids in from the yard. \"Best head for the cellar, babe.\" he commented as he reached for his shotgun on the rack above the back door. \"They got a pig loose from The Park\" \"OK, but Annabel's still up in her room. Can you send her her down before you head out. And, try not to kill it. They'll be mad if you do. Remember the stink they made of that damn hen.\" \"They don't want their damn circus freak exhibits killed, they should keep'em on their own damned property.\" replied Schaefer. \"Besides, how big could they grow a hog? I could handle a pork chop the size of my plate right about now.\" He smiled at his wife as he headed up the stairs towards Annabel's room. \"Come on baby girl. Time to head down to the basement with yer mom.\" he called as he hit the top of the steps and pushed open the door to the room Annabel shared with her big sister Kate. \"Lets get a move on.\" Annabel was sitting on her bed in near darkness, staring out her window that looked out the front of the house. She hadn't responded to Schaefer's order, which vexed her father. \"I said, get a move on baby girl. And don't keep your room so dark. Open up the blinds. Some sunshine will do you good.\" he said as he headed towards her window to raise the roller shade. Half way to the window he realized that the shade was already up, and that a sepia colored eye, larger than the sash window, was staring in at him and his daughter. The baritone \"Squeeeee!\" that shook the house was the last thing Schaefer and his family heard as as the beast lowered its head to the ground and began rooting the house apart in search of something tasty.",
        "This is it, years of preparation has finally culminated in this moment. Another walk around the pentagram drawn in perfect chalk on the cement floor of the empty warehouse, and he was sure he was ready. Carefully checking the inscriptions one last time, he raised his hands and invoked the ancient verse of Deilani to summon none other than Satan himself. Blinding blue light emanated from the wording around the pentagram and he had to close his eyes again it. After a few minutes, the light faded and he peered eagerly through the smoke, ready to serve his new master. From the center or the pentagram came a loud..... Belch? The smoke finally cleared revealing a rather ordinary looking man, wearing blue jeans, a white t-shirt with a stain on the left side, and thick rimmed black glasses. The stranger gave an irritated sigh and glared at the perplexed man standing outside the pentagram. \"Seriously? I was in the middle of binge-watching Game of Thrones, did you really have to do this now? Who taught you how to spell, anyway?\" The man took an uncertain step back, this is not the evil mastermind he had been anticipating. Finally, he was able to stutter out a hesitant question. \"W-who are you?\" The stranger shook his head. \"I'm Stan, you idiot. You forgot an'A' in the name,\" the stranger replied while gesturing to the error in his scripture. \"That's impossible!\" He exclaimed. \"I triple checked my work!\" \"Well, next time quadruple check it. I'm tired of you overzealous morons interrupting my personal life because you think you can summon the all powerful Satan\" \"O-of course, sorry. \"He didn't know what else to say or do, maybe it wasn't meant to be. \"Whatever. Just send me back.\" He stared blankly at \"Stan\" who he had summoned. \"You're joking, you did learn how to send things back to where they came from, right?\" \"Well..... \"Not knowing what to say, he averted his eyes, choosing instead to stare at the smooth cement floor. \"Unbelievable, you were just going to summon Satan and let him roam free without sending him back?\" He nodded silently. He really hadn't thought this through, he supposed. With a growl of frustration, Stan pulled a small white stone out of his pocket. \"Well, good thing I'm ready for idiots like you.\" \"What is that?\" he asked nervously. \"A portal stone, it will take me back to my comfy couch and warm apartment and out of this stupid cold warehouse.\" \"Oh.\" \"Listen, don't try this shit again, ok?\" \"Sure,\" he could barely get a reply out before he was blinded by another flash of light, and Stan was gone.",

It was held in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India during 18–20 December 2014. Among supporting organizations of the conference were the Free Software Foundation of India, Centre for Internet and Society (India), Software Freedom Law Center (India) and Swathantra Malayalam Computing.\n\nObjective\n\nAccording to Satish Babu, Director, ICFOSS, free software is capable of offering a freedom-enhancing, robust and reliable alternative, with additional economic advantages, compared to proprietary software, and therefore that free software could find application in the public and private sector organizations in the field of, inter alia, education, arts, and culture.\n\nEvent \n\nThe theme of the event was \"Free Software for a Free World\".  Over 200 delegates attended the conference. The inaugural speech was delivered by Richard Stallman, founder of the free software movement who was of the view that this software should enable access without compromising the security of one's identity. He also told that cameras installed on streets was a threat to the privacy of the public.\n\nOther than Stallman, notable personalities like Smári McCarthy and Nina Paley attended the event.\n\nProf. Rahul De of IIM Bangalore, a speaker at the event, reported during his presentation that over  could be saved in India, if free software was used for ICT in Education in the 320,000 schools across the country.\n\nSessions \nThe following parallel sessions were held:\n Indian Language Computing\n Wikipedia/Wikimedia activities\n Computational Biology & Sciences\n Free Culture\n Freedom on the Cloud\n Free Mobile Platforms\n Education & Spoken Tutorials\n Surveillance, security and privacy & Internet Governance\n Mapping & OpenStreetMaps\n Computing for the Differently-abled\n Free Software in e-Governance\n Open Hardware & IoT\n\nSupporting organizations \nThe following are the organizations that supported the event:\n\n Centre for Internet and Society\n SFLC.IN, Delhi\n Swathanthra Malayalam Computing\n FOSSEE, IIT-Bombay\n SPACE, Thiruvananthapuram\n Department of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Kerala University, Thiruvananthapuram\n Spoken Tutorials, IIT-Bombay\n IEEE Kerala Section\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n\n2014 in India\nFree software culture and documents\nSoftware industry in India\nScience and technology in Thiruvananthapuram",
        "Garet still remembered that day he had decided to become a dealer. He was forced into it, his parents never cared, they were looking for the next welfare check that could buy them coke. Garet had to look out for himself, and he did. Joining a local, drug cartel was not a good idea, but it took Garet some time to realize that. He was never a bad person, always defended himself saying that he never forced anyone to buy drugs, but he was a cog in the gear, and the gear ran in part because of him. But today he had ended it. He stared at the bullet riddled body of Rick, his boss. He stared at the burning warehouse where all the coke was stashed. He heard the sirens sounding in the background. He had won the battle, and the war. He stared at the amber sky, smiling. His hands, legs and even his face was smeared with blood. Not his for a change. He walked into the warehouse, he'd been here several times. He had been a high ranking member of the cartel after all. He was also the boyfriend of the boss' sister, something that had not been taken in a positive way by Rick. Garet knew he had one, maybe two bullets left. The sirens were getting louder, they were pretty close now. The smell that was now predominant in the air was of burning cocaine, the temperature getting hotter, he was sweating, which was funny because this was a chilly December evening. To him, it just smelled like redemption. No one would deal coke in the neighborhood anymore, and Garet was okay with that. He heard gates open, they were here. He stared at the gun one last time, he was not going to be taken off to jail, he knew he would be, he had exposed himself in the process of exposing everyone else. He wasn't looking for a plea deal, he just wanted to end it, and he did. No more murders, shake downs, killing innocent women, children and men. He slowly pointed the gun to his head, there was hesitation, Garet wasn't brave enough to take his own life, but he was going to muster up the courage. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath inside. And he let it go after what seemed like an eternity. \"Fuck it\" he said as in one quick motion he squeezed the trigger. The police burst in the door as Garet died, a gun pointed at his head, a smile on his face.",
        "People currently get antiretroviral therapy only when their white blood cell levels drop. But a US-led study has now been cut short as early treatment was so beneficial for patients. The United Nations Aids agency has called for everyone to get immediate access to the drugs. Around 35 million people are living with HIV and more than 2 million start antiretroviral therapy each year. The discovery of drugs to attack the virus has profoundly changed the way the disease is treated. But there has been fierce debate about when treatment should start. World Health Organization guidelines say treatment should start when there are fewer than 500 white blood cells in every cubic millimetre of blood. The trial on 4,685 people in 35 countries, organised by the US National Institutes of Health, compared this approach with immediate treatment. The trial started in 2011 and was due to run until the end of 2016. But an interim analysis of the data showed that cases of Aids, deaths and complications, such as kidney or liver disease, had already been halved by early treatment. All patients on the trial are now being offered antiretroviral drugs. The director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, said: \"We now have clear-cut proof that it is of significantly greater health benefit to an HIV-infected person to start antiretroviral therapy sooner rather than later. \"Moreover, early therapy conveys a double benefit, not only improving the health of individuals but at the same time, by lowering their viral load, reducing the risk they will transmit HIV to others. \"These findings have global implications for the treatment of HIV.\" Michel Sidibe, executive director of at UNAids, argued: \"Every person living with HIV should have immediate access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy. \"Delaying access to HIV treatment under any pretext is denying the right to health.\" Dr Steve Taylor, the lead HIV Consultant at the Birmingham Heartlands HIV Service, told the BBC the trial was hugely important. \"Not least that they will they will change the way HIV treatment is prescribed in the UK and around the world. \"Based on this study, people will be able to access treatment much earlier than currently, which is good for their own health and will reduce HIV transmission.\" Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: \"These exciting results should dramatically change the approach to treatment for people living with HIV, both in the UK and internationally.\"",
        "\" Sir, if you just TRY it! Just test it in a lab! Please, just..... \" \" Mister Percy, \" a voice interrupted. \" Nobody wants to try any of your potions. They don't work and you are becoming a real thorn in my side. Now please leave our facilities before I call security... again. \" \" You're making a mistake!. \" Percy shouted back at the voice, with his finger up in the air. \" A grave mistake! \" \" Securit.... \" \" Im going! \" Mr. Percy left the room. This had been the third medical firm to dismiss him today. \" They'll come around eventually, \" he repeated to himself as he rubbed his hands against his briefcase. At first sight, Mister Levi Percy is nothing more than a lunatic. With an unshaven face, unkempt hair, and a dirty suit, it makes sense to assume he is a broken man. He's been called a liar, a quack, and an enemy of science, but none of these names have ever deterred Levi Percy. His head hangs low, but his spirits rise higher than ever; For Mister Percy has in his possession the most powerful concoction known to man - a cure-all potion. Just one sip has the ability to cure the human body from any and every ailment. No, It is not magic. It is simply an invention procured by an eccentric madman. And unfortunately for poor Levi Percy, nobody believes a madman. But he was far from discouraged as he staggered outside from the medical firm he'd just gotten rejected from. And without missing a beat, Percy once again began to market his drug. \" What if I told you that I have in my hands a bottle of the most miraculous stature. \" He yelled to a nearby gathering people. \"A bottle of life itself! Why, just one sip will cure you of all your sickness and sorrows! All the way from cancers and tumors to broken bones and nosebleeds, this potion can cure it all. Even the rainy-day blues don't stand a chance when you've got this stuff. \" But like always, nobody believed him. Back on the streets and as ambitious as ever, Mister Percy will never slow down or stop trying to sell his miracle product. He will never be rich and he will never be famous. In an ironic twist of fate, the man with the most power is least equipped to handle it. It is a shame that the best gift to mankind is left in the hands of a madman, a brilliant mind cursed with the mannerisms of a lunatic. He is a rare breed of genius - the kind that will forever go unnoticed and unable to hold ground in a world of skeptics. If only they would listen to him... But nobody listens to poor Mister Percy. Poor, poor Mister Percy.",
        "This is a low-budget spoof of the espionage genre. To help frame your expectations, you should know that: (1) The acting is wildly heavy-handed. The stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures, and off-key pacing. (2) The script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility. Oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements. (3) Shots are frequently framed in off-balance angles, poking fun at genre excesses. (4) A pop-eyed Jeff Goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner.<br /><br />The film has a guiding intelligence, deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the B-films of the 1930's: a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by Carl Sagan. The film's over-the-top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes. In an early running gag, Fay Grim's son Ned is so frequently told to leave that you can't help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad. Parker Posey's nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film.<br /><br />The film's slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge. The film's impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy. Moreover, it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic. The musical score is intentionally heavy handed, and I found this (and the off-kilter camera angles) more irritating than humorous.<br /><br />The over-the-top acting, the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiracies/counter conspiracies, and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers. The movie is much too long at 158 minutes.<br /><br />That said, fans who are receptive to the film's sarcasm might want to watch again ... using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog. The film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy-handed than light-hearted. But, the comedy may well appeal to your tastes. The film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films, fans of director Hal Harley, or devotees of Parker Posey (who has the most camera time).",
        "Your question does not say this explicitly, but I assume that you were once a W-2 employee.  Each paycheck a certain amount was withheld from your check to pay income, social security, and medicare taxes.  Just because you did not receive that amount of money earned does not mean it was immediately sent to the IRS.  While I am not all that savvy on payroll procedures, I recall an article that indicated some companies only send in withheld taxes every quarter, much like you are doing now.  They get a short term interest free loan.  For example taxes withheld by a w-2 employee in the later months of the year may not be provided to the IRS until 15 January of the next year.   You are correct in assuming that if you make 100K as a W-2 you will probably pay less in taxes than someone who is 100K self employed with 5K in expenses.  However there are many factors.  Provided you properly fill out a 1040ES, and pay the correct amount of quarterly payments, you will almost never owe taxes.  In fact my experience has been the forms will probably allow you to receive a refund.  Tax laws can change and one thing the form did not include last year was the .9% Medicare surcharge for high income earners catching some by surprise.    As far as what you pay into is indicative of the games the politicians play.  It all just goes into a big old bucket of money, and more is spent by congress than what is in the bucket.  The notion of a \"social security lockbox\" is pure politics/fantasy as well as the notion of medicare and social security taxes.  The latter were created to make the actual income tax rate more palatable.     I'd recommend getting your taxes done as early as possible come 1 January 2017.  While you may not have all the needed info, you could firm up an estimate by 15 Jan and modify the amount for your last estimated payment.  Complete the taxes when all stuff comes in and even if you owe an amount you have time to save for anything additional.  Keep in mind, between 1 Jan 17 and 15 Apr 17 you will earn and presumably save money to use towards taxes.  You can always \"rob\" from that money to pay any owed tax for 2016 and make it up later. All that is to say you will be golden because you are showing concern and planning.  When you hear horror stories of IRS dealings it is most often that people spent the money that should have been sent to the IRS.",
        "British Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.Reporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of £75m ($141m) compared with £125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were \"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. BA's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.In October, it increased this from £6 to £10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £2.50 to £4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. \"For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.It also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's latest quarterly results as \"pretty modest\". \"It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,\" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. \"Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,\" Mr Eddington said. \"For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds.\" BA's shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.",
        "Audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching: a full-fledged, beautiful full-length Technicolor film. I can't say for sure, but this might have been the first one (3-strip). At any rate, it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on DVD. In fact, just how good it looks is amazing.<br /><br />Kudos for that have to go out to Director Richard Boleslowski, Director Of Photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures and, for the DVD - MGM Home Entertainment. All of them combined to give us one of the best-looking films of the classic-era age.<br /><br />I thought the story was so-so: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. It gave a nice message in the end, even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it. I can't say more without spoiling things.<br /><br />Marlene Dietrich never looked better, I don't believe, and certainly never played such a soft-hearted character (\"Domini Enfilden\"). Heart-throb Charles Boyer was the male star and Domini's object of affection, but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as \"Batouch;\" John Carradine as \"The Sand Diviner;\" The most memorable, to me at least, was the dancer \"Irena,\" played by Tilly Losch. Wow, there is a face and a dance you won't soon forget! I've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films I've viewed. Just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the DVD. Looking at her IMDb resume, she was only in four movies, but they were all well-known films.<br /><br />Basil Rathbone, the actor who really became famous for playing \"Sherlock Holmes,\" also is in here as is C. Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his day. Schildkraut, by the way, will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit, \"The Shop Around The Corner,\" with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan.<br /><br />The beautiful direction, photography and color, and Tilly's dance, are the things I'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not-so-good things all rolled into one. Had the last half hour been better - although I admire the ending - I would have rated it even higher. It's definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection.",
        "I took off my spiked helmet and picked up my mug of ale. Ever since Lord Bloodstone took over, food and drinks were free. Heck, the bartender, a elf named J'alen, was much happier ever since the take over.'Heroes' no longer started battles in his bar, so he could actually keep people coming in. I could even see a few regulars now and then. Life had improved once Bloodstone took over. Sure, the sky was constantly red, occasionally a portal to a hell dimension opened up or a creature shaped like a hexagon with three eyes would try and make deals with you, but it wasn't all bad. Food came in abundance, necromancy was legalized and everyone who didn't have a job could work for Lord Bloodstone. I took a seat next to Darian and Athroben, my coworkers. We'd known each other from childhood, growing up on the same street. Eventually, we decided to all work as guards for Lord Bloodstone. We made decent wages, enough to each have a small apartment and the hours were great. \"So, I've been thinking, what if we took a trip, right?\" Athroben said. \"I here the Gulf of Eternal Horror is nice in the summer.\" He ran a hand through his dirty blonde hair that always seemed to be in a perpetual state of hat hair. \"Dude, no way, the Gulf is crazy, especially with...\" Darian began, but stopped as the door of the bar opened. A young man, no older than us, walked in. His hair was bright green and gelled into spikes. On his back was a massive sword, bigger than he was. I should've been impossible to lift, let alone carry, but he walked with it as if it was nothing but cardboard. The guy approached the bar and stood stock still. After a few minutes, J'alen approached, giving him the friendliest smile he could. \"Can I help you?\" he asked. The green haired guy looked at him, a broad grin across his face. \"Hoy there barkeep!\" he said, the already disturbing grin getting bigger as he spoke. \"Could you point me in the direction of Lord Bloodstone's castle?\" J'alen looked in our direction and mouthed'hero'. I rolled my eyes and looked at the guys. Athroben pulled out his crossbow and fired a bolt into the hero's temple, a fine spray of brains and skull fragments decorating the bar. The hero wobbled for a moment before collapsing to the floor, his corpse twitching. I took a swig of my ale and shook my head. Another idiot dead. Not that it mattered anyway. After all, why would we want liberation from Lord Bloodstone? As we drug the dead guys body towards the community necromancy pit, I chuckled to myself. Sometimes it was good to be bad.",
        "Who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community? Certainly not the makers of \"Fido,\" who take us to a never-never-land version of the 1950's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to \"life\" by radiation from outer space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time.<br /><br />This twisted, modern-day spin on the TV series \"Lassie\" - it might easily have been entitled \"A Boy and His Zombie\" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre-'60s concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. The movie doesn't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. Instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine). Despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950's itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade.<br /><br />K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and his Cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.<br /><br />This is what \"Lassie\" might have been had Timmy's best friend been afflicted rabies.",
        "Every slice must be precise, every amount must weigh and measure enough and every piece of meat or vegetable must be cooked to perfection. It's five in the morning, three people are working in the kitchen and four on the stool. This is a small shop yet it has the precision and technique of a fine Michelin restaurant. The pay here is decent, but not a lot of people eat in this place. I work at a small diner in New York, hidden behind the crumbling apartments and landfills. The owner is an old fellow, immigrant from Naples. He usually sits alone in the boss office at the back, doing paperwork. You would expect, with its empty location and relative lack of customers that it would be bankrupt by now. However, the business seems to be afloat, no power failures, clean water, everything seems to paid. The training was intense. Three days of intense culinary training. Afonso is nice kind old man when you talk to him, but in the kitchen, the guy's like Gordon Ramsay. Everything needs to be detailed, the mushroom is a centimeter short and you're out. Luckily, three of us stayed. We had nothing to do, we were all homeless and this seemed to be the best job here so I guess we stayed. Plus, vacations were frequent. The door chimes rang as two men entered. They were young, around late 20s, wearing business outfits. \"Ahh, new girl, Af must have hired new people,\" one of the gentlemen said. \"Would you be interested in a drink, water or soda?\" The waitresses were hired with us. She was acting pretty calm, but I can tell she was nervous. \"Yes, we would like 3 of your draft beer, to go, as well as a chicken parm, a Margarita and a clam linguine. Since you're new, I would like to inform you that this is the usual,\" the man spoke very clearly like he had been here a hundred times. He hasn't even looked at the menu. \"Yes, thank you sir. Anything else?\" \"No, thank you.\" She ran to the kitchen and placed the orders. The kitchen lit up on fire. The air smelled of caramelized garlic and tomatoes. Once of the guys did the Margarita. The other did the chicken. I did the seafood linguine. Everything was prepped so dishes came flying off the kitchen very quickly. Maybe time just flies when you're stressed. The men accepted their orders and stood. They held their order, encased in plastic in one hand. As they exited, one of them spoke. \"New guys are good. I bet boss will like it.\" \"Yeah, I guess he won't shut the place down anytime soon.\"",
        "Really, I think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film. In fact, the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining.<br /><br />Yes, the script is a little convoluted, but that's the genre. The film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. Just like all the old noir classics, this, too, has a screenplay that twists you around so that you don't always know how to make sense of it at first, and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all of the pieces together. That's the genre. In general, the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and, in turn, surprised, without abandoning the viewer.<br /><br />Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is she looks great and she speaks her double-entendre laden dialog in such a way as to zhuzh it up into something mysterious, sexy and fun.<br /><br />The direction is more than passable, because let's face it--you have to keep an audience interested in the \"did she or didn't she?\" question for two hours. In addition to a twisty script and a fun performance by Stone, this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time, with straight industrial lines to go along with Stone's sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful--press pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye.<br /><br />The film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first film and turns them into something a little more real, particularly the sex. \"Katherine Tramell is bisexual...how shocking!\" becomes treated more matter-of-factly here, and typically, the sexuality of the film is used to better effect. It is still titillating, but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first. I won't say that it isn't still somewhat of a gimmick because, let's face it, this film is supposed to be fun.<br /><br />And a fun film it is. It may be an easy target, but if you watch it for what it is: a noirish, femme-fatale driven, twisty, sexy, did-she-or-didn't-she who-dunnit, you're bound to enjoy it (no pun intended).",
        "Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a pedantic point. Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: \"there is no consistent moral framework.\" The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate. A few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life. Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry. Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus? I don't see a justification for either behavior on 'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral. After giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed. I think if I could go back in time I would probably have said \"CMV: If it is immoral to have sex with animals, then it is immoral to eat them\" but as far as the existence of consistent moral frameworks justifying one of the behaviours but not the other, I am thoroughly convinced.

        "Boufgar Memorial Magic School, an esteemed academy ran by the Runewhistle Dwarf Dufhet. The school specializes in teaching Runecarving, Enchantment, and Necromancy. Students there are required, by law of the Runewhistle hivemind, to learn, study for some good years, then die if they are not considered geniuses. The student body is composed entirely of Dwarves, who have no problem with dying like this. They're a hivemind, after all, and if they don't die they grow until their legs break under them and they starve. Scary shit. Nobody's really ever had a problem with the students dying at the end of the year, all Dwarves usually die that age. Their mana is put to good use afterwards, so the only issue is morality, and that's only if you don't understand. Fwyn does not understand. She's an Elf doing studies on Dwarven culture, and she has decided to begin at the educational system. Fwyn does not know what she's getting into. Fwyn stormed into the Headmaster's office, \"Dufhet, what the FUCK!? You're killing graduates?!\" The Dwarf looked at her, \"We're killing dropouts, too. That's how it works.\" \"What?! Is this some sort of cult?! You're murdering these people!\" Her wings twitched. \"These people are destined to die, Fwyn. If it wasn't like this, it would be worse.\" \"Worse!? You're killing them as soon as they're out of school! They have lives to live after this!

        "I am the type of person that has good days during which I can focus well and poor days during which my head hurts, I feel uncomfortable or am tired, among other reasons. The reason I bring that up is because the grade I get on an exam is largely determined by that factor of my daily feeling. If I have a test on a certain day I feel great, I can get way greater than the average. If I don't feel good that day, I get below or way below average. It has nothing to do with the knowledge of the subject, but rather my ability to focus due to distractions. In addition, I get nervous during exams because they make up so much of the grade. I usually find myself having to re-read a question three or four times because I have an adrenaline rush and then the fact that I'm taking so long to re-read the questions (which are usually long and complicatedly-worded) makes me even more nervous because I feel like I won't finish in time by wasting this time. After all this, I think the best reason for my view is that for every exam (I am a STEM major) I take, the professor does not test us on every single topic but rather 50-75. This combined with the fact that I usually only have 5-9 questions for a 2-2.5 hour long test means that grades are dependent on what you happen to be certain on. For example, let's say it's the low-ball 5 question test. Let's say I know each topic presented pretty well and I get a 90 (points off for stupid mistakes). However, I went into the test knowing that I did not understand one topic. Now... what happens if that topic ends up on the test? In my experience, this topic could span not only one but two questions. That means, just my sheer luck a 90 could go down to a D. I do not think exams are a good indicator of subject knowledge when the outcome can range so greatly between an A and a D from luck of the questions and your physical state the day of the test. Sure, I guess I deserve a D for not knowing, but this system of radical grade range means to me that it is not precise and therefore a poor indicator of knowledge. To recap for a TL;DR: 1. Some days I feel bad, some days I feel incredibly good. 2. I get nervous during tests easily and 'blank' on questions. 3. Your grade is dependent on the luck of the question. Why does all of this matter in the long run? Because 2-4 exams in universities usually make up 50-80 of your total grade. Note: Not sure if I want to include SATs as an exam in this case but I guess if you want to talk about them you can",
        "Video games,[a] also known as computer games, are electronic games that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback. This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.\nVideo games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.\nThe first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game was the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the golden age of arcade video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s, but suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many of which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.\nIn the 2000s, the core industry centered on \"AAA\" games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development (or indie games) to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game market has estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services. This is three times the size of the 2019 global music industry and four times that of the 2019 film industry.",
        "I'm not a cop hater. I like to think I'm a relatively reasonable person but I'm honestly not even 100 sure how I really feel with the constant barrage of news stories about police breaking the law and victimizing regular citizens. I replied to another redditor saying to basically always do what a cop says [here] Section of his comment If a police officer asks you to do something, you do it. Pretty much without exception. If you wish to challenge the police officer's legal right to do something, the proper venue is in Court and not in the street. and my reply That's horse-shit buddy Despite the sheer magnitude of the amount of recent cases of police blatantly abusing their power with zero retribution I am still of the opinion that most officers are genuinely decent people. But like any other human, they carry inclinations for benevolence AND iniquity. Honest intentions sadly don't always equal righteous actions and authority must be challenged. Always. Full stop. I'm not some edgy teenage anarchist. The police work for the public. They need to constantly be held accountable and should never be beyond reproach You say the proper venue to challenge the police's legal right to do something is in the courts; I say the proper venue is any and everywhere. I do believe this but reading it back to myself and trying to see it from someone else point of view I feel like I sound like some kind of deluded government conspiracy theorist. EDIT: It's been pointed out that my title is shitty and misleading. I'll restate my position better but as of now I no longer hold that view specifically. Cops have authority. I fully support that. I believe it's necessary for a society to function for there to be people to enforce the law by means greater than what the average citizen should be allowed. I also believe those enforcers should be held to a higher moral standard. That they should not violate the reach of the powers we give them. And that if they do, we, the very people that gave them the power in the first place, have our own duty to not allow it despite such disobedience being an often unsafe and likely consequential undertaking. Might doesn't make right. I definitely don't want to get my ass beat andor thrown in jail for pissing off the wrong cop by not letting him violate my rights and despite my position I don't know if I would have the courage in the moment to stand up to a weaponized bully but I do know it would be the right thing to do. Maybe not the smart thing, but the right thing. I'm not saying to go around saying the fuck the police and disobeying them for no reason. I'm saying only show deference when they are acting appropriately.",
        "'My God... Look at these statistics.\" \"Yes sir, they're off the charts.\" \"How... How have they accomplished so much so fast! They just discovered the combustion engine! Their growth rate is insane. This is unsustainable.\" \"Completely unsustainable Sir. We are predicting the collapse of their planet's carbon dioxide sustainers within 30 revolutions.\" \"Then they're on the verge of total collapse?\" \"No sir... They seem to be thriving. Their current rate of technological advance is both driving their destruction and increasing their ability to adapt. In fact, we predict that they will achieve singularity and will likely colonize surrounding celestial entities within 30 revolutions.\" \"Amazing. Their shared networking must be incredibly advanced to achieve this.\" \"Actually Sir, they don't have a shared networking interface. At least, not in the organic sense.\" \"Explain.\" \"They seem to be biologically individual, with no ability to interconnect to a shared existence. Spiritually and mentally, they are individuals. They have no genetic imprinting memory. In fact, we think that they haven't discovered the dimensional existences yet.\" \"No genetic memory? No shared existence? How long do they live?\" \"78 revolutions, we think.\" \"Amazing. To think that they can achieve all of this with no interconnected memory. It defies logic!\" \"There's something else sir. They seem to be attempting to create an Event Horizon.\" \"What! How?\" \"By hurling atoms at each other. We've been searching for a containment field for an Event Horizon... But we can't seem to find one. We don't think they know what they're doing.\" \"They're going to wipe themselves out, and half this solar system with them if they're not careful. What a quaint species. To think that they can't even access second existence. Amazing. Consensus?\" \"Science thinks that we should monitor them to see what they might accomplish, Sociology wants to help them immediately, and our Economics team wants to harness their potential strength.\" \"Any threats?\" \"Numerous ones, Sir. Their individuality is something we're having trouble predicting. We're worried they could disable the Coalition if introduced.\" \"Understandable. Maybe we should try an experiment? How about we give them something advanced that helped stabilize parts of the Coalition.\" \"What do you have in mind sir?\" \"Velcro.\" \"Ah. Sir, I regret to inform you that they've already discovered it. We know it was just introduced to the Coalition, but it seems that this planet discovered Velcro many revolutions ago. Science is still trying to figure out how they made the jump, but we haven't reached a conclusion yet.\" \"Amazing! Simply amazing.\"",
        "I'm afraid this one is pretty dreadful, despite several good performances and generally competent acting-for-the-camera direction. It's a first and last attempt by writer-director Soo Lyu. \"Rub and Tug\" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of Canada's program to promote home-grown film-making. While the program encourages worthwhile efforts like \"New Waterford Girl\" it opens the door for untalented novices like Lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this project but was green-lighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials. <br /><br />You don't mind the low budget because the shabby production design, bad lighting, poor audio, and dreary docu-style shot selection is consistent with the subject matter; the workers in Canadian massage parlors. But the dialogue and the plotting doesn't give the actors anything to work with, the editor much to assemble, or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief. When your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique; even though nothing happens, the movie is hard to follow and point-of-view impossible to pin down. <br /><br />Don McKellar's performance as Conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in \"Exotica\". Lindy Booth's Lea is her standard quirky airhead; as always she is likable but here she is little else. Kira Clavell's Cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of any consequence, Tara Spencer-Nairn's street-wise Betty, more than cancels out her excellent performance in \"New Waterford Girl\". Her shallow performance in \"Rub and Tug\" should curtail any tendency to seek out other films in which she has appeared; unless you need further confirmation of \"Waterford\" director Alan Moyle's skill in working with young actors. <br /><br />You quickly conclude that Lyu's reptilian brain cannot grasp concepts like plot complexity, so the need to insert a lazy and lame \"deus ex machina\" device toward the end is hardly a surprise. Still it could be worse, the listless story has so little internal logic anyway that the unlikely ending is not as painful as would normally be the case. <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",
        "The Drug Years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini-series or other kinds of TV documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on TV. It's actually not long enough, in a way. All of the major bases in the decades are covered, and they're all interesting to note as views into post-modern history and from different sides. But it almost doesn't cover enough, or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time. For example, the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs (partly the marijuana, later cocaine) is really well presented, but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to cover.<br /><br />Overall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs, pop-culture, government intervention, the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia, all felt the wave of various drugs over the years, and the interplay between all was very evident. Nobody in the film- except for the possibility of small hints with the pot)- goes to endorse drugs outright, but what is shown are those in archival clips about the honesty of what is at times fun, and then tragic, about taking certain drugs. The appearances of various staunch, ridiculously anti-drug officials does hammer some points down hard- with even in such an overview of the drug cultures and America's connection as a whole- as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the interviewees. The only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not 'just say no', because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought. It is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be hypocritical about them (as, for example, oxycontin continues on in the marketplace).<br /><br />Is it with the great interest and depth of a Ken Burns documentary? No, but for some summertime TV viewing for the young (i.e. my age) who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago, as well as for the 'old' who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks, careless times, and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it. There are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased, which is not totally untrue, but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social, political, and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving (for better or obvious worse) for enough of a fascinating view.",
        "This guy sounds like a nice guy. He sounds like he's in a rut, a real rut, and I am genuinely sorry for him. But, I still want to examine his situation, and figure out, is this really a problem with the economy, with the government, or with bad decision making. Criticism 1: This guy is 37, and has a graduate degree, a wife and one son. Sounds good so far. But what is his graduate degree in? I can't quite tell from the article, but from one sentence near the bottom I believe it has something to do with Creative Writing... Why do people do this to themselves? Spend tens of thousands of dollars on literally POINTLESS degrees. The best writers in history, did not study it or get a graduate degree. I write in my spare time. Just read some good novels and try to emulate it. This is a hobby, or a job you take time off to do when you aren't struggling. Not a career. CMV Criticism 2: Marriage and kids... I don't know this guy's situation, and he is at an age in life when this makes more sense than in many other situations, but in my humble opinion you should not get married or have a kid until you are financially stable. PERIOD. He should have waited till they both had their visa to move, or he should have waited to marry till his wife could work. And he had the choice to have a kid, 3 choices in fact, the moment of, the morning after, and the first trimester. It is ridiculous and immoral to have a kid in this day and age when you can't afford one. CMV Criticism 3: Portland OR. I freakin' LOVE Portland. Looks so great! I lived in the west cost for 3 months and visited OR, unfortunately never saw the city, and I absolutely LOVE OR. However, where should you live if you don't have a lot to live off of? Not Portland. The West Coast has high taxes and a high cost of living. I have friends who are living quite well on 20k down here. It makes it easier, its not a fix it solution though. So, yes, living on 20k at 37yo with a wife and kid in Portland OR is a horrible situation. But my complaint is, how much of that damage is self inflicted? I still want to help the guy, but shouldn't he get a little criticism for all of this. Idk. CMV",
        "Well, I don't think the picture is as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be. . . but there's no denying that it's got problems.<br /><br />Mostly, the problems are in the script. There's a plot - but not much story, and certainly not one that anybody could call plausible; it trots out any number of self-consciously strange and/or stereotypical characters, lines, moments, what-have-you and, by the end, it just hasn't added up to much in this department.<br /><br />Sorry, but I couldn't care less about whatever \"social ill\" Farnsworth might be trying to address; there will always be a sector of the population willing to do just about anything to shred their brains, even if it requires running around corn fields trying to steal ammonia, or whatever it is those morons do. So, as a film, you won't find me calling \"Iowa\" \"important.\" But, at a stylistic level, the picture is more than interesting and some of Farnsworth's choices in depicting a meth-head's wigged-out state are beautiful, hilarious, disturbing and - yes, I'm going to say it - inspired.<br /><br />The acting is uneven, but that just may be a casualty of the afore-praised stylistic reaching. Look, Rosanna Arquette is a fine actress - but she's not very good here, so a discriminating audience member does have to ask, \"What happened?\" It's weird that Diane Foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few of the other actors can come anywhere near. For example, I might seriously consider whatever explanation Farnsworth could provide for Michael T. Weiss's over-the-top turn as a probation officer, but I doubt I'd ever buy it; It Just Doesn't Work. <br /><br />Then again, it's the most alive and in the moment that I've seen John Savage appear in years. So go figure.<br /><br />This is the sort of work that tantalizes, but does not promise - and that's okay; neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make movies. So, whether or not Farnsworth has another film in him remains to be seen, but if he does, it seems pretty likely that it won't be bland pap. In an age when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of \"American Idol,\" perhaps we could allow, not scorn, Farnsworth's legitimate and undeniably flawed film. <br /><br />What is more, perhaps we could welcome, not berate, his energetic and sometimes blessedly idiosyncratic imagination.",
        "Mr. Jones absently stared at the four round patches of ash in his perfect lawn. He had sworn to keep his old friend's lawn beautiful when he became President of the United States, and accepted a life of near constant surveillance to do it. A trifle to some in this age, but a hard sacrifice for a freed-loving man from the mountains. His loyalty to his friend and pride in his work were what kept him going. Now, he hardly noticed the procession of giant insects solemnly walking towards the White House. He had failed in his duty. Resistance was futile. Arnold, chief of security, had already lost two men trying to stop the steady advance of the aliens. If you stayed out of their way you were fine, but attempt to stop them and you were toast. Literally. The halls smelled like burning hair in some places. They were clearly here for the President. At first they (slowly) made for the Oval Office, but when the President was evacuated they changed direction to follow him. He would have been flown or driven out by now except that all approaching vehicles had been immediately destroyed by the alien landing craft. The invaders themselves and their ship seemed resistant to all forms of attack. President Reed was a very nice old man, and very honorable. When faithful Arnold had run to him and desperately tried to say everything but \"I can't stop them,\" Reed calmly shushed him and said, \"It's obviously me they want. If I go they may leave the rest of you alone.\" He began to walk towards the aliens, who had just rounded a corner in the bunker and entered the long escape tunnel. \"Sir, will you at least leave your cat here?\" Arnold pleaded. \"Mittens has kept me company all three years of my Presidency, and I will certainly want him wherever I go now.\" President Reed, you see, had the one eccentricity that he always kept his cat with him, to the dismay of all his stricter staff members. Mittens was in his arms now, a regally purring pile of white fluff. At his command all of the President's company stayed behind. Reed approached the aliens at the same pace they approached him. He showed no fear. When they stood about a meter away the aliens stopped. The President stopped as well. There were five of them, one in front and four double-file behind. The one in front was carrying a golden box with red hinges in two of its little arms. It reached forward, opened the box - And revealed catnip and a beautiful salmon fillet inside. President Reed decided he was going to get along with the aliens very well.",
        "\"You! Yes, you! Give me a story!\" they demanded. \"A story?\" I asked. \"Yes! A story!\" \"But I'm just a run-of-the-mill servant, All Might One. How could I possibly entertain you of all beings? I can barely entertain Writing Prompts redditors...\" \"Aye! But we the creator, in granting your lot with free will, have lost our ability to live inside your minds. We are curious. We are intrigued. What kind of mighty legends can one such as yourself muster? You are a storyteller, are you not? A wielder of tales? Try one on me!\" \"Very well..... \"Once upon a time there was a mighty God. Their ability to conjure up great sums of creational energy pushed them to create an infinite universe. Within this universe, they exploded hundreds of burning lights, the fire of which lit up the void and sprouted countless masses of independent, living matter. This matter condensed and hardened into an infinite count of planets, moons, and meteors, each new creation wondrous and infinitely special in its own way. \"What the God did not expect, was for some of these planets to produce life. And so the cycle of life began, producing cells, aquatic beings, large lizards, stupid bipedal beasts, and other distant creatures some of us will never encounter. All of this amused the God, but also terrified them, for it meant that what he had produced in jest would have to become a serious undertaking. \"So they observed from a far, as the dominant beasts of countless unconnected worlds populated their dominions with countless constructions of their own making. Some were impressive, others downright frightened the God. And so they made their first attempt at dismantling creation. \"This, however, failed, as creators are never truly able to destroy what they produce. So is the unwritten law of the universe. Therefore, they watched as centuries unfolded, hoping for a time when creation, as it is, would not be so stupid and blundersome. \"And though they hoped, this wish seemed impossible, for the beings insisted on demolishing their world, piece by piece, fellow creature by fellow creature. In the end the God grew bored and wandered their universe alone, only interacting when the fancy most suited them.\" My narrative done, I stood perfectly still. Hoping against hope that the God would not be offended. After a long pause, the God responded: \"Hmm..... yes..... I guess that was a horrible story...\" \"I did warn you! Maybe the next creature you meet will have a better one?\" I offered, encouragingly. \"I doubt it...\" they grumbled, walkingfloatingor cloud swimming away as only Gods can.",
        "This was just another marvelous film of the Berlin Festival. But unlike \"Yes\", by Sally Potter, which I had seen some days before, where after leaving the cinema I felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive, this time quite the opposite thing happened: there was something that dragged me down, and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe. It was as if, all of a sudden, there was nothing left, all hope, all future had been taken away to a dead place.<br /><br />Nina's life seemed to be dismal and locked, but then, one lovely day, there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams. There was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion, just out of nothing, someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life. That person was Toni, a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots, just like herself.<br /><br />But the film's title is \"Ghosts\", and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish, there is no way to retain them Ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people, strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself, hiding away from all other people. Françoise, a French woman, is a victim of such ghosts. She once lost her child daughter in Berlin, who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket, in just one moment of inattentiveness. Now time has passed, and Françoise is back in Berlin, still looking for the missing child.<br /><br />Nina could be that child, after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart-shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity.<br /><br />And Nina adopts that idea, after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion, she also longs for a mother. But in the end she is empty-handed, Toni has disappeared with a man, and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman. \"Marie is dead,\" concludes Françoise's husband, and the statement could not be more disillusioning. Nina is just a \"niña\", a girl without name, there is no hope for any divine fulfillment. There is no Marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives. Therefore, in the end, we see Nina all alone, about to walk along the road that has opened up before her, into a future that seems joyless and uncertain.",
        "It 's all about population density . In an urban area , having a lot of people around is the norm . This has benefits and disadvantages . It means help in any number of ways is usually nearby ( police , fire , you need a jump from your neighbor , etc ) . It also means that other people 's behavior can adversely affect you because you live in close proximity to them . If your neighbor constantly plays loud music , this can greatly impact your quality of life , so you need to rely on local government and society to regulate that person 's behavior ( noise ordinances ) . In both cases , whether trying to get help or prevent other people from negatively impacting you , government has the power to make your life a lot better because you and all your fellow city dwellers are concentrated in one place . Compare this to the rural lifestyle . Your nearest neighbor might be 10 minutes away by car . In this case , you would regard a noise ordinance as anything but helpful . Your neighbor could n't buy speakers loud enough to bother you , so of course you 'd take umbrage to some cop hanging around your property line telling you to turn your music down all the time when it hurts no one . Similarly , government benefits are of reduced value to you . The average area that must be covered by the local fire department might be hundreds of times bigger than your average city precinct . Even if you do call for help , logistically , you realize it could be a long time until they get there . So naturally it does n't make a whole lot of sense to rely a lot on government services that require you to be relatively close . All of this adds up to : rural areas tend to be more self - reliant and mistrusting of government , while urban populations tend to be willing to rely much more heavily on government services and regulation . But : * * only when locality matters . * * What does that mean ? Well , note that rural areas are perfectly happy to rely on government services when those services can be rendered at a distance . For instance , farm aid . Washington DC can cut a check from thousands of miles away to help a farmer grow crops . In these cases , rural areas tend to like government regulation when it benefits them . So what \" big govt / small govt \" is really about is which population is better able to extract utility from government . This is why Republicans tend to favor government involvement in things like farm aid even though that 's inconsistent with their \" small govt \" core message .",
        "DRYAD PROGRAM PROPOSAL Dear Oxygen Crisis Advisory Committee, With almost all the trees gone after a horrific blight swept the globe, oxygen content in the atmosphere has begun to decrease dramatically. Of course, \"dramatically\" on paper only looks like a few tenths of a percent every year, but it has become clear that within a couple of decades the atmosphere's oxygen content will drop below breathable levels. This information has been kept private from the general public, but ultimately this confidentiality will be untenable. With other planets settled in nearby star systems, an evacuation of Earth was proposed. This avenue has been explored briefly but the potential cost was far more than any government or benefactor is willing to provide. We propose an alternative, reversed option: bringing new life to Earth. There is plant life on nearby planets that shows a promising ability to spread and repopulate at an enormous rate, and it could easily replace the long-gone trees of Earth. This option is limited by time, but it is the only option available that we can think of. The most viable tree-like lifeforms for transplant exist on Alpha Centauri Bb, called dryads by the astrobiologists studying them. Despite their viability, they have an unfortunate life-cycle: they bask in the sun during the day, showing off their beautiful flowers, but when the night falls they begin to hunt. Dryads are carnivorous plants, much like Venus flytraps, and they seek their food while the other life on their planet is sleeping. They will grab hold of any unsheltered animal life and drag it into their roots, before sitting on that food and digesting it over the next day. Obviously, this presents a danger to the American and global public. Given the urgency of the situation, we recommend that this danger be accommodated rather than rejected. We propose that with the introduction of the dryads into the American wilderness, a curfew be imposed on civilians for their safety. We recommend that civilians remain within their homes from sunset until sunrise each night until oxygen levels are replenished and the dryads may be replaced with a suitable artificial plant such as those proposed by [ REDACTED ]. We understand that this proposal will exact a great cost on the nation, both economically and psychologically. It is, as we have said, the only option presently available. We trust that the OCAC will make the correct and wisest choice for the American people. Sincerely, [ REDACTED ] - Read more at rUnloquacious!",
        "I 'm sure a physicist or electrical engineer can do a better job of this than I can , but since I 'm the first comment here I 'll do my best . Imagine an analogy to water flowing through a pipe . In our analogy electrons flow through a wire similar to water flowing through a pipe . Its not exactly the same in real life , but its similar in alot of ways and will help to explain . A coulomb is a unit measuring the amount of electrical \" charge \" . The analogy to water breaks down a little with this , but you can think of charge as being a little bit like mass . Its how much \" stuff \" is there , except mass is the \" stuff \" that matters for gravity and charge is the \" stuff \" that matters for electricity . Current is the flow rate through the pipe . Its how much water ( electrons ) flow through a certain cross section of the pipe in a given amount of time . In electricity we use the unit Amperes to measure current . The unit of Amperes is equivalent to coulombs / second . Voltage is like the pressure of the water in the pipe . Its how \" forceful \" the current pushes through the pipe . Resistance is a bit like friction from the pipe itself . Its how hard it is to push water ( electrons ) through the pipe . an important equation relating these quantities is Ohm 's Law , which states Voltage = Current * Resistance . This mathematical relation describes the behavior of electricity in simple circuits and is very fundamental to the physics of electrical circuits . in English you can think of this as meaning \" the pressure in the pipe is proportional to the rate of flow times the friction of the pipe \" . Watts is actually not directly related to electricity . that is a unit of what is called \" power \" in physics , which is a way of measuring energy expended over time . Electrical currents are capable of doing work so many electrical devices have a Wattage number listed to explain how much energy the device uses to do its work . AC means alternating current . DC means direct current . these both refer to methods of transmitting electricity over a distance . DC is almost exactly the same as the way you typically think of water flowing through a pipe . AC transmits by waves instead . Imagine a bathtub full of water . You dunk your hand at one end of the bathtub and it sends a wave of water travelling across the tub until it reaches the other sides , where it does some work at a distant device . That is what alternating current is like ( sort of ) .",
        "Around the galaxy, citizens from across the empire hunched eagerly around their ansibles. The anticipation was palpable throughout the Civil Zone. School districts were shut down and businesses closed their doors. On the only holiday that the entirety of the Unified Systems participated in together, a sense of expectancy for this moment had permeated the entire week. In the High Palace of Gallacia, Chief Advisor Barant stood, tall and astute, on the central platform of the Hall off Maps, examining a detailed hologram of the galaxy overhead. His suit was pristine, the opalescent fabric shifting colors in the dim light of the hall. Around the edge of the room, rows and row of Navigators sat at their controls, guiding the pods of seekers that troved across the galaxy, searching for the telltale signature of the Empire's Will. Barant watched the hologram expectantly, patiently. One by one, planets and star systems changed from white to red, signifying that the Empire's Will had not been found. Thirty-nine days ago, Empress Ambellina passed away in her sleep, peacefully and painlessly. A beloved leader, Barant was heartbroken when he learned of the Empress' passing. He had been Ambellina's most-trusted advisor from the start, nearly two centuries before. And now, as history dictates, the Empire's Will would choose a new host precisely thirty-nine solar cycles after leaving the old one. The Unified Systems spanned across the majority of the galaxy, and while there were independent races that existed elsewhere, nobody in the Ferals had been chosen in over 6000 years. And so Barant waited. The entirety of the Systems waited. One by one the star systems blinked red. Hours dragged by lazily as the possibilities narrowed, the bright red stretching across the holomap little by little. Barant began to grow nervous, shifting from foot to foot to foot impatiently. Had they started the search too early? Was there a gap in the web of seeker pods that scoured the galaxy? The people were waiting! They needed their leader! The Empress had been a symbol of peace of progress in a time when the galaxy needed somebody like her the most. Even in the thirty-nine days since her death cracks in the foundation began to grow. The holomap pinged. Barant looked up from his news panel, terrified of what he would see. A green dot pulsed. In the Ferals. Planet CB993. Earth, the den of Humankind. Barant's cool demeanor shattered, a terrifying shout of rage and horror erupting from his lips.",
        "For the last six months my wife and I had been worried sick. If we didn't find enough food soon there was no way that she, myself and more importantly our child would survive the winter. After the third phase we guessed that there was less than 1,000 survivors, considering that we hadn't come across anyone for years and years. The first ten years after it ended had gone by slowly, a haze, we as a race had returned to our hunter gather phase. My wife and I collected as much paper as we could and wrote down as much as we could. WE collected as many books as we could find. We crammed as much information as we could into our bunker. The next five years we spent cramming up on food. We got as much as we could, but then she got pregnant and we knew it wasn't enough. At first we kicked ourselves for our mistake. How could we be so careless. Then we realized that what we had done was actually a beautiful thing. We could resurrect our species, humanity could survive. My wife and I agreed eventually we could find someone else in the world, hopefully they would have made the same beautiful mistake we had. All that information we had though, and there was one more thing I wanted to write. The wind beat my face and caked on layer upon layer of sand. I flipped over the aluminum trash can lid that I had been staring at for twenty minutes. This was likely my last hope and it was a small one. There, however, in all its irony was the piece of trash I had been searching for. Paper. I took the half melted pen in my hand and began. This may be the last scrap of paper on the planet. I was so glad that I found it I cried for hours, but that probably isn't the reason I'm crying. Son when you finally read this I want you to know that your mother and I did everything with you in mind. You need to know our story, but not from a scrap of paper. Your mother will tell you all you need to know. I love you. Have a good life son. I started my walk back home and began thinking of all the wonderful things my son would accomplish. He may be president one day, considering there won't be to many other candidates. I left my note with my wife and kissed her hard on the lips then kissed my son on the forehead. I climbed up the later and out the hatch. I reached in my pocket and pulled out my salvation, and more importantly my son's. The cold steel felt good on my forehead. I smiled and saved my son.",
        "At the end of his speech launching the party's manifesto, Mike Nesbitt said: \"Domination doesn't work, partnership does.\" Ulster Unionists want the election to be a referendum on how the Renewable Heat Incentive debacle was handled. But the focus has now turned on them following Mr Nesbitt's comments. Mr Nesbitt was asked about the decision of his senior party colleague Danny Kennedy to publicly distance himself from the remarks. He turned to Mr Kennedy, who was sitting behind him on the platform, and said: \"It wasn't disappointing, it was actually quite reaffirming to know Danny was listening.\" The line brought laughter from other candidates and party members. Under questioning from journalists, Mr Nesbitt denied that he had any regrets or that he had made a mistake. \"What I have said consistently is vote Ulster Unionists and then for any candidate that you believe will do the right thing within your community, within your constituency and within the country,\" he said. He added that he \"wouldn't withdraw a word\" of what he had said and was thinking only of what what would happen after the election. \"The fact is, if we are going into [Stormont] Castle, it will be with a nationalist party,\" he said. \"Now, would I rather go in with Sinn Fein or the SDLP? I would rather go in with the SDLP.\" Mr Nesbitt went on to say that, on Monday, he spent a lot of time time knocking doors in heavily unionist areas with \"very little criticism and a lot of support for what I was talking about.\" \"I am confident in my position and I'm very confident and relaxed that [candidates] behind me are taking different positions in terms of vote transfer,\" he said. \"But people will come back on 2 March to thinking about the PS85,000 a day that is going up in smoke, the 10 years of the DUP and Sin Fein in that castle and the impossibility, no matter what anybody writes in a platform piece for the newspaper, of leopards changing their spots.\" The manifesto, entitled'Real Partnership', includes calls for action in tackling waiting lists, increasing PSNI numbers to 7,500, prioritising the York Street interchange, standing up for the LGBT community and \"guaranteeing\" that no group is worse off because of Brexit. In a section entitled'Cleaning Up Stormont', the party calls for: On the theme of the election being a referendum, he said it was about \"incompetence, arrogance, cronyism and the strong whiff of corruption.\" He must hope that message will resonate more strongly than the continuing controversy over his remarks about transferring to the SDLP.",
        "View changed I have three problems with the Snowden matter. 1.Everywhere I hear people saying Snowden is a hero and shouldn't be punished. I don't care if people treat him like a hero, but all the arguments against his punishment are very subjective. The reason is because they are based on morals. The most common argument for his freedom is that he did a good deed. My question is why was his deed good? Maybe because it made people free, happy or whatever. But why is that something good then? What is good and what is bad must be predefined to go with that argument, but it isn't. I come to the conclusion that the only reason he should be free is based on something subjective (as I said before). Yet the deal he made is something absolute, because it doesn't matter if the deal is good or bad. They simply predefined what would happen in what scnario of the deal. If he keeps his mouth shut he gets money, if he doesn't he gets punished. 2.If he doesn't get punished it will encourage other whitleblowers to follow in his footsteps (one thing that Snowden wants to achieve too). Yet it isn't allways good for everybody to have every single piece of information. For example and I know how hypothetical this is, but imagine a room with 100 people in it, who all gaze in aw at a big screen (the important thing is that they're not moving). One of them knows of tripwires connected to a nuclear bomb everywhere in the room. He can try to disable the tripwires by himself, or tell everybody about them. If he tells everybody, chances are everybody will panic and trigger the bomb. Their knowing of the threat would be inefficient for their own survival. 3.I do not understand why the government having our private digital information is such a big problem. There is no reason for anybody ever to look at your information. You are uninteresting for the people granted access to said information, except if you are a threat to other people. In that case it would, I believe, be the general opinion to be good for authorities having access to your information, to be able to stop you. Point 3 doesn't say anything on the matter of the punishment but I feel it belongs to this topic. I also feel that ither my opinion is underrepresentated or has a big flaw which I can't find. So please reddit get the discussion going and try to change my view.",
        "So the humanoids on the planets closest to stars would be dark skinned, tough, adept at surviving in harsh hot climates and living off very little water, hunts what little fauna there might be on their planets - for desert planets closest to stars, this might mean lizards and such, whereas for slightly milder jungle planets there might be a little more choice. The humanoids on the dry, arid planets suffering the worst from proximity to their sun would be nomadic, travelling far across the planet to stay as far away from the burning sun-facing side. These warmer humanoids I imagine being more primitive than their counterparts further out in their respective systems, as they spend more time focussing on their own survival than advancement of technology. The safe zone inhabitants would have it easier. The ones nestled right in the middle of the optimal habitable area would be the most advanced and able to explore other parts of the universe, whereas the colder climates at the edge of solar systems are home to thicker skinned, hairy neanderthal-type humanoids hunting mammoth mammals and other ice dwelling beasts, and the cold climate and distance from the sun makes it difficult to successfully leave the planet, as their is little solar wind and air currents on these planets aren't very strong. I'm literally making science up here, it's like being back in school. Perhaps in solar systems, or on a wider basis galaxies, are experiencing convergentdivergent evolution, in that the primitive species on each planet is similar to others but more adapted to their particular environment, as described above. This lends nicely into the god theory put forward elsewhere, in that the universe was engineered, and maybe a few base life forms were spread wide as a basis for evolution to take hold. Perhaps different systemsgalaxies are divided by vast gaps, where the air is so thin and the air is so cold that only highly advanced civilisations would be able to muster the speedtechnology to get across successfully without suffocating, freezing or starving. Within each system different base life forms were evolved from, so there is a wider difference in species traits. So, say, within system a bunch of humanoids eventually advance enough to leave and meet their counterparts on other planets, and are not so unnerved by similar looking beings, but later on when further travel is available, and the harsher parts of the void can be traversed, completely new sentient species are chanced upon and the reaction is much different to the in-system meetings. Just my thoughts, could definitely be improved upon.",
        "Translated from original French: Dear future reader: I wonder who you are. I have no way of knowing where this letter will go, or who will read it. Indeed, there's a chance that you won't even understand what this is and throw it out. But on the off chance that you are reading this, that you can understand me - Hello. My name is Gerald Lambert. I was born in Paris to a wealthy merchant and his lovely wife. Out of 5 children, I was the only one to survive childhood. I suppose that made me special to them. [ A large section of ruined writing and running ink ] anged when the draft came. \"Fight for honor! For your country! For brotherhood!\" Honor. Such a stupid thing to fight for, honor. But I didn't know that at the time. I was swept up with the others, carried away in a whirlwind of pride and patriotism and misplaced trust in my superiors. All that was shattered on my first day in the trenches. The Germans were relentless. They took position after position, town after town. I hated them. Some nights I would dream of killing thousands of Germans - just me and the company machine gun. About a month after I first stepped into the trenches, our commander ordered us to fire into the backs of retreating Germans. At the time, I did it without hesitation. I think I killed 5 of them that day. I was exhilarated. But that night, I had a terrible dream. I stood in a field of a thousand graves, each unmarked. Some were decorated with German colours, some Austrian, and some French. And it was quiet - dreadfully quiet. I stood among the graves of these dead soldiers and asked aloud if honour mattered. The silence was my answer. I suppose, then I realized that this was not a fight of honour. This was slaughter - meaningless death. And I resolved to take no part in it. I missed on purpose. I stayed back on charges. I purposely let some Germans go when I was on watch. But now, as I lay in this disgusting shell hole dying of blood loss, I know all my efforts were for nothing. My comrades are still fighting, dying. The Germans, too. All around me, I can hear the screams. The ocean is nearby, beautiful and stoic. I think I'll toss this message there, to be lost to the waves. I only have one request, dear reader. Never let this happen again.",

        "First of all, I think I'll clear off some confusion in the topic. The Sterling Ratio is a very simple investment portfolio measurement that fits nicely to the topic of personal finance, although not so much to a foreign exchange trading system. The Sterling Ratio is mainly used in the context of hedge funds to measure its risk-reward ratio for long term investments. To do so, it has been adapted to the following in order to appear more like the Sharpe Ratio:  I Suppose this is why you question the Average Largest Draw-down. I'll come back to that later. It's original definition, suggested by the company Deane Sterling Jones, is a little different and perhaps the one you should use if you want to measure your trading system's long term risk-reward ratio, which is as followed:  Note: Average Annual Draw-down has to be negative on the above-mentioned formula. This one is very simple to calculate and the one to use if you want to measure any portfolio's long-term results, such an example of a 5 or 10 years period and calculate the average of each years largest drawdown. To answer @Dheer's comment, this specific measurement can also be used in personal investments portfolio, which is considered a topic related to personal finance. Back to the first one, which answers your question. It's used in most cases in investment strategies, such as hedging, not trading systems. By hedging I mean that in these cases long term investments are made in anti-correlated securities to obtain a diversified portfolio with a very stable growth. This one is calculated normally annually because you rely on the Annual Risk-Free Rate. Having that in mind I think you can guess that the Average Largest Drawdown is the average between the Largest/Maximum Drawdown from each security in the portfolio. And this doesn't make sense in a trading system. Example: If you have invested in 5 different securities where we calculated the Largest Draw-down for each, such as represented in the following array: MaxDD[5] = { 0.12, 0.23, 0.06, 0.36, 0.09 }, in this case your Average Largest Draw-down is the average(MaxDD) that equals 0.172 or 17,2% If your portfolio's annual return is 15% and the Risk-free Rate is 10%, your Sterling Ratio SR = (0.15 - 0.10)/0.172, which result to 0.29. The higher the rate better is the risk-reward ratio of your portfolio. I suggest in your case to only use the original Sterling Ratio to calculate your long-term risk-reward, in any other case I suggest looking at the Sharpe and Sortino ratios instead.",
        "In mathematics, a Markov decision process (MDP) is a discrete-time stochastic control process. It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. MDPs are useful for studying optimization problems solved via dynamic programming. MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s; a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard's 1960 book, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes. They are used in many disciplines, including robotics, automatic control, economics and manufacturing. The name of MDPs comes from the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov as they are an extension of Markov chains.\nAt each time step, the process is in some state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n, and the decision maker may choose any action \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n that is available in state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n. The process responds at the next time step by randomly moving into a new state \n\n\n\n\ns\n′\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n, and giving the decision maker a corresponding reward \n\n\n\n\nR\n\na\n\n\n(\ns\n,\n\ns\n′\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R_{a}(s,s')}\n\n.\nThe probability that the process moves into its new state \n\n\n\n\ns\n′\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n is influenced by the chosen action. Specifically, it is given by the state transition function \n\n\n\n\nP\n\na\n\n\n(\ns\n,\n\ns\n′\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{a}(s,s')}\n\n. Thus, the next state \n\n\n\n\ns\n′\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n depends on the current state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n and the decision maker's action \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n. But given \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n and \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, it is conditionally independent of all previous states and actions; in other words, the state transitions of an MDP satisfy the Markov property.\nMarkov decision processes are an extension of Markov chains; the difference is the addition of actions (allowing choice) and rewards (giving motivation). Conversely, if only one action exists for each state (e.g. \"wait\") and all rewards are the same (e.g. \"zero\"), a Markov decision process reduces to a Markov chain.",
        "Shallow. That was the word, shallow; exactly Jenny, spot on. Shallow. \" ..... and those shorts! Did he really expect a second...\" The pen he held in his hand, the yellow one with the smiley face on the clicker that he liked so much, scrawled across the blank slate before him scratchily. It filled in boxes and lines, wrote important memos (at least to him), and even signed mail deliveries now and then. But right now, as he listened to a customer complaint in one ear and eavesdropped on Jenny in the other, it was drawing. \"WHERE is the tiny snow globe gift at? It was supposed to come FREE!\" Shouted the customer. He was right, of course. It was supposed to come free. But, according to the higher ups, no globes were coming to any of the customers. At least, not until five to ten business weeks. But how to stylize the other'L'? Sans font of some kind..? \"Of course, sir. The snow globe is our free gift to you, but \"Whaddya mean, BUT?!\" Interrupted the customer. \"Well, if you'd like I could get you the manager to explain sir?\" He said, trying to pass the buck. Smiley face clicked up and down ferociously as he waited for an answer. \"Yeah, I want to speak to your manager about this, Gerome!\" Spat the customer as if it were his idea. \"Transferring you now. Have a good day.\" He said as politely as he could. It wasn't Gerome, it was Gerald. Maybe if it were Gerome, more people would remember his name..... Clicking over to the next line he began his spiel again: \"Customer Service, how may I help you?\" He would say. \"I have a problem.\" They would say. He would begin to draw again. \"What is your problem?\" He would say. \"Its my order. There's no snow globe.\" They would say. His desk would creak as his knee started jerking nervously. \"Oh?\" He would say, mock-questioningly. \"Yes. So WHERE is it?\" They would begin. Jenny was bitching about how shallow she was again.

Sure she's blonde but How to stylize the'O'..? \"Where's my SNOW GLOBE!\" The customer screamed. \"Well, you see...\" Might have went a bit off topic.",
        "So I wasn't planning on staying over in Phoenix last night but decided to squeeze in a business dinner only to find that nearly every hotel on Scottsdale Road from Camelback to Shea was booked. I called the Montelucia and a very nice lady at a central reservation place set me up and told me the rate was 249. More than I wanted to spend but, since it was 10:00pm and I was tired, I went with it. I was greeted by a friendly valet who informed me that there was a 19day valet fee. Are you freakin' kidding me I exclaimed to which he apologetically responded that I was welcome to park the car myself. Enter the lobby.... I am greeted by an impeccably dressed gentleman who quickly finds my reservation and tells me about the 24 resort fee which covers the pool, internet and parking. So does the resort fee include the valet parking I asked? No, it only includes self parking he responded. Are you freakin' kidding me I exclaimed (again). He then offered to have the valet come up and bring my car back so that I could self-park it if I wanted. At this point, I started my rant. You people must be high, and I don't mean your prices, seriously..... on a 249 room, you expect me to pay an additional 43 for the use of the pool, internet and the privilege of parking my own car - all of which is taxable at monster bed tax rates? Just give me the key and tell me where my room is. I was shown a map of the grounds and the directions to my room were circuitous, requiring walking through an outside lounge. I asked if a bellman could take me. Of course sir, a bellman can take you in a golf cart if you just step outside by the fountain. I walk out to the fountain with my bag and wait for about a minute, but no bellman. I yell over to the 2 guys behind the valet desk (both of whom know I have been standing there), can one of you take me to my room? Well sir, the bellman will be back in about 5 minutes but you can walk to your room in less than 5 minutes. Seriously? You want me to walk across the property (outside) in the dark for 5 minutes, through the seating area of a restaurant lounge, around the pool area. You guys don't have another golf cart? Sorry sir.... The one star above was for the nicely appointed room. At checkout, I found that I had been charged 15.99 for internet service that was supposed to be included in the resort fee. The charge was promptly reversed. This experience is actually going to motivate me to write a letter to the management of the hotel (which I have NEVER done before). I wonder if they offer me a complimentary stay, if I will still need to pay the resort fee?",
        "Yes I'm an American male, and I don't know how things differ for women or those outside the United States, so I'll leave those two large groups out of the discussion. For any given American male, I believe the chances are less (possibly way less) than 50 that he will at some point in his life have a sexual encounter that truly fulfills his fantasies. I think this is due to a combination of factors, that when taken together hurt his chances greatly: 1) Most mainstream media (movies, TV, magazines, websites, porn, etc.) focuses on very attractive women (and men). Most people (maybe 80-90) don't get anywhere near those standards. Yet the media offers what becomes, in many cases, the yardstick by which we judge attractiveness. This means the pool of attractive potential partners becomes smaller both for the guy and for those he has an interest in. 2) Many if not most men watch porn, and a lot (though certainly not all) of it glorifies unrealistic or demeaning things done to (generally) attractive people who are paid to do it and to act like they enjoy it whether they really do or not. A ludicrous amount of free porn is available to most people, usually from a young age, and much easier to access than an actual partner. 3) Lots of food, sedentary lifestyles, increasing obesity. This ties in with 1, in that we're taught that obesity is unattractive, yet people are getting fatter because of.... lots of things, but we'll just say food is a business that's very heavily marketed to us, and usually not to keep people in good physical form. I think this is a recipe for fat, porn-addicted dudes who dream of boning the hottest of the hot in ways that most self-respecting people would refuse. I'm sure some guys are lucky enough to have a truly gratifying experience with another person, but I think the majority will have to settle for something less than what they dream of.

        "When I first received my superpower, I was told that I would probably regret it. What did I care, though? I was the one person chosen out of the 5 million or so that entered the sweepstakes to get a superpower. I guess the whole sweepstakes to win a superpower should have tipped me off, but like I said, what did I care? Well..... I should have. The superpower I chose was telekinesis. The power to manipulate objects and their kinetic energy. In essence, it's like I have several different powers. Flight, super speed, super strength, and a few others that are less impressive. I didn't realize, however, the excruciating pain that would come with it. I haven't actually been able to move since I got my powers. I've been stuck in some plain white room, hooked up to IVs and pain medicine (which doesn't help). Also, the pain is far too great for me to focus long to put my powers to use. I may as well be dead. It would actually be preferable to what my life is like now. Not only am I in constant pain, I have no memories. I have no idea who I am. The memories I do have are completely useless. The memory of that sweepstakes? Useless. All that does is give me an indescribable feeling of regret. Occasionally some man in a lab coat will come in to look at my vitals. I always ask him questions about who I was, but the only he has ever told me is that I had a wife and children. Unfortunately, I can't remember them. I think forgetting about them, if they're even real, is probably worse than the pain. Real. That's a funny word. I don't know, maybe none of this is real.

        "Good horror movies from France are quite rare, and it's fairly easy to see why! Whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a staggering new film, he emigrates towards glorious Hollywood immediately after to directed the big-budgeted remake of another great film classic! How can France possibly build up a solid horror reputation when their prodigy-directors leave the country after just one film? \"Haute Tension\" was a fantastic movie and it earned director Alexandre Aja a (one-way?) ticket to the States to remake \"The Hills Have Eyes\" (which he did terrifically, I may add). Eric Valette's long-feature debut \"Maléfique\" was a very promising and engaging horror picture too, and he's already off to the Hollywood as well to direct the remake of Takashi Miike's ghost-story hit \"One Missed Call\". So there you have it, two very gifted Frenchmen that aren't likely to make any more film in their native country some time soon. \"Maléfique\" is a simple but efficient chiller that requires some patience due to its slow start, but once the plot properly develops, it offers great atmospheric tension and a handful of marvelous special effects. The film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters. We're inside a ramshackle French prison cell with four occupants. The new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud, the elderly and \"wise\" inmate sadistically killed his wife and then there's a crazy transvestite and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd foursome. They find an ancient journal inside the wall of their cell, belonging to a sick murderer in the 1920's who specialized in black magic rites and supernatural ways to escape. The four inmates begin to prepare their own escaping plan using the bizarre formulas of the book, only to realize the occult is something you shouldn't mess with Eric Valette dedicates oceans of time to the character drawings of the four protagonists, which occasionally results in redundant and tedious sub plots, but his reasons for this all become clear in the gruesome climax when the book suddenly turns out to be some type of Wishmaster-device. \"Maléfique\" is a dark film, with truckloads of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior. Watch it before some wealthy American production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals.",
        "The system is being based on the way people fill up their car with petrol or buy data bundles with a mobile phone. The company says it is an attempt to simplify energy bills. ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: \"We're saying to people buy it by the day, not by kilowatts or a fancy tariff you don't understand.\" Customers will use an app that has a gauge measuring consumption. The company will tailor each customer's \"day\" based on a personalised forecast of how much energy they typically use. This will also vary according to the time of year. Customers will be able to buy packages of gas and electricity in quantities from one day to a month, and up to 180 days ahead. The firm has been piloting the scheme and it says it could transform the way consumers buy energy. Mr Anderson said they went back to scratch and looked at how people bought petrol for their car. \"You go to the garage and put PS50 in your car. Inherently you know that will last you two to three weeks. \"We thought why don't we do the same thing with energy.\" A fuel gauge supplied within the app will then tell customers how much energy they are using and how much they have left. Under the scheme, called \"PowerUp,\" customers will not have to pay a standing charge. Scottish Power said its tariffs for the scheme would include some of the firm's most competitive prices. It will be launched to existing customers initially, and the company firm will then consider whether to open it up to the wider market. A two-year investigation into the energy industry by the competition authorities found that many consumers were not engaged in the energy market and failed to switch to the cheapest deals. The new approach to buying energy has been welcomed by the industry regulator. In a statement, Ofgem said: \"We want more competition to increase choice and drive down prices for consumers. \"We encourage suppliers to offer new innovative tariffs to help people engage in the market and find the best deal which suits them. \"Innovative tariffs can be tailored to an individual consumer's needs and give people more control over their energy bill and how they pay for it.\" Claire Osborne, energy expert for Uswitch.com said: \"Energy bills are notoriously difficult to understand and so this approach, similar to how we buy petrol, should help consumers use less, waste less and pay less for their gas and electricity. \"The fact that the deal has no standing charge will be attractive to many customers - particularly those with second homes which are unoccupied for part of the year - as there's nothing to pay on days when no energy is used.\"",
        "The plans would allow victims to ask for a case to be reviewed when police identified a suspect but did not pass a file to the Crown Prosecution Service. The policy would begin with rape and child sexual exploitation cases. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it was time to \"put victims in the driving seat.\" The CPS already has a right to review scheme in place, where victims can request a review of their case if it is dropped by prosecutors before reaching the courtroom. Labour said it intended to extend this to decisions by the police. Ms Cooper said: \"Rape and child sexual exploitation are vile crimes that ruin lives and destroy families. \"Too often victims and survivors aren't listened to and aren't heard, especially children. \"And although reports to the police have gone up, arrests and prosecutions have gone down. \"But right now if the police decide not to pursue a crime, there is little more victims or their families can do. That's not good enough. \"We'll change the law so that if the police decide to drop a case after a suspect has been identified, victims will have a new right to challenge their decision. \"It's time to change the culture, stop these awful crimes being hidden away and put victims in the driving seat.\" Main pledges Labour said that of 16,300 complaints of rape made to the police in England and Wales in 2012-13, 5,400 were passed to the CPS. The party said a decision to drop a case when a suspect had been identified would follow the process used by the CPS, of local resolution followed by independent review. Under the plans, the decision to drop the case would be first be checked by a prosecutor who has not been involved with the case previously. Labour said it would ensure victims were provided with a clear and detailed explanation of the decision and the local resolution would normally be completed within 10 days of the receipt of a request for review. If the victim were not satisfied with the local resolution, the decision would be independently reviewed by another prosecutor. Former Thames Valley Chief Constable and head of the National Policing Improvement Agency, Peter Neyroud, said: \"It is critical that victims have a right to review decisions all the way from the duty to record and allegation, through to decisions on whether to pursue a prosecution. \"Not only does this put the spotlight of accountability on the police, but it also gives the victim an important additional opportunity to influence their case and understand the decisions. \"Sometimes this will encourage a fresh angle to the case; sometimes there will be no new avenues. But there should always be a full and frank explanation of the steps taken to bring an offender to justice and the rationale for police decision.\"",
        "The 58-year-old school principal from Dublin won 144 out of a possible 278 votes and was 98 ahead of his nearest rivals Sean Walsh and Frank Burke. Horan will take over from current president Aogan O Fearghail in 2018. \"Aogan is the president for the next 12 months so I'll support him and learn from him as best I can,\" said Horan at Croke Park. The other candidates for the post were Martin Skelly with 22 votes while 20 went to Robert Frost. This weekend's annual congress will be dominated by new championship proposals in football and hurling. The plans put forward by GAA director general Paraic Duffy include completing the All-Ireland Senior Championships by the end of August. Also included is a new round-robin format for the All-Ireland SFC quarter-finals, which would mean more games. This proposal has proved particularly controversial in recent weeks. Both the Gaelic Players' Association and recently formed Club Players' Association have come out against Duffy's plans, although not necessarily for the same reasons. Ostensibly, the main reason for these mooted changes is to try and ensure more regular games for club players but there is a certain amount of bafflement as to how this can be squared with the motion to have a round-robin stage in the All-Ireland Football quarter-finals. The new club players' body has been angered after the GAA's top brass refused to grant it a speaking platform at the Croke Park gathering. However, that may change at further annual gatherings of GAA delegates if a motion for the club players' body to be officially recognised is passed in Dublin. All the indications are that the votes on both the so-called new'Super Eight football round' and the proposal to bring forward the All-Ireland finals will be exceptionally close, with a two-thirds' majority required for the format changes to be tried for a three-year period. To make matters even complicated, congress will also hear a number of motions calls from the two-thirds majority to be scrapped, with one call suggestion a simple majority and another calling for the figure to be lowered to 60. Inevitably, those motions will require a two-thirds majority to be passed. Going into the weekend, Croke Park's desire for replays to be scrapped - in favour of extra-time - in all championship games bar provincial and All-Ireland finals looks likely to be comfortably passed. At last year's congress, motions to move All-Ireland Finals to earlier in the year and scrap replays were both defeated, although the finals proposal fell narrowly short after getting support from 60.8 of delegates.",
        "Users of the popular Miaopai and Sina Weibo social networks are commenting on how moved they are by the decision of Bai Yan, a 55-year-old police dog handler, to create a special home specifically for service industry dogs. The latest video about the home, by Kankan News, features Little Dragon, a sparky 10-year-old German Shepherd, and has been viewed more than 14.7 million times on video platform Miaopai, where over 9,000 users have commented. Thousands more have also commented via the Sina Weibo microblog. Mr Bai has spent seven years and more than one million yuan (150,000; PS117,000) on the resort, which is in a spacious mountainous region of Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province. It has assault courses and long walking paths for the dogs. There is also a cemetery at the site, where 26 of Bai's former \"comrades\" are buried. In an interview with local paper Qianjiang Evening News in June, Mr Bai explained the reason for setting up the home. He said it was largely because he didn't want to take the simple route of euthanising one of his dogs, Sonny, after the elderly Alsatian contracted skin cancer. Mr Bai claimed that rather than following vets' advice and having the animal put to sleep, he spent time giving daily medicinal baths to bring Sonny's illness under control. After that experience, he said he reached an understanding that retired dogs, much as humans, \"need daily care.\" Mr Bai has been a police dog handler since 2004, and has trained over 30 police dogs. Currently, 16 of his former dogs are residents at the retirement home. \"They have accompanied me for over 10 years; you could say they are my work comrades, or even my family,\" he told local media in June. Responding to the latest video, Sino Weibo user Pinxieyougong says Mr Bai is \"worth our admiration. We should see more of this [behaviour] across the nation,\" she adds, \"After all, these dogs are civil servants.\" Other users agree, calling the dogs \"national heroes.\" One user says they \"should be given a pension\" for the contributions they make to the country. In June, police dogs were widely praised for the support they provided after a landslide in southwest Sichuan province. They have also been credited in the country's media for helping find lost children. By Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring",
        "It was as if there were some thick lump of ice sitting in the back of my throat. I bit down had on my lips to keep a straight face, but the corner of my lips kept betraying my intentions at a moment's turn. The woman before me kept her composure far better than I could. Her tanned face gazed steadily onwards. There was no shaking in her hands. No panic in her eyes. She was not smiling. \"She was calm, sophisticated, the shining example of cool-headedness. I remember her words clearly. \"Remember, Johnny. Don't you smile. Whatever you do. Do not smile.\" The church was dimmer than it was on most Sunday nights. I had arrived at a mere six in the afternoon, but already the candles that kept the place lit bright into night were ablaze. The father turned to me and gave a knowing nod, reassuring me of our plans. He was a good man, that father. I was surprised when he agreed to help me out tonight. But, seeing him here, a familiar face in my current time, I'm glad enough to smile. I remember her words again, clear as a clean pool of lakewater. \"Do not smile.\" Father began to speak. First to the woman before me, to the woman I know as Abigail, to make sure she would be certain of our deal. She said yes, with a face as grave and serious as death, with all the grace and pride of a queen. Then, the father turned to me, to see if I was sure. First, I nodded. Then, she punched me. Then, I said yes. My lips turned white as my teeth bit down harder. My muscles ached to curve into the familiar feel of a joyful smile. I wanted to smile, more than anything. \"Do not smile,\" said Abigail. The words repeated into my ear. Father spoke a few words more. I couldn't hold it back any longer. It was too late. There, I stood, in the darkness of a Sunday evening, smiling the luckiest son of a bitch in the world. The woman before me saw her composure shatter. Her fair, strong arms shook ever so slightly. Her lips peeled back to make a face similar to mine. Her eyebrows defied the joy in her complexion, they showed irritation, incredulity, and furthermore, sheer dumbfoundery. I took her close into my arms, my smile a nose distance away from her's. Father said his last words. \"You may now kiss the bride.\" As I closed my eyes and drew in closer, all I remembered was that she had been smiling. And I had been smiling too.",
        "I loved this movie. I totally disagree with some (negative) critiques that I've read over the years. This was a great vehicle for Eddie Murphy! He appeared to have a great time with his part as Chandler Jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say, if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it! And, it WAS fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with Mr. Murphy's great comedic style. You have to keep in mind that 'Golden Child' is a 'fantasy' film  just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the 'real' world. During the time this film was released, I was working in a video rental store. This was one of the most popular with all our customers. Every single time, we put this one up on our monitor, ALL the copies we had went out fast with wait-list requests that kept it on the queue for months! Everyone who rented it loved it! I was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented  this was one of my favorites and I knew the taste of my customers so I highly recommended this one to most of them. I really feel that this film is a Sleeper  it may not have done too well at the box office  due to very poor marketing  but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later! (YES, I did buy this film for my own video library!). I adored the little boy who played the 'Golden Child'  J. L. Reate - but after looking at his profile in IMDb, I noticed that he never did any more films. That is sad, because he definitely had an on-screen aura and could have continued with a film career. I also adored Victor Wong, who played the Old Man (I LOVED him in his part as 'Egg Shen' in 'Big Trouble in Little China' - 1986). At any rate, this was a great film. The only drawbacks that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more 'adult' in nature  such as 'Chandler's rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette. It was funny, but it still was out of sync. OK, so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes  those were put in for the mind-set of the day perhaps. This was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from Hollywood. Now that's Entertainment!",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andre Mare along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in Du \"Cubisme,\" written during the assemblage of the \"Maison Cubiste,\" wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the \"antithesis of the picture.\" \"The true picture\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, \"bears its raison d'etre within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism....\" \"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence,\" writes Christopher Green, \"creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Leger and Roger La Fresnaye.\" La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room - the Salon Bourgeois, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (Woman with a Fan), Gleizes, Laurencin and Leger were hung - and a bedroom. It was an example of L'art decoratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston, listed in the catalogue of the New York exhibit as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, and entitled \"Facade architectural, plaster\" (Facade architecturale).",
        "Laurence eyed the newcomer closely as he stumbled toward the bar. Old, fat, unshaven and scarred, the stranger was already drunk. Laurence eyes narrowed seeing that the man wore a sword pommel of an officer of the Golden Swarm, the most renown of the Kingdom's forces. It was late and the tavern was empty save for the two. Laurence checked the underside of the counter for his dagger with his left hand while watching the man sit. \" A cup of alembic now! \" slurred the veteran. The veteran, Colm, had fought in a hundred battles against the dark elves during which he earned his scars. Of that he was proud, and his service had earned him a generous retirement. The pension however was now nearly spent on drink, on women, and on forgetting. This night he thought would be an end to all that, a night for old scores to be settled. \" You'll get no service, flashing that around here, \" Laurence gestured at Colm's sword. Colm straightened his back and asked in clear speech, \" Let me see your hand. \" After a pause he added, \" Please .\" Laurence knew what he was looking for. In his youth, when elves were just a children's tale, his province rebelled against the Kingdom's rule. The Golden Swarm was sent to put down the revolt. They were merciless their campaign to reunite the Kingdom. In a reprisal for some alleged treachery, the Swarm removed the forefingers of all the boys in Laurence's village. His village was known for its archers and Laurence was not spared. Nevertheless, he joined the rebels when he came of age and fought until the elves came. The elves cared not for human politics and attacked all sides. This ended the rebellion and the Kingdom united to fight the greater threat. Laurence clenched his left hand and displayed his crippled right. Colm sighed, \" You were there. I've never forgotten any of the boys I cut. My sword was the spring for rivers of elven blood but I can't picture any of their faces. I saw their foul magics desecrate the earth itself. Still, I can't forget is this damn village and what I had to do here all those years ago. \" \" So reach under that counter and grab that knife you keep feeling for and end it. Just give me a drink before you do. \" Laurence studied the old man across from him. He examined his sallow complexion and yellowing eyes. He looked nothing like his memories of the terrifying soldier with the knife who took his finger years ago. Slowly he turned away and poured a cup of alembic. \" Here. This will kill you soon enough. \"",
        "As a young man, I had foolishly believed that love could conquer all. Yes, such a feminine idea, but I was gay. I guess that shouldn't matter much, but it does play to this tune. When I was about twenty-seven, I met a man several years older than me. He was everything I wasn't: charming, soft-spoken, funny, attractive. It was no wonder that I fell for him as hard as I did. But it came as a shock to everyone, myself included, when he rejected me only twice before coming to my side one night, asking why I had stopped asking for his company. After several months, we had become inseparable. Two years later, we had handfasted. When gay marriage became legal two more years after that, we married. When he moved into my house, however, everything seemed to change. And it wasn't for the best. He became colder than ever, and was rarely home. When he was, he was either angry, or preoccupied most of the time. We rarely dined together, or shared a bed, or even spoke any more. I could not fathom why things had gone so sour so fast. So, I began to snoop. One day, finally, I found a book in a secret compartment in his writing desk. What I read, I couldn't believe. My lover, my husband, was trying to start a war between anthromorphs, vampires and djinn. I couldn't believe it. My husband had gone insane. And from the dates in the journal, it had been a long, slow progress. I was kicking myself for not seeing the signs sooner, for not seeing that the man I loved was in desperate need of help. I wanted to confront him, albeit gently, with my new knowledge, but I thought it would be safer if I followed him to one of his \"meetings\" to get video and audio evidence of whatever delusions he was suffering from. I could not believe my eyes when I saw the tall, dark figure approach him from the woods, only his eyes showing in the moonlight. Glowing a soft amber, his eyes seemed to see everything and nothing, all at once, without moving. He raised his head and sniffed, and looked right at me. The last thing I remember before this pain came over me are leering red eyes looming over me, closer and closer, and two small pricks against my jugular.",
        "The largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the Netherlands.The finished image is 2.5 billion pixels in size - making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras. The huge image of Delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the Dutch city taken at a fixed spot. If printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution, the picture would be 2.5m high and 6m long.The researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures. Tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. The website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200,000 visitors every day.The image was created by imaging experts from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.The goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November 2003. That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park, in Utah, and was made up of 196 separate photographs. The panorama of Delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in Mr Lyons' image. \"He did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image,\" said Jurgen den Hartog, one of the TNO researchers behind the project. \"We were not competing with Mr Lyons, but it started as a lunchtime bet.\"The Dutch team used already available technologies, although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image.\"We had to rewrite almost all the tools,\" Me den Hartog told the BBC News website. \"All standard Windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image, so we had to develop one ourselves.\" The 600 component pictures were taken on July 2004 by a computer-controlled camera with a 400 mm lens. Each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite. The stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful PCs over three days. Following the success of this project, and with promises of help from others, the TNO team is considering creating a full 360-degree panoramic view of another Dutch city, with even higher resolution.",
        "The thought of killing this mad man burned in my head. \"He must pay, his life is mine.\" I whispered to myself, though walking through these empty halls is making it seem like I'm shouting. \"It would be rather bothersome if he heard me coming.\" I thought. I quickened my pace as I drew my sword; The sound of Dothen being unsheathed always put a smile upon my face. The arching doorway at the end of this long hallway were growing larger as I hastily made my way toward it. \"YOU ARE MINE,\" I roared when I was a few feet away from the doorway. A large, brightly light room was on the other side of the doorway; The walls were covered with old, wooden shelves of books; Drapes of earthy colours filled the empty spaces on the walls. \"I have come to end your reign you dreaded creature.\" Said the so called, \"Warrior.\" He was nowhere to be seen. \"You can try,\" I replied, \"I will let you have a first strike, since I can not find you. coward!\" Suddenly, the hulking man jumped from behind the staircase to my left. He came from behind me, I managed to parry his attempted stab from his glimmering longsword. He turned and rushed at me again. I jumped to the side and stuck my foot out to trip him, stupid fool did not notice this and he fell flat on his face. I pounced on him to prevent escape, and held my dagger close to his thick throat. He struggled for a while, but it was entirely useless. \"You know you people can not win...\" He interrupted me with a spit to the face, \"You keep trying and trying, and you never win: never learn. So,\" I reached into my left breast pocket and pulled out a tiny vile of a dark, purple liquid. \"This will be VERY painful.\" I said as I put a tiny cut onto his throat, and poured the liquid onto the wound. I stood up and took a few steps back to watch. He jumped to his feet with a furious look plastered on his face. He ran at me, but only took a few steps before collapsing to the ground. He began to violently twitch, he was like a man gone mad. Foam began to spew from his hard, clenched mouth; Teeth were cracking and blood began to flow. I walked up to him, and kneeled down beside his flailing body. I grabbed him and held him steady, though it took a lot of strength. \"I will personally crucify each, and every one of your people. Starting with..... what's her name, Amealia.\" I laughed as I said this, and watched him scream a final scream, his eyes grew wide and stared directly into mine before they closed with the release of his spirit. I stood up and walked away with a smile of satisfaction.",
        "First off, you should contact your health plan administrator as soon as possible.  Different plans may interact differently with Medicare; any advice we could provide here would be tentative at best.  Some of the issues you may face: A person with both Medicare and a QHP would potentially have primary coverage from 2 sources: Medicare and the QHP. No federal law addresses this situation. Under state insurance law an individual generally cannot collect full benefits from each of 2 policies that together pay more than an insured event costs. State law usually specifies how insurance companies will coordinate health benefits when a person has primary coverage from more than one source. In that situation, insurance companies determine which coverage is primary and which is secondary. It’s important to understand that a QHP is not structured to pay secondary benefits, nor are the premiums calculated or adjusted for secondary payment. In addition, a person with Medicare would no longer receive any premium assistance or subsidies under the federal law. While previous federal law makes it illegal for insurance companies to knowingly sell coverage that duplicates Medicare’s coverage when someone is entitled to or enrolled in Medicare Part A or Part B, there has been no guidance on the issue of someone who already has individual health insurance and then also enrolls in Medicare. We and other consumer organizations have asked state and federal officials for clarification on this complicated situation. As such, it likely is up to the plan how they choose to pay - and I wouldn't expect them to pay much if they think they can avoid it.  You may also want to talk to someone at your local Medicare branch office - they may know more about your state specifically; or someone in your state's department of health/human services, or whomever administers the Exchanges (if it's not federal) in your state. Secondly, as far as enrolling for Part B, you should be aware that if she opts not to enroll in Part B at this time, if your wife later chooses to enroll before she turns 65 she will be required to pay a penalty of 10% per 12 month period she was not enrolled.  This will revert to 0 when she turns 65 and is then eligible under normal rules, but it will apply every year until then.  If she's enrolling during the normal General Enrollment period (Jan-March) then if she fails to enroll then she'll be required to pay that penalty if she later enrolls; if this is a Special Enrollment Period and extends beyond March, she may have the choice of enrolling next year without penalty.",
        "Inspectors criticised Darul Uloom school when they saw a \"female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room.\" But a statement from the school says the school did not segregate, but was respecting the governor's choice. A wave of Ofsted inspections found nine private faith schools \"inadequate.\" Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw had written on Tuesday to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan with the findings of inspections of 22 private faith schools, in cities including Manchester, Coventry, Birmingham and Leicester. These had formerly been inspected by an independent group - the Bridge Schools Inspectorate - but from this autumn Ofsted has taken over responsibility for carrying out checks. Religious studies GCSE'error of law' Inspectors raised concerns including that some of these private faith schools were not \"promoting fundamental British values\" and were not encouraging \"mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.\" They highlighted particular concern about Darul Uloom Islamic High School in Birmingham, where inspectors observed that \"the only female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room to the main meeting. \"As a result, she could only contribute to the meeting through a doorway. Governors told inspectors this was their usual arrangement. \"A senior HMI has pointed out to the school that this practice is unacceptable as it fails to show proper respect for women.\" In response, a statement from the school says that visitors, parents and governors can \"sit where and how they wish as they feel comfortable, and we never assert any restrictions on this.\" The private boys' schools says it has an \"open door policy\" and has hosted meetings including for a local faith forum and for the West Midlands police. The school issued a statement from the unnamed governor saying that \"my request to sit as I please\" was a way of \"demonstrating the school's strong promotion of both Islamic and British values.\" \"The right for a person to choose is a universal value,\" she said. But she claimed that the \"British values\" requirement was opposed to this. Darul Uloom, now rated as inadequate, had been inspected by Ofsted inspectors since 2011. In October 2013, Ofsted rated it as good and described the head teacher as \"forward thinking.\" Ofsted says that although its own inspectors carried out a number of inspections in recent years, the school was considered to have been part of the BSI inspection system. Among the 22 schools inspected 15 were Muslim and seven Christian. They had been part of a group of about 50 private schools which had been assessed by the Bridge Schools Inspectorate, which now is no longer approved to inspect schools. Among the 22 schools inspected by Ofsted, one was \"outstanding,\" four were rated \"good,\" eight were rated as \"requires improvement\" and nine were \"inadequate.\" Sir Michael's letter to the education secretary says it should be a priority to inspect other former Bridge Schools Inspectorate schools.",
        "A dull rumble vibrated the floor beneath my feet, and I could feel something happening. Finally. The lights had been out for almost an hour, and I had been in one of the most remote segments of the facility dropping off a package for Dr. Horz, one of the biotech R D gurus. I had been stumbling around for what felt like ages, but my watch did confirm that it was only 56 minutes. 56 minutes of noiseless terror. This particular R D facility of Tegra was filled with wonders, but it was very nearly empty. I was in my second week of interning, a lowly, aspiring electrical engineer. Thus far, I had done little more than grunt work with the odd bit of logic design. Mostly just documentation though. Endless documentation. The ground stopped trembling, and the lights slowly inked a light incandescence. The walls in front of me slowly illuminated, and I was peering at a tremendous vault. A vault door - to be specific. A vault door...which was slightly cracked open. The metallic alloy comprising its structure wasn't flush with the surrounding wall. And then the door started cracking open more. The noise was probably the most frightening thing. The grinding of gears and servos, attempting to hold the door shut, was echoing riotously throughout the small room. I started backing away slowly. I don't know where I am. I don't know what is behind that door, and I don't want to be here anymore. I take a large, decisive step towards the door, and I hear a different kind of rumble - a throaty rumble, from some thing. And then the door quite literally gave up its effort to hold whatever was within and sprang backwards, slamming into the wall. The darkness was wholly shrouding the space beyond. A deep, primal terror was creeping into every nook of my being. What the fuck is happening? And then I see it. Six or seven feet in the air, slowly apparating into existence as the gentle illumination of the emergency lighting found it. A long, tube, slowly tapering to a point. No, not one. Many. The presence became more pronounced in the room. I watched as the objects source grew more visible. Dense, matted hair. The tubes were sprouting from it. And then the eyes. Yellow - slitted - orbs. It sprang. The last thing I perceived in those final moments, as my body was wrapped handily in a clawed grip, was a pronounced and deliberate, \" Meow. \"",
        "The United States Federal Reserve System is the Central Bank of the United States . As such , they are in control of the quantity of government - created money . They have the unique power to create new money and they use this power to conduct what is called monetary policy . Monetary policy is the manipulation of the money supply and interest rates ( the price of borrowing ) . The Fed manipulates the money supply either by - creating new money and using it to purchase assets held by banks increasing the cash banks hold and the amount of loans they can make or - by selling assets it presently holds to reduce the amount of cash banks hold and the amount of loans they can make . By changing the amount of loans banks can make they also change the interest rate on those loans . More cash means more loans and a lower interest rate . Less cash means fewer loans and a higher interest rate . It has been observed that economic downturns can be made less severe by a cut in interest rates . If people are n't spending enough to keep unemployment low , a decrease in the interest rates will entice people to borrow and spend more . However , it has also been observed that cutting interest rates and increasing the supply of money can cause inflation ( which is when the price of everything goes up ) , especially when unemployment is n't very high . So the fed has what 's called a dual mandate : to keep unemployment low and prices stable . They 're controversial for a few reasons . The first is that they are very important . Monetary policy affects everyone . A poor choice of policy can leave millions unemployed or make everyone unnecessarily poorer . The second is that economics is complicated and often quite contentious . There are a few different ideas about the best way to conduct monetary policy . Most economists agree on the basics , but there are a not insignificant portion of economists who disagree wildly ( a portion popular with political libertarians , for example , say that the fed should n't control the money supply at all ) . The third is that current monetary policy is quite unusual . The United States has been in a slump for 6 years now . And for much of that time interest rates have been very close to zero . The Fed has been creating lots and lots of new money and buying bank assets with it to try to keep interest rates as low as possible and to convince people to spend more money . At other times in history , the rapid creation of new money has sometimes led to disaster ( Germany between WW1 and WW2 and Zimbabwe until quite recently are good examples ) by creating crazy levels of inflation . Some people fear the United States will suffer a similar fate ( although many argue that this is impossible while the US remains in a slump ) . And I guess the final reason is that the people in charge of the Fed are unelected experts rather than politicians .

For example, in [a local case in Minneapolis] , he was found guilty of \"second degree unintentional murder.\" Minnesota law defines second-degree unintentional murder as an act causing the death of \"a human being, without intent to effect the death of any person, while committing or attempting to commit a felony offense other than criminal sexual conduct in the first or second degree with force or violence or a drive-by shooting ...\" I think this is rediculous. If someone kills someone by beating them to death \"without meaning to,\" what difference does it make? They killed someone, and I don't think that there should be a difference whether it was premeditated to kill a specific person, if you plan to kill someone but not a specific person (gang violence), or you kill someone on a spur of the moment. Barring extenuating circumstances like self defense, I believe that if you murder someone, motives shouldn't be taken into account even if you \"accidentally\" beat someone to death. CMV. Edit: I apologize for this but I had a bunch of stuff come up an hour after I posted this so I couldn't continue arguments. However, I've been checking in over the last day, and there have been some fantastic arguments on here, and while I still think that in many cases like I gave of \"second degree unintentional homicide\" are pretty ridiculous, there has to be a line drawn somewhere in which (as was pointed out to me by uuniptf where motive is pretty irrelevant in a trial, but intent is what is taken into consideration) intent is taken into consideration. Intent should be taken into account to a point. I still have a lot of thinking to do before I finally decide on where that line is drawn. I have to also have to say that while I may think that self-defense isn't murder, if you completely disregard intent, then it is a flawed argument on my part. As many of you have pointed out, the different degrees of the crime are ways of making sure that those who murdered someone get at least some sort of justice. I also have to thank ulearhpa for pointing out that in order for something to be considered a crime, you have to have a \"criminal intent\" towards this. I'm going to go through everyone's arguments and respondaward deltas for those who gave me a different perspective and at least changed part of my viewpoint on this. Last of all, I just have to say I really enjoy this sub. It's one of the few places on reddit where there are actual civil discussions on things, and I really appreciate those who took the time to respond.",
        "In logic, a quantifier is an operator that specifies how many individuals in the domain of discourse satisfy an open formula. For instance, the universal quantifier \n\n\n\n∀\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\forall }\n\n in the first order formula \n\n\n\n∀\nx\nP\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\forall xP(x)}\n\n expresses that everything in the domain satisfies the property denoted by \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n. On the other hand, the existential quantifier \n\n\n\n∃\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\exists }\n\n in the formula \n\n\n\n∃\nx\nP\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\exists xP(x)}\n\n expresses that there exists something in the domain which satisfies that property. A formula where a quantifier takes widest scope is called a quantified formula. A quantified formula must contain a bound variable and a subformula specifying a property of the referent of that variable.\nThe mostly commonly used quantifiers are \n\n\n\n∀\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\forall }\n\n and \n\n\n\n∃\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\exists }\n\n. These quantifiers are standardly defined as duals; in classical logic, they are interdefinable using negation. They can also be used to define more complex quantifiers, as in the formula \n\n\n\n¬\n∃\nx\nP\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\neg \\exists xP(x)}\n\n which expresses that nothing has the property \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n. Other quantifiers are only definable within second order logic or higher order logics. Quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of Mostowski and Lindström.\nIn a first-order logic statement, quantifications in the same type (either universal quantifications or existential quantifications) can be exchanged without changing the meaning of the statement, while the exchange of quantifications in different types changes the meaning. As an example, the only difference in the definition of uniform continuity and (ordinary) continuity is the order of quantifications.\nFirst order quantifiers approximate the meanings of some natural language quantifiers such as \"some\" and \"all\". However, many natural language quantifiers can only be analyzed in terms of generalized quantifiers.",
        "Zohore's double helped Cardiff to a 3-1 win over Ipswich Town as the Denmark U21 striker took his tally to nine goals in his last 10 league games. \"I wouldn't swap him for many in the Championship,\" said Warnock. \"He's got every attribute and you can't coach what he has got.\" Warnock believes his management has been key in getting the best out of Zohore. \"There was not a player here like that when I came here,\" Warnock told BBC Wales Sport. \"He was not a waste of time, but he wasn't far away from being a waste of time. \"He walked about, wouldn't tackle, wouldn't chase back and he wore gloves everywhere. \"You name it really. \"But he's a good lad and the chat I had with him against Wolves at half-time (in December) was obviously vital, because he's been a revelation since then.\" Warnock says the transformation in Zohore's game is comparable to that of some Premier League and international players he has worked with in his lengthy managerial career. \"Oh yeah, Victor Moses (now at Chelsea) was one, there have been a few players who surprised me,\" Warnock said. \"A few that didn't realise (how good they could be). Phil Jagielka (Everton and England) is another, when I first got hold of him. \"Some lads don't believe in themselves and need convincing. \"The minimum you should get out of a player is 100. Then the ability goes on top. \"You need that work ethic at any level of the game. \"When you do that, you make your own luck, as Gary Player used to say.\" However, Warnock is unconcerned that rival clubs might be looking at Zohore, who he has previously stated was not for sale, even at PS20 million. \"He will not be going anywhere,\" added Warnock. \"I am happy with that. They won't sell him behind my back, I will tell you that. \"I think Vincent (Tan) is enjoying it as much as me.\" Warnock also feels he has improved winger Kadeem Harris, whose direct running led to Cardiff's third goal. \"He's another one like Ken, I think he needs me more than I need him,\" he said. \"I thought he'd been here six months, but he's been here three or four years,\" \"So he's been a waste of time, hasn't he? So hopefully the penny drops and he stays with us. \"I have talked to his dad a couple of times. Sometimes the grass looks greener on the other side, but if I was Kadeem, I would be looking to stay here. \"He has someone who believes in him and gives him a chance.\"",
        "Zatoichi The Outlaw was the first film made by its hero's (Shintaro Katsu) own production company, this is perhaps why this is a slightly lesser entry in the series, though it is by no means weak overall. It tells of our hero coming across two towns, rival bosses and a mysterious ronin helping the poor and from this set up spins a tale encompassing tragedy, violence and no little interest, all served up with lashings of the unshowy but inspired swordplay that is one of the series trademarks. It is a fairly predictable plot and it mounts in unsurprising fashion, but it zips along with style and is interesting stuff. The helpful ronin for example is a nobly inscrutable revolutionary character, upsetting the established order without being painted as a truly likable or heroic figure, Zatoichi himself makes one or two mistakes and causes harm by his actions, whilst the ruling system fuels the exploitation of the poor. Its a harsh world, with one or two more visceral than expected moments in the fighting, though things aren't as rousing as they could be. Shintaro Katsu turns in a typical bravura performance as Zatoichi, mixing wisdom, deadly skill and worldliness with a subtly sad sense of vulnerability, while solid work comes also from Rentarô Mikuni and an effectively baleful Kô Nishimura (later to appear as Katsu's superior \"Snake\" Magobei in the Hanzo trilogy) as the two main bosses in the film. There is also a good emotional turn from Yuko Hamada as a wronged woman. The film loses out through shaky pacing and a not so well constructed sequence of events, there is at least one slightly jarring time jump and the power of the plot becomes a little lost, meaning that when things heat up towards the end the film isn't as exciting as it could be, emotional impact is lost also. The action or scenes of Zatoichi using his ingenious skills are well handled by director Satsuo Yamamoto, though some of the gambling is less interesting and the film builds up in a workmanlike rather than really inspired way, without the lively characters or strong verve of some other installments. Still, I enjoyed this one, it has its flaws and isn't one of the best of the series but it still packs a sweetly satisfying dose of entertainment, a good story and decent doses of Zatoichi's trademark ingenious and quirky cool. Recommended for fans of the series, and a reasonable entry point, classy stuff though not a true great.",
        "Federations must rule on whether Russians can compete in Rio following the country's doping scandal. The Union Cycliste Internationale said three cyclists were withdrawn due to previous drugs cases, with another three implicated in the doping scandal. Wrestler Viktor Lebedev, who returned a positive doping test at the 2006 Junior World Championships, was also banned. Following a report conducted by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren, which said Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015, the International Olympic Committee ruled any Russian athlete who has served a doping ban will not be eligible for Rio 2016. So far, more than 110 of the 387-strong Russian team have been banned from the Games, which get under way on 5 August. The final line-up will be announced on 30-31 July, according to the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC). Eleven of Russia's 17-strong cycling squad have been cleared to ride in Brazil. United World Wrestling cleared 16 Russian wrestlers, while all four Russian badminton players have been told by the sport's governing body they can compete. Badminton World Federation's Thomas Lund said the governing body was satisfied the athletes had been tested in and out of competition. \"We have had a rigid drug-testing programme, especially leading up to Rio 2016,\" he added. \"Their samples have been analysed outside of Russia.\" Boxing, golf, gymnastics, handball, taekwondo and weightlifting are still to confirm their eligibility decisions. \"We will tell how many people will go in the next few days,\" said Alexander Zhukov, the head of the ROC. About 70 Russian athletes left Moscow for Brazil on Thursday, following a farewell ceremony hosted by Russian president Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. \"They have got us fired up but in a good way,\" said handball player Polina Kuznetsova of the cheering crowd at Moscow's Sheremetevo airport. \"We are going to fight more to prove that it is difficult to break Russia. We will fight for those who were not able to go.\" Olympic champion pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva and world champion hurdler Sergey Shubenkov are among 67 of the 68-strong athletics team to have been banned by the International Athletics Federation. Isinbayeva corrected reports on Thursday suggesting she might be the Russian team's flag bearer in Rio, despite not being able to compete. \"We should clarify one very important thing!\" she said via Instagram. \"Flag bearer at the Olympics in Rio have already been defined, it is a great athlete, Olympic champion Sergey Tetyukhin (volleyball).\"",
        "In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.\nSince an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input.: 226  Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases—that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n)}\n\n, \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\nlog\n⁡\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n\\log n)}\n\n, \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nn\n\nα\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n^{\\alpha })}\n\n, \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\n2\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(2^{n})}\n\n, etc., where n is the size in units of bits needed to represent the input.\nAlgorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation. For example, an algorithm with time complexity \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n)}\n\n is a linear time algorithm and an algorithm with time complexity \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nn\n\nα\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n^{\\alpha })}\n\n for some constant \n\n\n\nα\n>\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha >1}\n\n is a polynomial time algorithm.",
        "Many people have provided very good answers to this question and all the answers provide sound advice and justification. Below are some of my thoughts on the questions that you have put forward. 1) The investment manager question: The returns on your capital for a half year has been quite low; having said that, some investments do take more than half year to show some growth. You could try talking to your investment manager and ask where your money has been deployed and why the returns are low. If there are no real explanation given forth (which would be more likely as you have mentioned your investment manager does not like to discuss your money with you) you should conside Xolorus & Pete's advice and forthwith take all your money from investment manager and park it in the bank till you figure out what to do next with it. 2) Finances are not my forte: At 22 finance is nobodies forte, it takes longer than that; however having said that, how do you know finance is actually not your forte? Being a computer science graduate you would be more than comfortable with the mathematics required for finance. You may not have looked seriously at finance till now (I assume by your statement). Once way to be certain about this would be self learning, some good books have been refered above and there are online information, courses and articles on the Internet, for example here. You could give some spare time and explore if finance interests you or not. 3) If finance interests you: Then consider the 30K as your seed fund and take a small portion of it say 2K and try out your hand at investing on your own in the instruments that you feel most comfortable and see how you fare, you are young enough to take the risk. Rest of the money you could put in other low risk instruments (that you have identified through self study) 4) If finance does not interest you: The probably you are better off with an investment manager, as observed above, it will take some time for you to identify him/her 5) On returns: As mentioned above different instruments produce returns differently, however, one question that is universally asked is how much return on an invetment shoule one expect (you were expecting more than $12 on your investment). It is a difficult question to answer as invetment returns and investment needs depend on a persons financial goals and risk taking profile. One way to have some measure is to take 15-20 years CAGR of the stock index return and reduce it by 2-3%, that is (in many cases, not all) a reasonable return expectation in medium-long term.",
        "It was my 4th visit. My friend Dan had been living here for over a year now and kept bragging how mankind had finally created a true democratic society. He wanted me to move in but I remained skeptical. These new Web-Towns we're emerging all over the world but I still had a bitter taste in my mouth from that three months experience in Los Google. Having to share all my private life with city officials every time I needed to take a piss wasn't my definition of \"enhanced services.\" \"Stop looking so grim, New Reddit is nothing like that shit hole you tried last year.\" Dan said as we reached our destination. I looked at the large marble arch in front of us, rAskReddit was carved in it. \"What's so special about this place?\" I replied. \"I'm telling you man, this neighborhood will blow your mind. Anything you could possibly wonder, someone here will be able to answer it.\" He said with such enthusiasm that I finally smiled. We started walking around but I felt like such a tourist. The place looked like a giant fair. Everywhere we went, someone was standing on a little stage with a sign in his hands. What movie has the worst ending? What is career suicide in your industry? What sentence do you know that can start an internet war? I couldn't understand why these questions mattered to anyone but the crowd seemed to love it. Hundreds of them gathered around each stage, shouting their answers. \"Chewing gum!\" \"Oranges!\" \"Pancakes!\" I must have been pretty hungry. Out of everything being yelled around us, food caught my attention. This Asian kid was sitting at a table, in the center of a stage. To his left, the biggest pot of rice I'd seen in my life. To his right, a bunch of random food people gave him. Was this some sort of social experiment? This kid was asking his fellow citizen for disgusting food ideas to eat over rice and rating it on a scale of 1 to 10. It was so silly but oddly entertaining. I found myself watching him for over thirty minutes while he tested Nutella, Jelly beans and Spaghetti on top of rice. \"C'mon buddy, there's plenty more stuff I want to show you today\" Dan said while dragging me away from this hypnotizing spectacle. We resumed our walk, while he continued to sing the praise of New Reddit. It was just a few blocks later that we both stopped again but... not because of a stage act this time. A gorgeous blond girl in high heels, wearing the shortest of skirts and a slim white shirt was coming our way. ' I love New Reddit'the shirt said. How clever. \"Damn man look at her, she's a 9!\" he said in awe. I couldn't help it. \"1010 with rice\"",
        "No, I've never seen any of the \"Santa Slasher\" series, i.e. 'Silent Night, Deadly Night,' the original 'Black Christmas' or this one, 'Christmas Evil.' I've heard all about their reputation, or, MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas.) I thought I would rent this one as I've heard it pop up as a reference on a 'Fat Guys At the Movies' segment.<br /><br />Mothers should be against this, but not for the ooooohhhh \"killer\" Santa, but for the fact this movie was just plain crap. Boring, long  even at only 92 minutes, crap.<br /><br />Little boy sees Santa arrive down a chimney in 1947, deliver presents, eat some goodies and miraculously, float up the chimney. Boy goes to bed, but returns to living room to witness Mommy and Santa (sort of) getting it on. Apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life, though the scene was about as steamy as when Ralphie's dad got the \"Leg Lamp\" in 'A Christmas Story.' He was sooo disturbed, he went to the attic and, well cut his own hand.<br /><br />Fast forward to the future! Now, it's 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory. We get a whiff of him being a little off-kilter, and he stalks both kids and parents alike. Who's naughty, who's nice, blah blah. It takes a good two-thirds of the film to get him to finally snap  as if that's not foreshadowed from frame one. NO MOVIE should take that long.<br /><br />I will admit, this movie had its tension building, but only because I kept expecting him to do something, anything to anyone. When he finally does, well, punish \"who's naughty,\" it's as graphic as a \"Garbage Pail Kid\" card. And I haven't mentioned the WTF ending. I'm thinking it was a metaphor, but in reality, it's just as weird as the rest of the movie. (Take the brother who's upset his sibling is killing, and his solution isuh, killing.) Don't open this mess, even on Christmas Eve, or Evil. Again, I didn't watch the other \"Santa-Slashers\" but this one sucked bad. It built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present.",
        "The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had \"ironclad information\" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and \"pushed hard\" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was \"just not true,\" but he hoped the resolution would \"serve as a wake-up call\" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.\" Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. \"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said. \"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families.... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution \"paves the way\" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January. \"We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,\" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.",
        "About 14m birds are bred for the table a year. Processing companies are big employers and the industry sustains thousands of jobs on farms and in factories. But poultry has a problem - how to deal with the waste it generates. At the moment, the millions of birds reared in Northern Ireland create 260,000 tonnes of poultry litter a year. The litter is a mix of bedding and droppings and if the industry expands, it could generate 400,000 tonnes of waste annually. For the moment, much of the waste is spread as fertiliser on fields. But it is rich in nitrogen and phosphorous which can run off into rivers and lakes and damage them - a process known as eutrophication. European Union regulations are in place to stop that. To show it is making progress, Northern Ireland needs a long term solution to deal with its poultry waste. The Northern Ireland Executive has set up a PS15-20m fund to try to find an answer and soon it will be spending some of that cash. It will be lent to companies who will use it to part fund at least two \"demonstrator\" plants to test new technology. They would be expected to deal with at least 20,000 tonnes of waste a year. Six applications have been assessed by the business development agency, Invest NI. Stormont's Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill said at Christmas that schemes based on anaerobic digestion (AD) were furthest advanced in the selection process. Anaerobic digestion uses micro-organisms to break down organic matter inside a sealed and heated system. That gives off a biogas which can be burned to produce heat and power, but there is a problem with using AD technology for this. Unless expensive stripping processes are included, the same amount of nitrogen and phosphorous going into the system in the poultry litter, will be present in the byproduct, or digestate, when it comes out. If you want to spread the digestate on land, you will face the same potential problems with eutrophication. That is why, in 2014, a report commissioned by the agriculture minister said anaerobic digestion was not the answer to the poultry litter problem. However, it seems officials are determined to overcome this issue with the AD projects being assessed for funding. The Department of Agriculture has said that, in those projects, the digestate would either be exported for field spreading or further refined to separate out the nutrients in pellet form. The first loan agreement with Invest NI was expected to be signed by the end of last year. The minister said that once the finance was in place, she expected the first plants could be operational by late 2016 or early 2017.",

        "There are only two powerful parties in the US , for two related reasons . First , in national elections , the states in the US are \" winner take all \" . If you win a state 's election and you get 55 % of the votes , you get all of that state 's votes , and not just 55 % of them . This makes it very easy to have one or two strong parties , but makes it very difficult to have three strong parties . A strong third party would not be able to become important just by winning a lot of votes in a lot of states . Winning 30 % of the vote in every state but coming in second or third would be less effective than winning 51 % of the vote in the smallest state . The other reason is that both of these parties agree on a lot of things and are able to argue against anyone who does n't believe in what the Democratic and Republican parties agree on . The reason they are treated as if they are very different on TV and in the newspapers is because of \" partisan politics \" . \" Partisan \" means \" supporter \" . In partisan politics , \" winning \" is often the most important thing . It 's often more important than an agenda , or whatever reason you wanted to \" win \" for in the first place . Partisan Democrats and partisan Republicans talk about one another as if they were almost always wrong , and sometimes as if they were downright evil . Partisan politics is like turning politics into sports . One team will win , either \" your team \" or \" the other team \" . In American football , it does n't matter if you agree that the opponent 's quarterback is a very good person who plays the game well , you still want your team to win . One result of this is that in the news , politics is usually covered by telling you who 's \" winning \" opinion polls , or who 's probably going to win the election , rather than letting you know what each person stands for and letting you decide between them . This is often called \" horse race politics \" , because it covers who 's coming out ahead rather than what anyone actually wants to accomplish once they win an election . As far as what the Democrats and Republicans agree on , quite honestly , it 's most things ! Most Republicans and Democrats believe that capitalism is very important , that \" real \" campaign finance reform is bad ( campaign finance reform would mean that businesses would be able to give less money to politicians to run for office ) , that whatever the government does about the economy should result in less unemployment and less inflation ( the problem is that sometimes what you do to \" fix \" one hurts the other ) , that we should lower crime , and in basic freedom . How they differ is often not what they believe in but what they believe is the best way to make it happen .",
        "Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou will fight the provisional two-year bans imposed on them by the IAAF at an independent tribunal this weekend.Athletics' ruling body took action against the pair for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. An independent tribunal of the Greek Track and Field Federation will meet to decide whether to ratify the sanction. The sprint duo face charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to a drugs test. Kenteris' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport: \"We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical. \"There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client's rights. \"There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.\" Ioannidis, who is a law lecturer at the University of Buckingham, added: \"One of the important rights and foundations of law and justice - that the accused should be presumed innocent unless proved otherwise - has been tarnished.\" The panel will also decide on the two-year ban imposed on the athletes' controversial coach Christos Tzekos by the IAAF. Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women's 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, quit the Olympics on 18 August after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony.Testers could not find them at the Olympic village and the duo were later admitted to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. They also missed tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens before the Games. In imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 December, the IAAF described their explanations for missing the tests as \"unacceptable\". Whatever the findings of the independent tribunal, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The tribunal hearing will take place at the Hellenic Olympic Committee building. It will start at 1200 GMT on Saturday and is expected to finish early next week. The tribunal panel will consist of five members - president Konstantinos Panagopoulos and Panagiotis Dimakos, Haralabos Hrisanthakis, Stilianos Perakis and Ioannis Karmis. Kenteris and Thanou also face criminal charges in Greece for allegedly faking the motorcycle accident. Eight criminal charges have been laid against the sprinters as well as Tzekos, an eyewitness to the accident and hospital officials. But there has been speculation that the charges could be dropped.",
        "The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has had to halt deliveries to the Red Sea port of Hudaydah. It said this was partly because it had not received security guarantees. The port has also been targeted by warplanes from a Saudi-led coalition which is backing Yemen's government in its war with the rebel Houthi movement. UN attempts to bring in five cranes to replace those damaged in the attacks have not been successful. The ICRC's Middle East regional director Robert Mardini warned that Yemen, which depends on imports for 90 of its food supplies, was now living on its \"reserves\" and that the \"day will come very soon\" when they run out. He said that despite the focus on the damage and casualties caused by the fighting, thousands of people were dying \"silently\" of complications due to malnutrition, or of minor illnesses or injuries which were not being treated at the 45 of health facilities that are still functioning. The conflict, which escalated in March 2015, has left at least 7,500 people dead and 40,000 injured, according to the United Nations. But almost 19 million people are in need of some form of humanitarian assistance. Seven million people do not know where their next meal is coming from and more than three million, including 2.1 million children, are suffering from acute malnutrition. The UN's emergency relief co-ordinator, Stephen O'Brien, called on the warring parties to guarantee more access to ports to let in food, fuel and medicine imports on Monday. He told the BBC the situation was \"very desperate,\" and that he had seen children so \"severely malnourished\" that he feared they would not survive another day. Earlier this month, the UN appealed for 2.1bn (PS1.7bn) to provide life-saving assistance to 12 million people in Yemen over the next year. But it has so far received only 43m. On Tuesday, Mr O'Brien was forced to cancel a visit to the city of Taiz, which is besieged by rebel fighters, reportedly after his convoy came under fire. In a separate development on Tuesday, UN human rights officials said they had evidence of the recruitment of child soldiers in Yemen, mostly by groups affiliated with the Houthis. In all, the UN managed to verify the recruitment of 1,476 children, all boys, between March 2015 and the end of January 2017. However, it said the numbers were likely to be much higher.",
        "So I'm a person who believes that human life is sacred and that life begins at conception. I also believe that it the best policy with respect to abortion rights is to first recognize that abortion being legal prevents even worse outcomes, and second, to fund the hell out of programs that provide contraception, pre-natal screenings, and adoption programs so that women who get pregnant when they don't want to have the economic freedom to choose for the life of their child. So while I am pro-life in terms of my beliefs, I am pro-choice in terms of my policy support. Lately the GOP (and to be clear, I'm largely a liberal democrat but with respect to this one issue) has taken to passing laws that require physicians to lie to patients about medical and scientific facts in order to coerce them into keeping their children. For example, they're seeking to pass legislation in a number of states that require physicians to tell patients that a fetus can feel pain at [22 weeks gestational age] even though there [is little evidence to support that claim.] I am of the opinion that his is a horrible policy move. Government sanctioned lying can never result in a positive outcome. Edit: The reason I say that is because this will inevitably lead the voting public to be distrustful of any government claims as people learn that the government is actually required by law to deceive the public over issues that are simple factual questions. It is in the government's greater interest to be a trustworthy source of information except possibly in cases of national security interests. I also don't believe that this strategy will actually do much to help in preventing abortions. Abortions happened when they were fully illegal before, and they will continue to happen if we make them illegal again: either through illicit surgical procedures of questionable safety, or through intentional drug overdoses and other acts that are dangerous for the mother. The only way to legitimately limit abortion rates is to provide adequate access to contraception, along with the economic and social support necessary to choose to carry a child to term (and ensure the potential for that child to have a healthy, successful life) as a real option.

        "In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.\nSince an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input.: 226  Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases—that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n)}\n\n, \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\nlog\n⁡\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n\\log n)}\n\n, \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nn\n\nα\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n^{\\alpha })}\n\n, \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\n2\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(2^{n})}\n\n, etc., where n is the size in units of bits needed to represent the input.\nAlgorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation. For example, an algorithm with time complexity \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n)}\n\n is a linear time algorithm and an algorithm with time complexity \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nn\n\nα\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n^{\\alpha })}\n\n for some constant \n\n\n\nα\n>\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha >1}\n\n is a polynomial time algorithm.",
        "I'm a bit conflicted over this. The show is on one hand awful, the acting is terrible (even when we get actual name actors like Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley in one episode), the dialogue is moronic and the premise/moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short. There's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes, and Robert Englund's cameos are short, pointless and corny in a sort of a Bob Saget on America's Funniest Home Videos kind of way.<br /><br />On the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television. The 80s fashions, the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of The View at all times, the premises lend the material more to self-parody than scares, so we're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his SAT's his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him, another is afraid she'll be locked up in prison because she's a substandard mom (her husband is played by Brad Pit), another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home, another is afraid she'll be confused with her socially-retarded twin, another is afraid if he doesn't break up his mom and step-dad he'll get killed for having a party at his house. The list goes on and on.<br /><br />Being that these are dreams I suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices, but they're so out of left field that there's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience. You have characters dressed like something out of a 80s-themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point (typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about it).<br /><br />If you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away. If you're looking, on the other hand, for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever. Watch it.<br /><br />Its been showing on Chiller TV lately (pretty much every day) and I've been watching, earlier out of morbid curiosity, and now just so I can get a good laugh in each day.

        "When we use acids in water , we like to compare the concentration of protons [ H+ ] . A really important concept when thinking about aqueous acids and bases is a physical constant called Kw , it 's 1x10 ^ -14 , and it is defined as [ H+][OH- ] , i.e the concentration of protons multiplied by the concentration of hydroxyl ( OH- ) ions . This allows us to easily convert between [ OH- ] and [ H+ ] , as their product is constant . If we have a 1.0 M of HCl , then we might anticipate that that will fully break up into H+ and Cl- , giving us [ H+]=1.0M. If we have 1.0 M of NaOH , then we might expect that to fully break up into Na+ and OH- . We want to be able to compare the acidity of the solutions though , so we can convert [ OH-]=1.0 into a value of [ H+ ] using Kw . [ H+ ] = Kw/[OH- ] Giving us , for 1.0 M NaOH , [ H+ ] = 1x10 ^ -14 . Now , 1 and 1x10 ^ -14 are very different numbers , and we 're humans - we like numbers that we can think about , like 6 or 12 or 241 . So we can squeeze this entire range into a much ' nicer ' range of numbers ( 0 to 14 - but I 'll explain that ) . In order to compress this range of orders of magnitude we must use a logarithmic scale . All this means is that when go from pH 1 to ph 2 , we are changing an order of magnitude , not a single digit . The process of taking the logarithm of a number means that you are asking the question ' What power do I have to raise 10 to in order to get this number ' i.e log(10 ^ 6 ) = 6 . pH is defined as -log[H+ ] . There are non - trivial things going on here - the negative sign . This means that the range goes from 0 to 14 , rather than from -14 to 0 . Like so many things in science , we have to define a direction , even though it does n't really matter : we often pick the one that is warmest and fuzziest ( 0 to 14 seems really nice , right ? ) and as long as you can learn and know that a low pH indicates more [ H+ ] than [ OH- ] , i.e. indicates acidic behaviour , then you can use and apply the pH scale as you wish .

        "Michael Schumacher (91) and Alain Prost (51) are the two other men to rack up a half-century of victories. Germany's Schumacher and Frenchman Prost won 11 world titles between them, putting three-time champion Hamilton in rarefied company. BBC Sport takes a look at the key stats behind Hamilton's race wins, and picks out five of his best victories. Lewis Hamilton's Formula 1 career is one of many illustrations of the problems with using statistics alone to define a driver's \"greatness.\" In the first seven years of Hamilton's career, he amassed 22 wins; three years on and he has just taken his 50th. The exponential increase in ratio owing to nothing other than being comfortably the faster driver in the only car capable of winning. Is Hamilton three times better as a driver now than he was in 2013? Of course not, any more than Michael Schumacher (91 wins) was more than twice as good as Ayrton Senna (41). This, though, is not to say that Hamilton is not an all-time great driver - that, he undoubtedly is. His biggest strength is his blistering speed, founded on an incredible feel for a car on the limits of adhesion during the braking phase for a corner. Jenson Button had it right when he said Hamilton is \"one of the fastest drivers there has ever been.\" His raw pace is right up there with the very best. Senna, Jim Clark, Juan Manuel Fangio - he's that good. All drivers have their flaws and Hamilton is no exception - he has bizarrely off-form days; he is not as rounded a talent as some, or as complete. But is there a faster driver with more natural talent in F1 today? Almost certainly not. Andrew Benson, chief F1 writer Good though win number 50 was, numbers alone don't accurately reflect the career of Lewis Hamilton. When the Englishman is on form, as he was in Austin on Sunday, he's sublime and his wins take on greater significance than a mere pot in his trophy cabinet. He told us on Radio 5 live that F1 is a perennial search for perfection, and just occasionally he achieves it. Think Silverstone 2008, Monaco'08, Turkey'10; all of them awe-inspiring performances. Peaks such as these are so high that he's unable to repeat them at every race, but he should remembered as much for them as for mere statistics.

        "I'm not saying that if you smoke a bunch of pot or mix all these drugs together, it will necessarily make you smarter. If you do this habitually, it's more probable that you will end up dumber... But if used infrequently and with moderation, these drugs can treat (and sometimes cure) a variety of mental and emotional disorders that 90 of us suffer from, such as depression, anger, anxiety, and lack of motivation... All of which reduce andor hinder the development of intelligence. This is possible because the chemicals in these drugs, like so many others we consume (e.g. caffeine, sugar), have the ability to alter the way your brain creates neural pathways. This forces a different perspective into your conscious mind, essentially making you a different person. The effects are temporary, but the neural pathways you created under the influence of the drugs will be retained after regaining sobriety. This allows one to change their own view without using reddit! For example, chronically depressed people physically have (or are using) a smaller proportion of neural connections in the brain associated with happiness. One or two relatively small doses of MDMA coupled with therapeutic treatment can create a chain reaction that results in a monumental shift in consciousness, behavior, and emotional inclination and capacity. Who we are, how we think, and how we perceive the world around us is essentially determined by a series of little electric wires. Everything you will ever know or feel will be stored in this network, and it grows new pathways all the time. Where depends on what you're learning. If you were learning German, you would be growing new connections between the Broca's and Wernicke's areas of your brain... And I just made a few connections in my arcuate fasciculus by looking that up. If you smoke some pot, and it enhances the flavor of your least favorite health food, or it increases your appreciation for music, or inspires creativity... That rubs off. Because of that experience, you will like that food a little more, you'll feel the music a little more, you'll get a little more inspired to create in the future.

        "The Perth club has suspended the team-mates pending a club investigation. Wright told BBC Scotland that \"if what's alleged\" to have occurred did in fact happen \"we'll come down severely hard on both.\" Referee Don Robertson sent off both players during the break. Wright, whose side confirmed their top six place due to results elsewhere, says he did not see the incident as he had already started walking up the tunnel following the half time whistle. BBC Scotland reporter Jonathan Sutherland saw Foster throw a punch at Swanson, who retaliated by aiming a kick at the defender after he had slipped. \"I haven't seen it with my own eyes but obviously something happened,\" said Wright. \"I'm going to wait and see for myself. The players have been told they let themselves down, and let the team down. We should be celebrating confirming our top six place tonight. \"Under no circumstance will they get off lightly if what is alleged to have happened has happened. The hardest punishment I can do legally with them, I'll do it.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Wright was angry that the incident left his side up against it in the second half, and that the shine was taken off the Saints confirming a top six berth. \"It's another great achievement getting the top six,\" he added. \"We showed a lot of character and should have had a penalty.

        "The authorities say they want to check whether the organisations are operating legally - particularly whether they comply with a controversial law requiring all NGOs receiving overseas funding to register as \"foreign agents.\" But human rights watchdog Agora says at least 90 NGOs have used its hotline since last week to complain about visits by officials from the prosecutor-general's office, the justice ministry and the tax authorities. Foreign NGOs - such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Transparency International - have been among those targeted. Marina Gridneva, from the prosecutor-general's office, said the checks were being conducted \"in strict compliance with the current legislation.\" Russian officials typically arrive unannounced, or at short notice, and request groups to hand over legal and financial documents, eyewitnesses say. Yelena Panfilova, who heads Transparency International's office in Moscow, said she was surprised that it was being checked again - just a month after a similar inspection. Law enforcement agents visited her office on Wednesday and gave her 24 hours to hand over paperwork. Ms Panfilova's links the checks with the new NGO legislation. \"We are on the list of NGOs that are visible and presumably receive foreign funding. As far as I understand, there is a big search for'foreign agents' among the NGOs,\" she told the BBC. When the controversial law on NGOs was approved in November, a number of prominent Russian groups said they would not comply - even if that risked closure. They regard the term \"foreign agents\" as insulting, saying it harks back to Stalin-era purges. Memorial, an NGO gathering information about victims of Communism, reiterated this position earlier this week when law enforcement agents turned up at its office. \"Memorial... has carried out a research of people who 70 years ago were called agents by the authorities and then shot. For us, taking on the label of a foreign agent is unacceptable,\" Memorial's Alexander Cherkasov told Reuters news agency. The \"foreign agent\" bill was one of several controversial laws adopted in the aftermath of last year's pro-democracy protests in Moscow. Other measures introduced tougher internet restrictions, outlawed \"gay propaganda\" and banned adoptions of Russian orphans by US parents. \"The scale of these inspections serves to reinforce the menacing atmosphere for civil society created by the adoption of last year's laws,\" Human Rights Watch's Rachel Denber told Reuters. The group's Moscow bureau was inspected last Thursday. Several NGOs, including Transparency International, reported that the visiting officials were also looking into the organisations' compliance with anti-extremist legislation. Russia's law gives an extremely vague definition of extremism, allowing officials much leeway in choosing their targets.",
        "I hope Writing Prompts allows true stories, because this actually happened to my father. I'll try and write it as best I can from his POV. It was the 60's, I never wanted to hurt anyone, so when I joined the US military stationed in London I became a combat medic. We were flying into our base when for some reason, the radio operator leaned over to me and said \"This plane is going to crash.\" At first I thought he must be joking, Confused, I looked around, and asked \"What are you talking about?\" The radio operator replied \"Our pilot has only landed planes where there were two landing gear wheels in back. He's never landed a taildragger before! \" , he then sat back in his seat and chuckled. Was he messing with me? Surely if we were likely to crash, someone would actually care? Right? Or is everyone just that crazy? They would never let him fly without training him for that type of landing, would they? I checked my seat belt, it was still tight. I tried to put it out of my mind. Should I say something? What could I say? As I thought about it, we were rapidly coming in for a landing. Everything felt normal. As we were about to touch down, I felt the plane lifting and dropping strangely, then a bump. Was that from the back or the front? Then I looked out the window next to me and saw the length of the runway stretching out in front of me as if I were the pilot. That's not good. As the cabin turned into a blur I caught sight of the radio operator flying past me. And then just sound of metal sliding. Then, with a sudden jerk, we were stopped. I undid my selt-belt and fell out of my seat. The radio operator was clutching his leg and lying against the cabin wall. Really? After warning us all we were going to crash he's the only one who doesn't put on his seat belt? I guess it's a good thing he's in a plane full of medics. Aside from one broken leg, we were all ok. In london, there's a practice where a new driver has a special \"Learner's plate\" attached to their car when they're learning to drive. It's a big yellow square with a black'L' on it. The next time that pilot went to fly a plane we made sure it was covered head to toe in hundreds of L plates.",
        "Investigations were suspended in 2011 after a critical report into the running of the office. The report found that the independence of the office had been compromised. Many of the cases involve allegations of security force collusion. At the time the ombudsman was Al Hutchinson. The critical report into his office was carried out by the then criminal justice inspector, Michael Maguire, who replaced Mr Hutchinson as police ombudsman in July 2012. The report said there had been a lowering of operational independence between the ombudsman and the police, and that investigations into historical events should be suspended. The criticism contributed to the early retirement of Mr Hutchinson. A follow-up inspection report published on Wednesday concluded that enough improvements have been made for historical investigations to resume. Dr Maguire said his previous role had given him an \"understanding of the issues that needed to be addressed.\" \"The office has worked very hard over the last year to put some of those issues in a way which repositions the office to be able to recommence these investigations again,\" he said. \"I welcome the CJI (Criminal Justice Inspection) report because I think it's the first stage in rebuilding confidence in the office and the work that it does.\" He said work had been done to make improvements across a range of areas. \"We've recruited a significant number of new staff who have direct experience in major investigations, changed the ways we prioritise cases, introduced thorough investigative process which are subject to ongoing and systemic review and we've developed a consistent approach to communication for the families,\" he said. The ombudsman's office has been given PS12m to complete more than 150 historical cases over the next six years. Dr Maguire admitted that the number of cases to examine was \"ambitious.\" \"At the beginning of exercise we will be doing a lot of review work which collects investigative material,\" he said. \"Many of those cases, in some cases 20 or 30 complaints, can be clustered around a particular core issue and be dealt with on an ongoing basis. \"I think given those two reasons we're in a much better place to be able to look at these cases in a shorter time frame than has been before.\" However, the DUP's Paul Givan raised concerns about the re-opening of historical investigations. He said it had \"the potential to once again damage confidence in the ombudsman's office.\" \"The DUP has consistently argued the police ombudsman should solely focus upon dealing with present day complaints into the PSNI and de-couple it from historical investigations which has marred this office in controversy from its inception,\" he said. \"As a result of this decision the ombudsman office will become the subject of intense political scrutiny and debate that will only serve to distract from the important oversight role it has for effectively dealing with modern day policing issues. \"",
        "\"Adam?\" He lowered his chin, his eyes settling on her red hair that fell over his chest. Her body was becoming heavier the longer she laid on him, but Adam couldn't push her off. He didn't want to. \"Yeah?\" he said, stroking a thumb across her freckled arm. \"Could you stop?\" \"Stop what?\" Adam's thumb halted. \"Stop listening to me.\" Adam's brow tightened, his head tilted to the side, trying to catch a look at her face. \"Sophie, what are you talking abo She moved her body on his chest, sitting up and flipping her torso, so to gaze into his eyes. She was opening them, bringing a fist to her socket, rubbing gently. \"Good morning,\" she voiced through a yawn. \"What were you saying?\" Adam's eyes widened. She was just talking to me, he thought. She was just..... \"No one,\" he said, feigning a smile. \"Hungry?\" \"I'll make us some toast.\" Sophie brought herself to her knees and climbed off the bed, exiting the room with a flirty twirl. Adam rubbed his eyes, shaking his head, as if he had just woken himself. Scraping could be heard from the door, a knife to crusted bread, along with the clinks of mugs being drawn from the cabinet. Adam sat up and walked to the kitchen, wobbling as he stood. \"Sophie, don't butter it too much.\" Adam was nearing the kitchen, when the sounds dissipated, leaving nothing but silence throughout the house. He stepped through the living room. \"Sophie? Did you hear me?\" Adam put a hand to the corner of kitchen, peeking in. There was no one. No bread was out or toasted. No mugs were sitting on the counter. Not even coffee being brewed. \"Sophie, where'd you go?\" He called out, stepping fully into the empty kitchen. \"Adam?\" Her faint voice echoed down the hall. \"Where are you?\" \"Bedroom, babe.\" The bedroom? Adam thought. He strode through the hallway, past the bare walls and single bathroom. As he neared the room, he called out again. \"Sophie, I thought you were He stood silent as he scanned the bedroom. The sheets were just as he had left them. Furled and twisted, the comforter on the floor, the pillows strewn about the mattress. Sophie wasn't there. Just an empty bed. An empty room. And just as he were to speak, he heard a voice bounce against the naked hallway. It was quiet, but clear. \"Adam?\"",
        "Users who have rated this movie so highly simply can't have seen enough good films to compare it with. Have they all been brainwashed?? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie.<br /><br />From the first, BU is just a chase film. We pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another. And another. And another. And another. Do you see a pattern emerging? There is virtually no time 'wasted' on plot, character development, or boring old reality.<br /><br />If you haven't see the other two Bourne films, you're pretty lost. If you have - you only WISH you were lost - somewhere a long way from a cinema.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass's dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on United 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen, but on Bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character. He runs. He jumps. He punches. He gets blown up. He clears tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all - he SURVIVES. He survives like a plastic Action Man survives, which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension. So he drives off a building? So what? He'll survive. Yawn.<br /><br />There's a girl thrown into the mix because Bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she's just decor. I've seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of Captain Scarlet.<br /><br />Bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn't know from the first movie. He was turned into a killing machine. Big deal. He finds out his true identity. So what? It doesn't have any emotional resonance when it comes.<br /><br />The 'twist' ending is telegraphed and weak. Oh, dear, the more I think about this film the more I hate it! I've already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment! I'd better end now before the slide continues.<br /><br />I love a good action flick and I love a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is neither. It's a loud, tedious series of flashy edits, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /><br />The idea that it 'shows the way' to the Bond franchise is utter crap. Casino Royale blows it out of the water.",
        "At the end of the day, money can only influence elections in one way; advertising. All that money can do is buy more posters and commercials. If you are a moderate voter, maybe that could sway you. Maybe. More likely, you will, as everyone else does, be skeptical of campaign ads. This is especially true if you aren't a moderate. It gives you more visibility, but 99.999 of the time you aren't going to change anyone's mind. Money doesn't buy elections. At the end of the day your vote is all that matters, and how influenced is your vote likely to be by smear ads? On the other hand, most people look to the few major news sources (CNN, MSNBC, Fox) for their actual information when it comes to campaigns and making decisions. People seek out news that agrees with them and are then fed selective soundbites that influence their view of a candidate. If you're conservative, you go to Fox, if you are liberal, you go pretty much anywhere else. People tend to be less skeptical of their news sources just because it is the news. Now hopefully I don't need to explain why this is bad. Obviously the majority of news sources are bias, and there is a plethora of instances of false reporting. Why do people get so upset about Citizens United? I feel as though more than anything it is a scapegoat for people opposed to republicans and corporations. I don't feel as though reversing it will prompt any real change. I also don't feel like those opposed to it realize that there are plenty of motives that are likely to be held by democrats that aren't any more justifiable than republicans. Democratic candidates get most of their funding from unions, which, as far as I understand, aren't corporations and would still be allowed to donate (could be wrong). If that's true, it seems like one could easily argue that its a political power play to cut Republican campaign funding. If it isn't true, It can still be seen as the same thing. TL;DR: People may not have morally sound reasons for opposing citizens united, and the media has significantly more of an effect on elections than money. Hello, users of CMV!

        "In spite of the cries from some media sources that Obama is a socialist and that socialism is bad, I firmly believe the opposite is true. Obama is definitely not a socialist and that a little more socialism in the U.S. will help our country prosper. In addition to the socialized institutions we have now: police, fire department, public schools, postal service, etc. we should also have socialized health care, higher education, and utility services that everyone depends on like electricity, natural gas, and water. I have heard interviews that expanding the Medicaid program for more families to be eligible to 'buy in' would be much cheaper than the 'Obamacare' bill as it stands now. New York already had a similar program in place with Family Health Plus and Child Care Plus, but I think broadening the income eligibility would be a great solution, even if buyers had to pay the full premium. I had to pay the full premium as part of a child support order (78week) and would gladly pay that for myself or other members of my family. Some communities already have co-ops (publicly owned utilities) that are much more reasonable in price than private or corporate-owned utilities. I have yet to find someone in the service area of a co-op complain about their service. The city I live in sold their publicly-owned (municipal) water company to a private entity. No change in service, yet the cost of water and sewer service has literally tripled since the change. I think these are essential to public well-being and should not be monopolized by a for-profit corporation. The only compelling argument against this I have heard so far is that private corporations will spend more money on RD and innovative technologies. I think advancements and new technology will still happen in the universities, grant-funded research, and so on. Not paying profit margins for these things would give people more liquid assets to spend elsewhere, which in turn would benefit privately owned companies in the long run, just in other places, and ultimately stimulate the economy into a boom. [Edit: I understand that this isn't exactly socialism... but it's a lot closer than what we have now.] [Edit 2 - Clarification: My idea of \"publicly-owned\" is more along the lines of a [Utility Cooperative] where \"Each customer is a member and owner of the business with an equal say as every other member of the cooperative, unlike investor-owned utilities where the amount of say is governed by the number of shares held.\" I am not necessarily advocating utilities be \"government-run",
        "I trudged through the sandstorm. I was heading north to more hospitable lands, away from this desert. At most I could make out the paved road beneath my feet. I bet my eyes would be gouged out by the sand if I didn't have these goggles. My skin would probably be ripped apart if not for this thick suit. Although, this potentially deadly sandstorm drove away slavers and bandits, which would be a fate worse than death. I brushed sand off my watch as I covered it and brought it to my face. I had been travelling for hours. At this realization my stomach grumbled. I needed to find shelter to eat something. I couldn't remove my face coverings outside. This sandstorm must be huge, the largest I ever moved through. Lady luck came to my side though. I had bumped into a metal box - an automobile. A contraption I heard was used before the crisis. There were dents from bullets and the two side windows in the front had been shattered. A traveller must have restored one and made himself a prime target. Or perhaps someone tried to hide from bandits in this? No matter, I could make use of this. I entered the vehicle. Sand was still blowing through and was piled inside. I took one of my knives and cut apart the leather seats. I put the sections I cut out in the top of the car door so when I closed it, the leather would be secured. I used my knife to attach it at the bottom to cover the open windows. I did the same to the other side. With no more sand blasting through the car, I removed my goggles and face covering. I opened my backpack and grabbed a bottle of water. As I slumped down in the back seat to rest, I noticed something poking out of sand beneath the front driver seat. Out of curiosity, I unburied it. It was a small piece of grey plastic. It had what looked like a glass window on it. It had small buttons on the side. Some kind of handheld electronic device. Alas, it did not turn on. It had no handcrank to charge it. It was pre-crisis, when things like batteries and chargers were more common and hand powered devices were not common like now. I didn't have one of the coveted solar chargers either, not that it would work in the sandstorm. As I ate my rations, I decided to keep the device. I figured it was an entertainment device. I had no use for it. Survival was more important. Fun was quite low on my priority list. However, I might be able to trade it away. I had no time to fiddle with something as useless and pointless as this.",
        "An injury-time dropped goal by Ronan O'Gara stole victory for Ireland from underneath the noses of Argentina at Lansdowne Road on Saturday.O'Gara kicked all of Ireland's points, with two dropped goals and five penalties, to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. An impressive Argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. The Pumas shocked the Irish early on with a try from Federico Aramburu, and Felipe Contepomi kicked 14 points. The well-drilled and sharper Pumas out-played and out-thought Ireland in the early stages. Indiscipline allowed Argentina's Leinster fly-half Contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. He was on the mark again two minutes later when Argentina shocked a ragged Ireland with the first try of the game. Ireland turned the ball over and Manuel Contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner Aramburu to sprint in under the posts. O'Gara finally got Ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for Contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. Playing into a strong wind and rain, Ireland continued to come second best in tight situations, and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. O'Gara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute, but once again Contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. The second-half started as the first had ended. O'Gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute, but Contepomi matched it three minutes later. The upper-body strength of the Pumas never allowed Ireland to take control up front, while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. Ireland had to rely on O'Gara's boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. The Munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. And Ireland's chance came when Argentina's number eight Gonzalo Longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. O'Gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. But Ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow O'Gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous, if fortuitous, comeback.",
        "After watching two of his silent shorts, 'Elena and her Men (1956)' is my first feature-length film from French director Jean Renoir, and I quite enjoyed it. However, I didn't watch the film for Renoir, but for star Ingrid Bergman, who  at age 41  still radiated unsurpassed beauty, elegance and charm. Throughout the early 1950s, following her scandalous marriage to Italian Roberto Rossellini, Bergman temporarily fell out of public favour. Her next five films, directed by her husband, were unsuccessful in the United States, and I suspect that Renoir's latest release did little to enhance Bergman's popularity with English-speaking audiences {however, she did regain her former success with an Oscar in the same year's 'Anastasia (1956)'}. She stars as Elena Sokorowska, a Polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts, bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere, before promptly abandoning them. While working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished General Francois Rollan (Jean Marais), she finds herself falling into a love that she won't be able to walk away from. This vaguely-political film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy, as long as you don't take it too seriously; it's purely lighthearted romantic fluff.<br /><br />Filmed in vibrant Technicolor, 'Elena and her Men' looks terrific as well, a flurry of bright colours, characters and costumes. Bergman's Polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self-absorbed, not in an unlikable way, but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions. She is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince General Rollan to stage a coup d'état, knowingly exploiting his love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a \"guardian angel.\" Perhaps the film's only legitimately virtuous character is Henri de Chevincourt (Mel Ferrer, then Audrey Hepburn's husband), who ignores everybody else's selfish secondary motives and pursues Elena for love, and love alone. This, Renoir proudly suggests, is what the true French do best. 'Elena and her Men' also attempts, with moderate success, to expose the superficiality of upper-class French liaisons, through the clumsy philandering of Eugène (Jacques Jouanneau), who can't make love to his servant mistress without his fiancè walking in on them. For these sequences, Renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a Marx Brothers film, but the film itself is so relaxed and laid-back that the energy just isn't there.",
        "Accies travel to Ibrox for what will be Caixinha's first game in charge. \"It changes slightly because it is a little bit unknown how he best thinks to set up the players he's got,\" said player-manager Canning. \"If he comes in and does a good job and it is something you can learn from as a young manager then great.\" Caixinha took over on Monday, the day after Rangers recorded a creditable 1-1 draw away to city rivals and Premiership leaders Celtic in Graeme Murty's last game as caretaker manager. Canning thought it would be \"good for the game\" in Scotland if the 46-year-old Portuguese proved to be the standard of coach that could improve Rangers. But he is hoping he can outfox the former Santos Laguna and Al-Gharafa boss when his side visit Ibrox. \"I don't know much about him, but I've checked back at his previous clubs to see how he's played, but that is dependent on the players he's got,\" said Canning. \"I think he will come in and want to put his own stamp on it straight away. \"I don't think he'll feel the need to stick with what they've been doing. \"He might if he thinks that's the best way to go about it and it mirrors his philosophy and how he wants to play.\" Accies held Rangers to a 1-1 draw in the opening Scottish Premiership game of the season at Ibrox and then suffering a 6-0 beating there in this month's Scottish Cup quarter-final. \"The atmosphere in the stadium will be a little more intense than it would normally be,\" Canning predicted. \"The new guy has come in and the players will be desperate to impress, the fans will want to get behind the team and it will be a very similar atmosphere, I imagine, to the opening day of the season. \"We need to make sure we stand up to that again and we need to do our own job.\" Canning was pleased how his players had handled the occasion at the start of the season - and for much of the cup game despite their heavy defeat. \"Watching back the 6-0 game, for the first 45 minutes we were very good then we concede straight after half-time and four goals in the last 10 minutes,\" he added. \"I think the scoreline in that game doesn't reflect the game. \"I think it was a strange game of football and I don't think we can look at it and say we've taken a beating.\"",
        "There are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall it's not very good. Limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal. The character design looks like a cross between the original Star Wars Clone Wars and Disney's Kim Possible, (Brendan, the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to Ron Stoppable in Kim Possible) Background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark, yet by today's standards, overall it is still poor and cheap looking. Many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern European or Nordic animation from the mid 80's, nice in its own way but for modern child audiences, used to CG slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind, is sure to disappoint. The story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors aren't overly impressive, noticeably the usually brilliant Brendan Gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part. There are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly cliché and stereotypically racist. However, some of the characters are good, the Viking villains, although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound. There is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by Wolves from a Viking attack that is very nicely put together. The look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film Watership Down including a blatant rip off/homage to the Ghost Rabbit of Inlay. The look is also clearly and obviously inspired by Gaelic/Celtic/Anglo Saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look. The film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner, including a pretty match cut and a large scale Viking attack that is very moody and impressive. Best of all though is the music, much of the background music is melodic and moving, specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers. If the whole film was as poetic as this moment, (and it tries,) then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience, but instead it isn't a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesn't stand up to modern animation standards. Overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways, but all together not great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment. Oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time, not sure how that was possible.",
        "THE TENANTS began as a 1971 short novel by the now deceased Bernard Malamud - writer/philosopher - examining the conflicts between Jews and African Americans in the incendiary atmosphere of Brooklyn at the time the book was written. As a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real: as transcribed into a screenplay by novices David Diamond and Danny Green (who also directs) it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final moments.<br /><br />Harry Lesser (Dylan McDermott) is a Jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his 'newest' book ten years into the writing. Convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started. he is the sole tenant in a condemned Brooklyn tenement owned by Levinspiel (Seymour Cassel) who constantly tries to 'buy out' Harry's lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished. Into this atmosphere enters another Black militant quasi-anti-Semitic writer Willie Spearmint (Snoop Dogg) whom Harry befriends, hides, and offers help to the nascent novelist's attempt to write about the death of all white people. Harry's attempts to help Willie lead to conflict, not the least of which is Harry's meeting Willie's girlfriend, the white Jewish Irene Bell (Rose Byrne) at a less than friendly gathering of Willie's militant black brothers and sisters. Willie and Irene are on the skids and Harry gradually falls in love with Irene and they plan to leave New York as soon as Harry finishes his novel. When Willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by Harry, Willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers. The ending 'reveals the slippery nature of the human condition, and the human capacity for violence and undoing'.<br /><br />The actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters. The cinematography enhances the story, keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building. The musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters. Though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings, the film in the end is worth watching. At least it attempts to recreate Malamud's bizarre look at life in the big city.

        "Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Denbighshire, was closed more than three years ago and a report found some patients were treated like animals. It has emerged that at least seven patients' families were told treatment may have contributed to their deaths. Betsi Cadwaladr health board said an investigation was under way. It acknowledged the quality of care provided could have been a contributory factor to the deaths of some patients. A review of mortality rates on the ward has never been published although it is understood it has been completed. Relatives of one patient told BBC Wales Today they were told medical care on the ward was inadequate. Correspondence seen by the programme included an apology from the health board to the family, who do not want to be identified. One letter said: \"Experts found that there were problems in the health care which may have contributed to the death.\" It added that \"the board is very much engaged in a thorough search for the truth about the Tawel Fan ward.\" But the family were unconvinced lessons had been learned and said questions remained unanswered and, as far as they were aware, nobody had lost their job, let alone be prosecuted. The scandal of Tawel Fan pushed the already troubled health board into close supervision by the Welsh Government. It remains in special measures which costs PS5m a year. An initial report into what happened at Tawel Fan was published almost three years ago. Two more reports are due later this year. One of them, being compiled by the Health and Social Care Advisory Service (Hascas), is expected to include details of a mortality review of Tawel Fan patients. But Geoff Ryall-Harvey, who leads the patient watchdog Community Health Council in north Wales, said it should be released as soon as possible. \"It may stop this practice elsewhere,\" he added. A Betsi Cadwaladr health board spokesman said: \"We acknowledge that the quality of care provided could have been a contributory factor to the death of some patients. \"Whether this is the case will be established as part of the independent Hascas investigation, which is currently being carried out. \"In order to establish whether or not the quality of care contributed to any patients' death, every aspect of every patient's care has to be investigated. \"This is a complicated and time consuming process, but must be carried out in order to determine whether or not the care provided was a contributory factor to any patients' death. \"Every family involved in the investigation will receive an individual report detailing the care provided to their relative. These reports will also help inform the findings of the Tawel Fan investigation.\"",
        "Ask Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.The Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed.Bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. To do this it makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs, makers of the Blogger software, in 2003. In 2004 MSN introduced its own blog system and Yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.\"The universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers,\" he said. Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. \"Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites,\" he said. It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone. \"Our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away,\" he said. Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. \"Being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right,\" said Mr Lanzone. Rumours about the acquisition were broken by the Napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from Ask Jeeves insiders.",
        "Agnes \"Nan\" Paterson Hardie (5 October 1885 – 27 June 1947) was a Scottish labour movement activist.\n\nLife\nHardie was born in Cumnock in Ayrshire, Hardie was the daughter of Keir and Lilian Hardie.  Hardie was then a prominent mining trade unionist, and he later became the first leader of the Labour Party.  Keir believed that Nan would be his political heir, and spent a large amount of time discussing politics with her, and introduced her to other leading figures in the movement; notably, John Bruce Glasier, with whom she retained a long-term friendship.\n\nNan left school at the age of fourteen but, three years later, became seriously ill, suffering from pleurisy and appendicitis; although she recovered, she suffered with poor health for the remainder of her life.  She accompanied her father on many speaking trips, including one to Nova Scotia in 1912, until 1915 when he became ill; Nan and her mother looked after him until he died, later in the year.\n\nIn 1924, Hardie married Emrys Hughes, a socialist journalist, and she spent much of the next decade assisting him in his journalistic and political career.  In 1933, she herself was elected to Cumnock Town Council, on which she served as convenor of the Public Health Committee.  In 1935, she succeeded her husband as provost, and the two together waged a long campaign for slum clearance and their replacement with council housing.  This was massively successful, and by 1939, three-quarters of the town's population lived in council houses.\n\nHardie took a particular interest in children's activities, founding a park and lido in the town, and also promoted cycling.  She was appointed as a magistrate, and during World War II chaired the Cumnock War Work Party; although, like her husband, she opposed the conflict, she was keen to assist in the welfare of those serving in the force and their dependents.\n\nIn 1946, Hughes became seriously ill, and Hardie tried to resign as provost.  Instead, the council persuaded her to take a leave of absence, but the process of caring for him damaged her own health, and she died in June 1947.\n\nReferences\n\n1885 births\n1947 deaths\nScottish Labour councillors\nPeople from Cumnock\nWomen provosts in Scotland\nWomen councillors in Scotland",
        "It means the country has outpaced China's economic expansion for two quarters out of the last three. Forecasts were for growth of about 7.3 for the period compared with a year earlier. However, the country adopted a new way of calculating growth, which some experts say distorts the real picture. The country's annual growth for the year 2014-15 was 7.3. Despite the robust growth numbers, India's government and its businesses are hoping the country's central bank will move to cut lending rates again soon to give the economy a further boost. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already cut its benchmark lending rates twice this year, but left its rates unchanged in April. New method The government revised down India's growth for the period October to December 2014 to 6.6, compared with the same period the year before. Its previous figure was 7.5. But it also now says growth between July and September was 8.4 rather than the 8.2 earlier stated. Economists have warned the data needs to be treated with caution since changes were made to the way in which the GDP figure was calculated. Narendra Modi marked a year in office as prime minister this week and these stats suggest the economy he pledged to improve is, well, improving. This would have been the third successive quarter of India's economy growing faster than China's. But because India has revised down the figure from October to December, it means China was still ahead in that period. And it's worth saying lots of people believe India's GDP figures are overstating the reality - and that's because other economic data - such as factory output and export figures - do not support the view that things are picking up strongly. The country's new way of calculating GDP has baffled analysts since its release earlier this year. India said the new formula is closer to international standards. But analysts have said the new data do not correlate with other economic indicators, including industrial and factory production. Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics said: \"The economy is not as strong as the GDP numbers might suggest. \"The numbers should not have any bearing on policies and both the central bank as well as the government should look at other activity indicators. \"For example, auto sales have dropped sharply this year, while bank lending growth had slowed to rates not seen in over a decade.\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who won last year's general elections, promised to reform and revive the economy and to attract much-needed foreign investment. But many say the country is yet to see any of the \"big bang reforms\" he promised to deliver.",
        "Welshman Davies won his second gold in Italy with an F42 discus world record after his shot success on Sunday. Hermitage also won gold number two with a world record in the T37 200m. Weir claimed his third gold, again leading home team-mate Richard Chiassaro, this time in the T54 800m. There was also a superb silver for London 2012 double bronze medallist David Devine in the T13 1500m after over three years out injured and for veteran Graeme Ballard (T36 100m), while Stephen Miller (F32 club) and Isaac Towers (T34 200m) took bronzes. Davies had a best throw of 54.14m, beating his previous record of 49.59 and his winning margin in the event, which is not part of the Rio programme, was more than eight metres. \"I am absolutely delighted with that result,\" said the 25-year-old. \"To throw a personal best on the main stage is something every athlete wants to do. For me, I was even more shocked because I haven't been doing too much discus this year as I have been focusing on the shot put for Rio, but I know there is a lot more in the tank. \"I know I can throw a long way but the fact that I am surprised myself is very exciting.\" Hermitage followed up her T37 400m success with another superb performance, clocking 27.21 to beat France's Marie-Francois Elie's 28.35 set at the 2013 Worlds in Lyon. \"I'm just so happy to get the world record and win a second European gold medal,\" she said. \"The 400m on Monday was very pressurised but the 200m isn't a Rio event for me, however it is something I still really enjoy. I went into it a lot calmer and more relaxed so maybe that helped.\" Devine was overhauled late on in his race by Poland's Lucasz Wietecki but the 24-year-old Liverpudlian, who only returned to training in December, had mixed feelings on his comeback. \"It is obviously great to win a medal again but I'm a little disappointed that I wasn't strong enough to hold on for the gold,\" he said. \"I've only only raced three times since London so it is bound to take some time to get race fit. Give me a couple of months and I'll be able to hold them off. \"There have been so many times when I have wanted to quit but my mum and dad told me I couldn't because I had too much talent and was too good to give in.\"",
        "I awoke to waves dancing on my feet. It was daytime, but no sun hung in the sky and there was no heat from the light. There was no breeze or sound, just a shoreline against the sea. I couldn't help but think of being at home, it was like waking after a heavy snow. Everything felt so peaceful. So quite and balanced. \"There really is nothing like it, is there?\" He stood directly behind me, cloaked in darkness and shadow. It was nightfall behind him, creeping up to the hillsides that covered the beach from the empty mainland. He seemed tired, like he hadn't slept in centuries. \"Is this what death is like? Am I to stay here forever?\" I couldn't help but feel that this, like all things, was temporary. \"No\" He said, gazing off into the vast sea. \"Most people resist their death, kicking and screaming the whole way. You on the other hand, you're different. Its not often I have the pleasure of meeting someone who accepts death.\" I got to my feet and stood next to him, gazing out at the sea. \"What does this mean for me? What happens to everyone else?\" He let out a small sigh. \"Everyone's fate is their own. What is important is that you have a choice to make. You can come with me and find the true beauty that awaits in death, or you can go back again.\" \"I can go back? Will I survive the cancer this time?\" A smirk crept from the corner of his lips. \"Not quite, you'll be born again in another time.\" \"Is that even possible?\" \"Time is only linear in life, it disintegrates and becomes fluid after death. Most mortals struggle with this, feeling like they wasted their time. This causes them to become angry at their demise, hateful of death and resentful of life. With the acceptance of death you're offered a choice.\" \"If I go back, will everyone I know be dead?\" \"They will be gone, yes.\" \"What about my memories? That's all I have left of the life I lived.\" I could tell that he was pondering something. \"I'll make you a deal. You can't keep your memories all the time, but they will come back to you in dreams. In return, you must take a walk with me when we meet again\" \"What happens then?\" \"I show you the beauty beyond death, you will shadow me and take my place temporarily.\" \"For how long?\" \"Time is fluid remember? Someone will replace you eventually, when the time comes.\" He turned to me, hope was lingering in his eyes. As we stood there underneath the edge of day and night, Death extended his hand, smiling. \"Deal?\" \"Deal.\"",
        "All of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of Disney Studios' last productions, here comes something that should heal your wounds... Once and for all, A Bug's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake \"hand-made-old-Disneys-like\" drawings (see the Lion King, Pocahontas, and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that Bambi's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever).<br /><br />A bug's life (1001 Pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks !) succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say \"Hey, this thing is computer generated !\". No weak parts, a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets, an astonishing 3D bird (close to perfection in its imitation of reality)... and that's only to mention the technical aspects.<br /><br />The scenario, my friends, the real backbone of a motion picture, has some thickness ! Curiously, and obviously thanks to Lasseter's team, there is practically no musical sequence in A bug's life. Which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate, but most others dislike (same thing for the parents or the anime fans, like me). This movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase : the 3 Amigos ; it had basically the same background story (a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen (who finally turn to be actors) to protect them, etc...). Simple, but efficient, and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects.<br /><br />Since Microcosmos, many movies tell tales of insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I do think that A bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all. The humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved... And the whole audience was captivated by Flik's (aka Tilt in France) adventures.<br /><br />A big thank you for Lasseter's team, especially for the last 30 seconds... it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs/actors forget their lines or hit the camera...<br /><br />And finally, especially for those of you who have seen the french version, other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie. A bug's life is a really good piece of entertainment, and I think it will soon become part of my collection of videos (a privilege granted to extremely few movies, and that's not a problem of storage room :). Go and see it, that's an order.",
        "I very nearly walked out, but I'd paid my money, and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of \"A New Hope\" and the thrilling sophistication of \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I remember awaiting \"Return of the Jedi\" with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).<br /><br />From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair, this \"film\" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.<br /><br />Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from \"A New Hope\" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: \"I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich.\"<br /><br />There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.",
        "Georgia Rule has got to be one of - if not the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp, \"what?\" out loud at least 7-10 times throughout its grueling two hour course.<br /><br />Advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as the matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter, and Lindsay Lohan as the rebellious, over- sexed, scantily clad grand-daughter, the viewer thinks this will be a cliché, light, chick-flick about growing up and coming together as a family.<br /><br />Talk about false advertisement at it worst.<br /><br />After many shots of animals doing \"funny\" things in the background of \"pivotal\" scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctor's office weekly to have her diaper changed, or the fact that this movie is actually about Lindsay Lohan's character being sexually abused by her step-father, Georgia Rule creates its own genre of cinema : The ungrounded, horribly acted, inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward, surreal, strange way. If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama/comedy, then he should have watched The Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. Junebug. And so on. And so on.<br /><br />The only way I feel I can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that Georgia Rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation. Say that the movie, The 40 Year Old Virgin, was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child. But instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn, belly laughs and comedy would ensue, with all of the characters' reactions being that of fake, lifeless, human beings pretending to care. <br /><br />Throw in a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney as the flattest, most non-dimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script, along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy, too-tanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he, as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene, unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other, and you've got Georgia Rule.<br /><br />I found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, etc..who have a lot more talent and aren't getting noticed.<br /><br />Don't see this movie : my rule. <br /><br />And if you must, get sufficiently drunk before hand.",
        "I slowly wake as the sun rises from the ocean. The first morning it was breath taking, almost surreal in its beauty. Now all I see is the death that will almost assuredly come. All I can do now is wait. The first day after the crash was the easiest, because I still felt the poisonous appeal of hope. I told myself time and time again that one day I would awake to the distant buzz of a helicopter or a boat or anything for fucks sake. Now I know the truth, the awful, gut wrenching truth that I will never go home. I will never see my wife's smile as I come home from work. I will never again have the chance to be angry at my children for breaking some stupid material thing. I will never hear them giggle at another joke I looked up just for them. I look around for the beacon that I once worshiped more intensely than any deity. I see it next to the palm fronds that I had attempted to make in to a shelter. Silly me, how could I ever think to get a reprieve from this undying torridity. It was still blinking that hateful, mocking light that had provided fuel for my hope for the first week. I remember when I found it after the crash, almost crying, praising the heavens for bestowing this precious gift to me. Now I know it was just a slap in the face, salt in the wound if you will. It's nothing but a reminder that I will die here with no one looking for me, but still I look ever day. I check it's still blinking, and in some small corner of my battered soul I refill my daily supply of idiotic, pointless hope. I check nonetheless. After I check my artifact of pain, I proceed with my daily routine. I walk over to the emergency pack I found along with the beacon, and get one of the small water packets that I found within. Carefully, I rip the top off and gingerly pour the contents down my throat. God I hate the taste of this shit. It's like I'm chugging a pack of chlorine. I don't know how much more I can take this. It gets harder everyday. Forcing myself to eat and drink these rations when I know that I just delaying the inevitable. All I want is for it to end one way or another but I'm too much of a puss to end it myself. Regardless of how it ends I hope that my family never has to see me afterwards. Hopefully I just won't wake up tomorrow.",
        "Bombs work by rapidly releasing energy , which in turn heats up the air / material around it and causes an explosion . Imagine a hill and a ball . The hill is a little bit special , it has a small groove at the top so that the ball can sit there stabily , but the grove is n't so deep that you ca n't push it over and down the hill . Now , there are a couple key states to note : The ball being at the top of the hill , and the ball being at the bottom of the hill . If the ball starts in either of those states , it kinda just sits there . However , if you decide to push the ball out of its groove and down the hill , it will have a lot of energy by the time it reaches the bottom of the hill , which will be released into whatever it hits . This is kind of how bombs work as well . Non - nuclear ( conventional ) bombs use chemical reactions ( reactions between atoms ) . The chemicals inside the bomb are capable of being in multiple states . By design , they are first in the high energy state ( ball on top of hill ) , before before being pushed into a low energy state ( ball bottom of hill ) . This transformation is from one set of chemicals to another set of chemicals , releasing lots of energy in the process . Nuclear bombs are pretty much the same , except instead of the changes of state happening between atoms , it happens within atoms . After an atom gets to about the size of an iron atom , it gets harder and harder to pack more protons and neutrons onto it ( it 's like pushing the ball up the hill ) , so when some manage to get knocked away , it releases energy . Pound per pound this actually releases A LOT of energy compared to chemical reactions , which is why nuclear weapons are so much stronger . As for nuclear fallout , it 's still pretty similar . Nuclear weapons release / create a lot of atoms that are unstable . They have a bad neutron / proton balance and are akin to a ball on the top of a hill with just a itty bitty groove , that is very easily knocked into releasing its energy ( technically , it does n't require a knock , just time ) . This release of energy can happen when the atom is a part of human cells , or can just pass through and knock some things around . This actually happens all the time because the world is filled with radiation , but too much of it can be hard for your body to handle , causing cancer and other issues .",
        "I can't say what the job is, for obvious reasons, but it's an extremely secure job in the sense that I'd honestly have to almost kill a baby at my desk to get fired. I have to do next to no work all day, I get 45 days of PTO (Paid Time Off) throughout the year, and I have a great pension, but I only have two years vested into it so far. I can retire at 55 and continue to not lift a finger for the rest of my life. Health benefits are some of the best in the the United States, and I get a bunch of other benefits like free legal counsel, assistance with homeownership, a free life coach if I want it, etc. All sorts of stuff. The downsides? Well, the actual salary is extremely low (not for the workload, but for life) at roughly 40kyr. Yes, I do understand that the benefits packages and whatnot balance it out a bit. That doesn't change the fact that my in-pocket after taxes and whatnot is about 30kyr. It's hard to live in the NYC Metro area on that, even if my fiancee makes almost 80kyr. The other downside is simply the work. As I said, there's almost none of it. Case in point? I'm on reddit at 9:45am, at my desk, in the middle of the office, in front of everyone around here, typing this very CMV, and no one cares. Par for the course around here. Others are on Amazon, browsing for shoes, buying patio furniture, possibly even sleeping. Who knows? Tax dollars hard at work here. Point is, I can't stand it. I went to college, but didn't graduate because I'm a shmuck, for Network Administration. I'm desparately passionate about mobile tech and the industry at large, and I'm a writer at heart. I've always dreamed about using all of my knowledge and passion in a career, but alas, here I am, not doing so. Now, here's the conundrum: I believe in the itch I have. I'm itching to quit, move my fiancee and I somewhere we can afford, and take a job (Ok, I'd take the job before I quit) somewhere that utilizes my passions and skillsets. Why shouldn't I? Edit: Since I don't think I was clear in my view, it's simply that I don't think the fact that someone has a cushy government job with a pension is ever a reason to not take opportunities to go pursue your passions in life. I think it's worth \"throwing away\" for happiness elsewhere. Edit 2: I guess I should mention, I'm only 26 years old.",
        "Ulli Lommel's 1980 film 'The Boogey Man' is no classic, but it's an above average low budget chiller that's worth a look. The sequel, 1983s 'Boogey Man II' is ultimately a waste of time, but at the very least it's an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously. Now II left the door open for another sequel, and I for one wouldn't have minded seeing at least one more. One day while I was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall I came across a film entitled 'Return of the Boogey Man.' When I found out it was a sequel to the earlier films I was happy to shell out a few bucks for it...I should have known better. Though the opening title is 'Boogey Man 3,' this is no sequel to those two far superior films I named above. Well, not totally anyway.<br /><br />Pros: Ha! That's a laugh. Is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung? Let's see...it has footage from 'The Boogey Man' and, um...it's mercifully short. Yeah, that's about it.<br /><br />Cons: Where to start? Decisions, decisions. First of all, this movie is a total bore. It goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening. The acting is stiff at best. The \"actors\" are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before, and probably none since. The plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written. The direction is just plain awful. The director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around, lights flicker, and with filters, but it adds nothing. The music is dull and hard to hear in parts. Ties to the original are botched. Suzanna Love's character was named Lacey, not Natalie! And the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978. Also, if this has a 3 in the title, why is there no mention of what happened in II? Finally, this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genre.<br /><br />Final thoughts: The people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves. It's one thing if that had been an original film that was the director's first and sucked. But instead it's supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece, but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this. If there ever is another sequel, which I doubt it, then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by Lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror film.<br /><br />My rating: 1/5",
        "The ex-Middlesbrough assistant, who held the same post at Hartlepool under Colin Cooper from 2013 to 2014, succeeded Ronnie Moore on Wednesday. Moore parted company with Pools after Tuesday's 2-1 home defeat by Stevenage. \"The quality I've seen in training, the intensity and the tempo took me by surprise a bit,\" Hignett told BBC Tees. \"I'm walking into a positive situation. Results and performances haven't been the same, the group of players I've seen today are more than capable of beating teams in this league.\" Former Tranmere and Rotherham boss Moore helped retain Hartlepool's Football League status last term after his appointment in December 2014. However despite a run of four straight wins at the start of the campaign, form tailed off and Hignett will go into Saturday's home game against Yeovil looking for a first win in five with his side four points above the relegation zone. \"First and foremost we need to get away from where we are,\" he added. \"I need to get my message across to the team quickly because there will be a change in style.\" Liverpudlian Hignett is a self-confessed relaxed and jovial character, but says that will have no impact on his performance with reference to Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. \"Tell Jurgen Klopp that [you have to be serious], there's a time to be serious and a time where you don't have to be,\" he added. \"I do like a laugh and a joke, but when I'm serious I'm serious, there's a time and a place. \"Training we have to be serious, match-day ultra serious, but after the game - win lose or draw - I'll be me. \"If I want to have a laugh and joke afterwards, as long as the result isn't too bad then I will.\" Since Hignett's last stint on the Pools' touchline, the club has been taken over by JPNG - led by chairman Gary Coxall - from Ken Hodcroft and IOR Limited. \"I was really impressed by what he [Coxall] had to say,\" Hignett added. \"What he wants to do with the club in the future, how he wants to grow the club, his vision, he wanted a clear identity for it - everything I'd want to bring to a football club. \"For me it was the perfect fit.\"",

        "We never believed that the end would come, that the dawn would rise again. Every 300 years our moon orbits the world below us, this world is our guardian, it protects us, shelters us from all that the vast expanse of space has to offer: but it could not shelter us from itself, on the far side of the moons orbit lies a vast and ancient race, their empire sprawls across the planets surface and every 300 years, when our moon comes within striking distance they attack. It is said that when they do they bring with them giant beasts, created of the most foul magic, beasts of flesh with hearts as cold as ice. Our weapons could never stand against them, we never stood a chance. so when it came in 599 CE, the year of our holy father I huddled in fear in our capitol.My armies were in position to protect the citizens here, but I knew we stood no hope, our guns, as useful as they may be would never stand up against the might of the empire and so it was that on the turning point of the day we saw them come, and they came with the dawn. Vast ships pummeled our surface with rains of fire as the dawn swept across our land, melting the ever frozen landscape. Their armies landed on our surface, weapons firing some sort of plasmic mix. I watched my city crumble around me as the fighting raged on, then, then it happened. A sound like the great bellow of some ancient beast shuddered from within the earth itself; and with it they came. Hulking creatures in the shapes of men, my eyes adjusted slowly to the new light as I focused in on the great beasts that would be our doom. I watched them huge machines, not flesh but etched metal, rise and form into ranks. The Empires soldiers marched up main avenue right towards the metal horde that was slowly collecting outside our main base within the city, our last bastion. our only hope. In between the two armies, a small child wandered into the street, clearly having lost her mother and searching for anyone to car. My heart wretched as I saw one of the soldiers level its weapon at her. and my scream of pain filled the room as it fired. But as the smoke cleared I saw only a metal body, covered in plasma, shaking it off as if it were nothing more than fresh snow, and behind its protective metal shell sat the little girl. and I beheld the glory, of the new dawn.",

        "\"The EU needs a complete overhaul,\" says Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung. \"The remaining union has to learn from the Brexit vote and carry out the most fundamental examination of its policies\" since its creation in 1957, the paper argues. Der Tagesspiegel agrees, and tells the EU to \"reform or be destroyed.\" But it also warns that there is a \"shocking gulf\" between remedies offered by the political elites - closer integration, especially in economic terms - and the expectations of ordinary Europeans. The answer, it concludes, is \"more openness, more transparency,\" as well as a stronger focus on welfare. Under a picture of French and Dutch far right leaders Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders, an article in Der Spiegel voices alarm at the rise of the \"great simplifiers,\" saying they threaten democracy by appealing to the irrational. \"The populists are on the loose, and not just in Great Britain,\" it warns. \"They are dragging Western Europe towards its downfall.\" \"Populism is tearing Europe apart,\" a commentary in Spain's El Pais agrees, but warns that any changes to the EU should not try to appease their \"anti-establishment\" discourse. \"Populist parties have grown by exploiting the idea that the EU is to blame for an economic crisis caused by the whims of the markets,\" it argues Instead, it calls for policies that \"promote stability\" and \"reject blaming Europe for our ills when it is part of the solution.\" An article entitled \"the dictatorship of democracy\" in El Mundo voices the fear that other countries could follow Britain's example. \"What is disturbing is that, after Brexit, fools can say with greater strength and certainty:'Yes you can. In Italy's La Repubblica, a commentary says the vote for Brexit reflects rising general discontent by the \"excluded\" that is driving the rise of the likes of Donald Trump in the US, as well as of Italy's own populist Five Star Movement. On the website of Polish news magazine Polityka, commentator Andrzej Celinski warns against \"giving in to the wave of nationalism,\" and appeals to Poles to end what it calls their hesitant approach to the EU project. \"In the face of a real threat to the [European] Union, Poland's political leaders must stand together to fight for European unity,\" he urges. \"Do not follow the British. Build Europe.\" An article in Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza agrees, saying that the anger felt by many EU citizens must be channelled into a desire for a \"stronger Europe and better democracy, not nationalist phantoms.\" BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

        "Eric Bikubi, 28, and his partner Magalie Bamu, aged 29, have been convicted at the Old Bailey of killing Kristy Bamu after accusing him of being a sorcerer who practised witchcraft. The couple, who live in Newham, acted after accusing Kristy of controlling and adversely influencing a young boy, the jury was told. They originally came from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where witchcraft is called Kindoki, and exorcisms are carried out in some churches. In 2010, Unicef reported 20,000 children accused of witchcraft were living on the streets of DR Congo's capital Kinshasa. In the DR Congo, accusing a child of being possessed is a criminal offence, a law that has been in place for several years. But in 2008 I travelled to Kinshasa to see if it was making any difference and, at that time, the answer was not at all. Which is why I found myself in one of the city's slums late at night knocking on the door of tin-roofed shack that doubled as a church. Pastor Tsimba let me in and showed me three children who he had diagnosed as having Kindoki. The youngest was probably six, the oldest no more than 12. They had been in the church for days, deprived of food and forced to work. Their parents were paying for the privilege. The only light came from flickering candles and storm lamps. The pastor began to shout and pray. One by one he brought the children up to the front of the church. He ordered them to lie down and, still shouting and chanting, began slapping their stomachs, one, two, three times. Each harder than the last. Then he took a candle and poured burning hot wax on them, leaving them grimacing and squirming but making almost no sound. Their eyes were wide and staring. Finally, as a bizarre conclusion to the ritual, Pastor Tsimba produced a length of pipe and held it hard against their belly buttons. One after another, he made a play of sucking hard on the pipe and in triumph then spat a lump of meat he claimed to have sucked out of them into a bowl. The meat he claimed had been been fed to them by a witch, infecting them with Kindoki. The children, bewildered and quiet, were now in his words \"delivered.\" I alerted a social worker to the plight of the children. An extraordinary and dedicated man, he said he would do all he could to help them. But his unit had not paid him for months, there was no money for petrol or even a bus fare. So he did his work on foot. He walked miles each day, visiting as many churches as he could, in this sprawling city of nine million people.",
        "I've had it with this. I'm out. Wait, the door's unlocked? That wasn't expected..... What, you mean there's no-one here?! So how have I been fed? Watered? Clothed? I feel them. Crawling all over the place. Monsters, tiny little things. I didn't kill that girl, you know. She killed herself. I was just the divine tool. The dog, though, that was me. Doing God's work. I find the refectory. It's empty. The walls, they bleed. Like the righteous. Or the corrupt. A siren, sings. Alarm? No. Maybe. Yes? I hear them. Empty chairs at empty tables. Sadness. A weaver. Deceit? Could be. Not seeing. F'taghn? Wharr? It's empty. Like me. Nothing but God. Nothing but Satan. Nothing but bleak. The paint, it peels. Feels like honey. Broken honey. I feel them again.

There's nothing left for me here. I've seen through their lies. I will walk out of here. Once I am reborn. I must seek a river and a pastor. To be baptised. To be drowned and born anew. To cleanse myself of my past insanities. I thought I was doing God's work. I was a fool, blinded by those taunting angelic voices. I must ignore them, now, and get back to normal. And the drugs don't work; they just make you worse, but I know I'll see your face again. I'll carry my sins where no-one will see them. I push the doors out. It's time to begin again. This part is done.",
        "Intelligence in dog breeds is a tricky question . Thing is , different dogs are bred to do different things . A doberman or a border collie are working dogs bred for problem solving abilities and a willingness to modify orders based on available information . ( A collie needs to adjust its path to herd sheep , for example , even if they 're being whistled another way . ) Chihuahuas on the other hand were essentially bred to be house alarms . Their purpose is to make a hell of a lot of noise whenever strangers get near their territory , while being small and compact enough to make their upkeep minimal . Of course there will always be outliers , individual dogs with traits contrary to their breed standard , but * in general * you 'll be unlikely to find a chihuahua who 's naturally inclined towards learning obedience tricks , or a collie who does nothing but sleep under blankets and freak out whenever strangers come over . Does that mean one breed is stupider ? Not necessarily . It means they 're both specialized . One just is n't specialized towards being an independent thinker . That said , I own a chihuahua . He 's intelligent enough to have a clear theory of mind ( i.e. he understands that other people and animals have different information available to them than he does ) and is capable of manipulating the cats into feeding him . He can also pick up when I do n't want the cats doing a certain action ( like messing with my laptop screen ) and will police them to make sure they do n't . However , he will also compulsively bark at anyone who comes in the door even if he knows who they are . Is that stupidity or is that just a behavior hardwired into his little brain from generations of selective breeding ? Hard to tell . Anyway . Working as I do with puppies I can say for absolute certain that there * are * some breeds who 're on average dumb as rocks , while there are others who 're always way too smart for their own good , but from what I 've observed this seems to have nothing to do with size and everything to do with breed function . By far the less intelligent puppies tend to be companion breeds - dogs that were never meant to do anything besides sit around looking fancy . The smartest puppies tend to be the ratters or independent hunters . Somewhere in the middle are companion hunters who listen very well but tend to lack common sense . It 's all really fascinating , actually . Edit : But yeah in answer to the question , border collies are smart because they were bred for herding which requires high intelligence . Brain size is n't as important as wiring .",
        "I thought, struggled, and tangled myself in my own thoughts, that is, when I was able to tell me own thoughts from the devouring voices of pain, they called, screamed, and yelled \"I'm nigerian prince with money for you! \" , \"Meet hot singles in your area today! \" , \"Doctors hate him! \" , they went on and on, I felt the need to scream, to scream within a prison of my own mind. The clock was ticking, and I was being pressured and pressured into the questions, the voices of the stream wanted to burst out of my head, but I was struggling, struggling with my life to keep the monster in its cage, I gazed a gazely stare at the sheet of paper that had become the bane of my life, it was then that I wished that I had died a long long time ago. I stood up and stumbled like an injured ox to the corner of the room, slamming my sweaty palms on the moldy wallpaper of the dull room, I was under a cocktail of emotions, anger, sadness and confusion spewed upon my existence, the harsh reality of my actions was being poured into my soul. Pilot, a teacher from The Tech Nexus opened the door, his eyebrows furrowed at the sight of my misery, which at this moment was acutely displayed by my fetus position, crying, murmurs and wails. \"LEAVE ME ALONE, LEAVE ME ALONE, I DO N'T WANT SINGLES, PLEASE.\" I screamed, the poor man falling back at the sight, I turned looking at him, suddenly devoid of emotions, this only made him more frightened as I stepped forward, fists clenched. I stood up, continuing my even stride towards him with eyes so wide that my eyelids seemed to have disappeared, as I reached the unstable man I had given up, I put my arms on his shoulders, putting my face up close to his, I gazed a gazely stare, I spoke into his eyes. \" We must have died alone, a long long time ago. \" I sank my pen into his neck, his huff of questioning at my earlier remark deformed into a shriek midway, I did not regret it, I felt forgiveness, I was clearly stressed, I had to channel the feelings of anger within me, the chip in my brain stopped sending trash into my throat, and instead began to send alerts to the local law enforcement, I knew what I had to do to stop my pain, and I was going to keep doing it, again and again, and no one was to stop me. With that conclusion, I smashed a window open with a bloody hand and hopped down, laughing in ecstasy.",
        "[ ] (dropcap) \"AUGH! Sonuva James wasted no time in grabbing his rifle and opening the front door. At the side of the house was a man wearing a blue uniform with a red-and-white nametag. Paul. He stayed a safe distance. At least ten feet. Not that Paul was going anywhere. \"Who are you? What are you doing here?\" \"Don't shoot, don't!\" The man cowered behind his bloodstained hands. \"Do you live here? Please, can you get me out of this bear trap?\" \"Answer my question.\" He sobbed, trying to wipe away tears and smearing blood on his face and shirt. \"Look, I'm just here to check the gas meter!\" \"No one touches that gas meter without my say so! I have called that company seven times! \" James' hands shake with rage. \"Has ANYONE in that company seen Highway Man 3?\" \"I can't die here! I can't die, I can't die...\" He rocked around in the fetal position until a new outburst of blood poured from his thigh. \"AAAH!\" \"You've been following me!\" \"What? No.\" He did not sound at all convincing. His voice sounded weak. Pathetic. \"You are! You're here to kill me!\" James switched his grip on the gun. Paul's breath was fading, and his eyes began to flutter. But Jason was not going to let him have the satisfaction of dying. Not yet. It took some time to drag Paul around to the cellar door, and even longer to take him down the stairs to his workstation. James put a tourniquet on his leg to stop the bleeding. Then he tied Paul up and waited. Paul awoke, immediately straining against the ropes. James noticed, and picked up a rusted handsaw. \"What kind of killer are you?\" \"What?\" \"Why are you after me? Is it demons? Or are you just some sick, twisted monster?\" \"Please. Let me go. I have a family. I have kids.\" \"It doesn't matter.\" James ripped the saw through Paul's elbow, and he screamed in pain. \"You're a killer. You're getting what you deserve.\" I watched the entire ordeal through the small window at the base of the house, which peeked into the cellar. He never saw me. It was easy to check the spot for traps now that I knew what I was looking for. The scene unnerved me. It wasn't right. James was not supposed to kill people. I was supposed to kill James. He'll be more alert now. Paranoid, yet vigilant. This will not be fun at all.",
        "They stopped calling it a \"death penalty.\" Those liberal lawmakers finally got their way. Outright killing of mature human beings was suddenly considered a form of cruel and unusual punishment, but they decided that exile would be just fine. The first few waves of arks arrived filled to the brim with supplies and criminals, but I thankfully wasn't among them. 10,000 criminals sent alone to a cold rock without a society is a recipe for disaster. Despite killing each other on a regular basis, they managed to set up some cursory habitats and start the mining processes. They weren't building up or out this time. They built down. All that remained on the surface were solar panels. I remember the mortality rate was nearly 90, which was just fine with the Terrans. They considered their hands washed of the blood. You'd be surprised how quickly society evolved here on Mars. The founders of our government did have some fine examples upon which to improve. They decided to go with a social democracy; there were few enough citizens and plentiful technology that there was no representation. Everyone cast an individual vote, and it worked shockingly well. Perhaps not so shocking considering any newcomers who didn't want to participate were faced solely with the prospect of walking out an open airlock. I made the trip in the fourth wave of arks. Won't bother you with the details; let's just say I deserved to be on that ship. Every one of us was allotted a certain quantity of materials with the expectation that we would eke out our own existence, but that wasn't quite how it happened once we'd landed. A Mars citizen gave us a briefing, and all of our supplies were confiscated to be meted out amongst the population as needed. I was given a bunk, and a list of possible employment. It took a bit, but I finally came around. It's been a satisfying life. Now the problem is the damned immigrants. Earth hasn't been faring well with the burden of overpopulation, pollution and global warming. People want to emigrate somewhere to make a better life for themselves. Hardly a day goes by when you don't see a couple illegal landers burning in across the sky. There've been some discussions on what to do about the undocumented people arriving on our planet, even thoughts of a damn space wall, but no consensus has been reached. At some point we'll reach critical mass and have to enact some policies, but I honestly don't mind the Terrans. They're doing honest work for pay that no Mars citizen would consider accepting. Plus, we have no way of rounding them all up and sending them back to where they came from. (Thanks for reading this. I've always wanted to submit one of these!)",
        "Lately I've been seeing a lot of uproar by people who, having successfully completed higher education and obtaining a diploma, experience difficulty in getting a job. I don't think that the problem lies within the educational system or the job market. I'll be blunt: I think the reason these people cannot find jobs is either their lack of skill at or passion for this particular field they've studied. Studying at Uni, I witnessed a lot of people around me who firmly held to the \"college - diploma - job\" plan, without really showing much excitement for what they're doing. No overextending, no participation in field-related extracurricular events or discussions, no desire to expand their knowledge via sources outside of the scheduled curriculum. They mechanically stuck to the routine of going to lectures (or not), studying for exams and passing exams and occasionally visiting talks on career opportunities. On the other hand, there were also many people who simply radiated passion for what they were involved in. They would do all these things that the aforementioned group did not do. Even through very simple things like their general demeanour and even their facebook statuses, you could tell they were extremely interested and motivated with their undertaking. And when it comes to job hunting, I am certain that the second group will have a much higher success rate in actually landing a job. Now, I'm not saying that you have to be a nerd, or an exceptionally gifted individual. But you definitely have to be involved and immersed. Ultimately, I believe that the root of the problem is society's expectation and weight placed on the importance of getting a degree as a means to achieving a worthwhile life experience. I am no sociopolitical genius, so I obviously can't readily provide a solution to this. However, it would seem appropriate that there should be more focus paid to other means of acquiring a job. For example: pursuing a trade, specialising in non-university courses, even establishing a profession as a familial legacy, etc. But in any case, there should be fewer people attending higher schools, as too many people visiting them are simply wasting their time.

        "God It's always difficult making tough decisions and this year I've made the hardest one of all, to eradicate sin and give humans another chance to embrace a new world. A world of peace, love and kindness where there will be no more tears. Of course in order for this to happen I have to prevent humans from actually doing sinful things, limiting their free will. Now I've debated this for eternity - literally - but to be honest, if I don't step in the Nuclear war in 2018 would eradicate 99.9 of the human race. I know what you're thinking, surely at that point I could step in and utilise that disaster as a fresh start. Although I see your point, I'm still experiencing the backlash about the flooding. So with that, on entering the year 2016, sin will leave the world. Every human will no longer be capable of sin. Satan Let's get something straight, I've always wanted the best for the human race. Think about it, back in the beginning with adam and eve, there was no sin, no free will to do anything you wanted. After I stepped in humanity had unlimited potential. Sure there's been war, famine, disease and death but there's been some remarkable things of human acheivement. I think you'll agree that God's plan to remove sin and thus freewill is a huge mistake. If anything he should go the opposite way, if he removed the linearity of time then nothing in the lives of humans would be predetermined. God Well a few hours in and already the world is changing for the better. For the first time, humanity all over the globe have united in wokring towards a better future. Money is no longer a concern and communities are aiding one another in anyway they can. Within the year the world should be unrecognisable, poverty and hunger no longer existing and humanity living in harmony with the earth. Satan So its only been a few hours and already I'm enjoying this more than anticipated, I didn't relise how unrewarding temptation was in the old world, people just caved so easily to their darkest desires. This new world, well this is a challenge. Even in Eden I had that tree of knowledge to play with. I've been working on quite a few things so far, sticking to the classics; wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. All I need is one person to break, then its only a matter of time before the world one more begins its decent into chaos. This is going to be fun.",
        "The Scot dug deep to claim a 2-6 6-4 7-6 (7-4) victory in a match that lasted two hours 59 minutes. He recovered from two breaks of serve in the third set, his opponent serving for the match at one point. Murray now faces Austria's Dominic Thiem in the last four. Ramos-Vinolas, who is at a career-high world ranking of 19, capitalised on a string of unforced Murray errors to take the first set but was pinned back in the second as the Scot battled back to level. In Monte Carlo, Murray had led 4-0 in the final set before capitulating to a defeat to Ramos-Vinolas. In Barcelona, it was the Spaniard who held a final set lead, winning the first two games before injuring his foot attempting to receive a volleyed return, which led to a lengthy period of treatment. The incident initially benefited Murray, who won the next three games, but Ramos-Vinolas steadied the ship and looked set for victory after breaking in the ninth game. However, Murray dug deep and immediately broke back before taking the match to a tie-break that he largely dominated and clinched on his second match point. \"It was obviously a very tough match,\" said Murray. \"It was kind of the opposite of the match we had last week where probably today he deserved to win. He created a lot more chances, he served for the match and couldn't quite get it. \"Last week I had 4-0 [in the third set], I felt like I had all of the chances. Sometimes on clay matches happen this way, so very happy to get through.\" Rafael Nadal, a 10-time winner in Barcelona, joined Murray in the last four courtesy of a 7-6 (7-1) 6-2 win over Korean qualifier Hyeon Chung. The Spanish 14-time Grand Slam champion, 30, takes on Russia's Karen Khachanov or Argentine Horacio Zeballos in the last four. Britain's Aljaz Bedene continued his winning run with a straight-sets win over second seed Ivo Karlovic to reach the Hungarian Open semi-finals. British number four Bedene broke the Croat's serve early in both sets on his way to a 6-4 6-3 victory, and a 15th-straight win. The 27-year-old, ranked outside the top 100 at the beginning of March, has climbed to world number 68. He faces fourth seed Fernando Verdasco or fellow qualifier Laslo Djere next. Bedene came through qualifying in Budapest to reach his first ATP Tour semi-final since January 2016. He also won back-to-back titles on the second-tier ATP Challenger Tour earlier this month. The clay court specialist has now won 22 of his past 23 matches, with the only defeat coming on hard courts at the Miami Masters.",
        "I grew up watching the old Inspector Gadget cartoon as a kid. It was like Get Smart for kids. Bumbling boob can't solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard the live action movie was decent so I checked it out at the library. I rented this movie for free and felt I should have been paid to see this.<br /><br />Broderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting Don Adams had as the voice of gadget. His voice was all wrong. The girl who played Penny looked nothing like the cartoon Penny. She is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. But she does do a decent job given what she had to work with. Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby. Saldy he never hid in any odd place or had exploding messages tossed at him accidently by Gadget.<br /><br />The gadget mobile was wrong. It never talked in the series and it did fine. Why did they do this?<br /><br />Gadget was too intelligent in this film. In the show he was a complete idiot. Here he had a halfway decent intellect. It would have worked better if he was a moron.<br /><br />Also the completely butchered the catchphrase. Borderick says \"Wowser\". It is and should always be \"Wowsers\". It sounds lame with out the 's'. I got upset when they showed the previews and they didn't have the correct phrase.<br /><br />The ONLY decent gags were during the credits. The lacky for Claw is in front of a support group for recovering henchmen/sidekicks. Seated in the audience is Mr. T, Richard Keil aka Jaws of Bond movie fame, a Herve Villacheze look alike, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is about the only part I laughed at.<br /><br />The other is at the end where Penny is checking out here gadget watch and tells brain to say somethin. Don Adams voices the dog saying that \"Brain isn't in right now. Please leave your name at the sound of the woof. Woof.\" of course this isn't laugh out loud funny, just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. He should have at least voiced the stupid car.<br /><br />Kids will like this, anyone over 13 won't.<br /><br />",
        "I kind of put a twist at the end but just so it would be a little different. Tried my best to stick to the plot outline. Have you ever gotten that feeling? The feeling of just being, well lack for better words, scared? Well, that's what I felt like when I, James Legstrong got to mars. It was a long trip of about 3 years but it was worth it. We had been orbiting for the past day and had been looking for the best place to land. We decided on a nice clearing where there was some mountains nearby. After confirming with home, we got ready to rocket down to the red planet's surface. Even getting into the atmosphere, it looked like nothing I had ever seen before. Beautifully red and orange, it was the greatest thing I had ever seen. I also had an amazing feeling because I would be, along with my partner, the first people to ever set foot or lay eyes on it from this distance. We landed and had to put on our suits before we went out. My partner and I both shook hands and said that we stick together, while also doing the U.S salute. This was not only being broadcasted on live television, but listened to by most of the world. It was a monumental achievement. I stepped foot out first, with a big grin on my face. I looked around along with my partner and I noticed something quite... Strange. There was another space pod already landed nearby. We contacted home only to see that it was not ours, or anything we'd sent out previously. It was even in an odd shape with a disk. We decided that we'd approach with caution. We got as close as we could, only to see that there was an imprint on the side of the pod. It was covered in the red dust so we had to wipe it off only to see something horrifying. At first it was just red, but as we got to the corners, we could see some yellow, then we saw it. It looked like a flag. My partner and I wanted to go in badly, but couldn't until we got confirmation. After a while of arguments between staff and others but they finally gave us permission. The pod door opened with a woosh sound of air flowing out. We got in to see a carnage of materials, notebooks, and clothes flung around. There was some type of creatures there. We were given directions not to touch them though, as they could be contaminated. There was also computers, so we decided to look through them. It had no password so we got on easily and opened a summary of the people on the vessel. After looking through we saw the species of these creatures, they were called... humans.",
        "\"Are you okay John?\" \"Mr. President? John?\" \"Let me get this straight.\" He stared at the slides until the silence became painful. The Joint Chiefs shared a look but no one spoke. \"So just to be clear.\" The President said slowly rubbing his eyes. \"This isn't some sort of prank?\" \"Jo- Mr. President, this is very real.\" Adams stood in the center of the room waiting. The President blinked at him a few times then indicated with a wave of his hand that the man should continue. \"As I was staying sir.\" Adams continued as if there wasn't a pause in his presentation. \"The Cartorniums, as we call them, wished to proceed with real time communications. We went ahead with their designs and in'87 had the first long distance FTL communication with another species. In conjunction with our partners we have moved onto phase nineteen. Mater transmission or rather matter-pattern transmission,\" He paused at his own joke but noticed the looks from others and continued. \"is viable for several AU. The Lunar base \"We have a fucking moon base?\" The President asked. Adams turned to look at him and blinked twice. \"Well no sir, according to the treaty that is the Russians. We have Mars and Io. As I was saying longer trips have proven..... troublesome. The project we are currently working on uses several new satellites as well as the ansible array with mars to better triangulate the local gravity wave distortions and allow a more cohesive data transmission.\" \"So there are aliens.\" The President said flatly. \"Why am I not telling the American people?\" \"Ahem, the Kennedy accords sir.\" Adams said softly. \"What?\" Adas looked around the room but no one seemed willing to speak. \"Until the, errr, dominate lifeforms, that would be us sir. Until they put aside, and we believe the word here is silly or foolish or the like, notions of fate gods or destiny and come to understand their actions are theirs alone...\" Adams trailed off slowly suddenly remembering someone said they feared what another died-in-the-wool family-value republican would do to the working budget. \"Can't sir.\" Adams said into the silence. \"They worry what so many...... religious people, would do with that knowledge. As Clinton said, \"If the world learns the world burns.\" Though..... That is we are not allowed to tell the general population at this time.\" \"They have an issue with God?\" The President asked quietly. Adams always the literal, logical, scientist smiled. \"Oh no sir, no problems with any Gods, only those that believe in them.\"",
        "While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to win the Democratic nomination for a myriad of reasons: (1) Huge swaths of Democratic blocs have little-to-no idea who he is. Working class Democrats, Blacks, Hispanics are all in the same boat. The only people who have a vested interest in him are college students and certain areas of the internet. No one seems to be addressing this huge discrepancy either, making the whole thing reek of another \"Ron-volution.\" (2) Our economic problems aren't behind us by any stretch of the imagination, but we are slowly recovering and the media seems to be shifting its focus toward international affairs such as ISIL and Russia. Hilary has the advantage here as a former Secretary of State. If something happens between now and the election, it would only further her lead. (3) This one is a bit shaky, kinda sexist, and based on personal antidotes, but here it is. Mrs. Clinton is a woman. I remember in my class a few months back a straw pole my professor conducted an informal poll of who was going to voting for who and why. Almost unanimously (professor included) were in favor of voting for Hilary on the sole qualification that she was a woman and that would be good simply because it would signal to other women that they could have a career in politics. I don't necessarily agree with this mentality, but you can't argue that a lot of people will vote for her for that reason simply because of that \"progressive\" position. (4) Even if Hilary gaffes and scandals her way out of the nomination and hands it to Bernie on a silver platter, Republicans are going to have a field day turning this into a shit show. Mud will be slung at the Radical Vermont Socialist who'll just continue Obama's policies. Corporate interests will pile the money on. The Baby Boomers will come out in full force and vote for whoever the GOP will push out simply out of fear. A good chunk of Americans don't believe in global climate change, how in the hell are they going to vote for a socialist? I will admit that my opinion is incredibly jaded. I will also admit once more that I really want to see Bernie win, but I just can't imagine a universe where that happens. Edit: There has been a lot of great debate over the last 12 hours about this issue. Ultimately, I can't count this as fully persuaded\"Bernie is going to win the nomination and take the White House.\" However, the never has changed to an itty bitty maybe baby. It is smaller than a gnat's stomach, but its there. Regardless, keep debating you magnificent bastards!",
        "Not quite a superpower, but is a gift that comes at a great cost. The Letter I wake, and I find the love of my life Jeremy lifeless holding my body. He isn't breathing, he isn't moving. I am the one who is sick, yet he is the one that lay lifeless. \" Why \" I scream. What have I done to deserve this. What has he done to deserve this. It is at this moment that I realize he has a letter in his hand. I begin to read the letter. It's almost as if I can hear his voice again as I read this. Lana, You are the love of my life. You have always been there for me, you have always been my strength. I still remember the day we met, the day I first laid eyes on your long curly brunette hair and your beautiful green eyes. I knew you were out of my league. I knew there was no way I could be with a girl as amazing as you, or so I thought. You saw me sitting alone at the bench at the park one day. Instead of passing by as everyone else did, you came and sat down beside me. You sensed I was distressed. You asked me what was wrong, you heard my stories. You shared in my pains and in my sorrows. There are not many who I can say that about, and none but you who have stayed after hearing them. It was then I knew you were someone different, someone special. You brought light into my life, gave me a sense of purpose. The last 10 years have been filled since joy and passion, and I have you to thank. Your love has been the greatest gift given to me. Yet here I was tonight, holding you in my arms and I could do nothing to help you. I begged to the heavens, to anyone or anything that would listen to save you. I saw you dying in my arms and there was nothing I could do. I felt so helpless. It was in that moment that I heard a voice. It was death. The Grim Reaper if you will. I was told he needed to collect a soul. It didn't need to be hers, but if not it needed to be given willingly. I struck a deal with death to take my soul in place of yours. I had an hour to say my goodbyes, and hence this letter. It is you who has saved my life, who has given me a life worth living for all of these years. It is now my turn to return the favor, I shall save your life as you once saved mine I have and always will love you now and forever. Love, Jeremy As tears fall down my face I whisper \" Now and forever .\"",
        "I pull my beat-up old Accord in the driveway, throw it in park, yank the e-brake for good measure. But I don't turn it off. I sit in the warmth, hesitant to walk outside into the snow. Nothing particularly good's on the radio, but I leave it on anyways. We're fighting. Well, at least \"fighting\" in the way we do, the way we try to out-morose one another..... I don't want to talk to you. You've texted me every hour on the hour, and with each one you add another stupid crying face emoticon. I started deleting them two hours ago. The snow falls harder, and I can tell the hike to the house is just getting worse by the minute. I turn the key, take it out slowly. I always liked the way the key bumps out of the ignition, and sometimes I like to savor that. I check the e-brake again. I don't want my car rolling down the hill, I might have to call you to come dig me out of the snow again. The door feels like it's sealed shut. Or maybe the weight of last night's pseudo-argument is keeping me in. I'm sick of your non-confrontational bullshit, and my car knows it. I push past that though, manage to wrestle the door open, get my feet out. Standing feels like I spent a month in zero-G and am on earth for the first time again. This weight's good, though, makes me feel attached, like I won't just drift off into space. The walk to the door is the longest, coldest walk of my life. The stairs are a mountain, the snow a glacier, but then there's the door, and my key in my hand, and the lock clicking open, and then the handle creaks and the hinges grind. And then he's there, all bouncing and wiggling the stump of his tail, tongue lolling, whining just a bit, running figure eights through my legs my wonderful, beautiful, fluffy sheepdog. And the weight of you is gone, and in its place is fur on my jeans and spit on my gloves and paws on my coat. I'm laughing and I'm crying in relief all at the same time. I throw my phone on the counter, keep my gloves and boots on, and grab his leash because I don't care if it's dumping snow, he and I are going for a walk. I'm glad that some day I will die knowing that at least one being one furry, messy being loved me completely and utterly without condition.",
        "But is the issue the result of local factors or a symptom of a more fundamental issue? The number of teacher vacancies in the north east, Highlands and the Northern Isles is relatively high. In many other parts of the country, there is no significant problem filling most teacher vacancies. Council umbrella body Cosla says the problem is in what it calls particular \"pockets\" of the country - rather than a national problem as such. In each of the last four years the Scottish government has increased student teacher numbers. It also argues it has addressed teacher unemployment and stabilised teacher numbers in recent years, and has dismissed any suggestions of a Scotland-wide shortage. There are a number of possible explanations for the problems in northern Scotland. For example, the cost of housing in some parts of the north east - an important factor in the overall cost of living - may deter people from moving there if they know their salary would go further in another part of the country. Young people In rural areas, it can be a challenge to find the right person for any skilled job. Young people from rural areas who want to become teachers will usually have left home at 18 to study - many may simply not fancy returning to a rural community, at least while they are in their 20s or 30s. It is important to distinguish between the drop in the overall number of teachers in Scotland in recent years and the all-too-real challenge some councils face filling advertised vacancies. Councils across Scotland are now committed to trying to maintain teacher numbers - the current council funding deal with the Scottish government makes this a formal obligation. But filling vacancies requires, of course, finding the right candidates. Councils in the north have tried a number of ideas - promoting what they believe to be the advantages of living in their area, for instance, or providing free accommodation. Different challenge One contentious issue is over just who can become a teacher. All teachers in Scotland have to register with the General Teaching Council for Scotland, but teachers from outside Scotland have to meet specific requirements. The biggest number of teachers from outside Scotland come, inevitably, from the rest of the UK. However teachers in England who, in effect, learned on the job as graduate trainees through the UK government's Teach First initiative cannot register in Scotland. Head teacher vacancies throw up a different challenge though. Head teachers are often promoted from within their own council area - they may go for a promoted post at their own school or a nearby school. If these vacancies are unfilled, it may beg questions over why some people appear not to want promoted. One recently claimed to BBC Scotland that the amount of bureaucracy and extra work for a relatively modest rise in salary meant that some may not believe the promotion to be worth it.",
        "Patients often die before their 40s as mucus clogs and damages their lungs and leaves them prone to infection. A major trial on 1,108 patients, in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed a combination of drugs could bypass the genetic errors that cause the disease and may increase life expectancy. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust said it could \"improve the lives of many.\" One in every 2,500 babies in the UK has cystic fibrosis. Errors in sufferers' DNA - inherited from their parents - damage the microscopic machinery that controls salt and water levels in the linings of the lungs. The result is a thick mucus that inexorably damages the lungs. Antibiotics help prevent infection and drugs can loosen the mucus, but nothing deals with the fundamental problem for most patients. The combination of drugs - lumacaftor and ivacaftor - were designed to repair that microscopic machinery. The trial showed that those patients given the cocktail for 24 weeks had better lung function. Cystic fibrosis also affects the mucus lining in the gut so the doctors were pleased to see the patients also gained weight in the trial. Prof Stuart Elborn, who led the European part of the trial from Queen's University Belfast, told the BBC News website: \"This is very exciting and it really demonstrates that we can correct the basic defects in cystic fibrosis. \"This is likely to become a fundamental treatment for cystic fibrosis. \"Starting in children may prevent the disease process developing if we correct the basic defect early in life. \"Will this improve survival for people with cystic fibrosis? We would anticipate it would have a really good chance of doing that, but we don't know for sure yet.\" There are however, many types of error in the DNA that can culminate in cystic fibrosis. This treatment combination should work on around half of patients, while one of the drugs on its own corrects a small proportion of errors. New treatments are still required for the remaining patients. Susanna McColley, professor of paediatrics at Northwestern University, said these were \"groundbreaking findings\" that showed the future of treating cystic fibrosis. She told the BBC: \"For subjects I've cared for, they felt better in ways that are not necessarily measurable. \"One young woman said, and this is a direct quote, her CF'is not a problem'.\" Janet Allen, the director of research at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust charity, said: \"These results open up a new front in the fight against cystic fibrosis and this combination therapy looks set to be an important additional treatment option that could improve the lives of many. \"As this leading edge of science continues to be explored and better understood, we are hopeful that a future of personalised medicines is increasingly within reach.\" The therapy is being examined by regulators around the world.",
        "I believe this nation has a permanent scar from the Civil War. The war itself was so brutal, but so much effort and hope has gone into reconciling the two sides and yet here we are: I think it is clear that Civil War resentments have never gone away and form the basis for many of this country's divisions to this day. You can see it economically, demographically, religiously, culturally, and it of course permeates every corner of our politics. The Tea Party is basically a direct parallel to some of the anti-Lincoln movements in the build up to the Civil War. Issue after issue, obviously many of which are complicated, but you can often draw a straight line back to the war. In each new era we've had to refight along the same battle lines. From the beginning the South did not act like Germany after WWII, they were determined to defend the Old South and come up with Lost Cause myths, which have become ingrained into their very DNA at this point. It's clear they are never going to get over it. I'm sure they would say the same for the North. Maybe saving the union was a noble idea, but it doesn't feel like it ever played out as a success. Has it been worth trying to maintain this Union all this time, between two sides that seem to be fundamentally and permanently incompatible with each other? I personally would like to visit certain southern towns, and I like some music and food and have many southern friends and so forth, but I have very little attachment and a lot of disdain for the South as a sociopolitical influence and I feel I wouldn't miss a thing in the North if they seceded. For many of them the feeling is more than mutual. The resulting two countries could still be diplomatic allies, but politically we would be out of each other's way and would be so much more unified and functional internally. The elephant in the room is slavery. If anybody tries to claim that BS that slavery wasn't the cause for the war, I can promise you no deltas. I can't stand the thought of slavery lasting a day longer than it did, so I'm sympathetic to the \"if the Union wasn't saved, slavery would've gone on\" argument, but I want more than that. From a larger historical perspective, I just don't feel that the Civil War divisions are ever going away and as a result, they poison the US. Like a married couple long overdue for a divorce, maybe it's time. CMV. EDIT: Here are some articles that demonstrate my premise. I don't consider it very disputable that we are still dealing with the Civil War's aftermath. I'm more interested in hearing some strong reasons why I should be glad we decided to \"save the union\" after the war and why I should still be against southern states seceding. Or maybe you believe that the Civil War rift will indeed heal and we'll be better off for it.",
        "I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying this was shameful, and embarrassing to the US military, a ridiculous simplification. To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on. I think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true. That's why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns: for the killing of people and the breaking of things. Sure, not every member of the military's job is to be a killer, but those people are there to support the killers. The cooks, mechanics, engineers, and secretaries are all there to let everyone else kill people and break things as safely and efficiently as possible. Again, I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective. I am certainly not condemning anybody, just stating facts. Most people I've seen disagree with Huckabee are just dancing around this. \"Soldiers exist to protect the United States and her interests!\" Sure, using violence or the threat of violence. \"The army doesn't just kill people, they developed the Internet!\" Yeah, as a weapon to coordinate their violence in the most efficient way possible. The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect. The US military is in a bit of a unique position, since they haven't had a lot of opportunities to do their job recently. Our military is so badass, there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on. Thus, a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes. That's great, but it's all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job. It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things. That's their real purpose, simple as that.

        "Communism can be thought of as conscientious cooperation between members of a society . In order for any individual to survive , he relies on others . For example , you can build a house and farm much more easily when you have another person helping . Communism relies on the individuals ' realization that we depend on each other , and thus have common interests that we have to work toward . If I raise chickens and you grow grain , we need to exchange our goods to each have a healthy diet . In essence , we cooperatively \" own \" the goods we create and we share them . So long as you and I realize that we 're better off when we cooperate , we both are healthy ( and have homes , and all the other goods that come from being a conscientious producer of goods and services ) . However . This spirit of community can be hurt by the lures of competition . If I withhold some of my goods , or try to get as much from you as I can for as little labor as I can put it ( i.e. laziness ) , then the system of cooperation starts to fail . If Bob , Susan , and I help you build your house , and then you give us none of your grain in return , we no longer have a healthy diet . In order for the system to work , you must have people realize that it only works when they believe in the system and help support the ethos through work . Some people believe communism is \" so bad \" because within such a system you ca n't want to have the biggest house , or the fanciest car , and so on . Also , some infamous societal failures in history are often associated with communism , even though they were n't really communist countries . So sometimes when people hear \" communism \" they think of those terrible events in history . For a five year old , you could also think of it like this : We drive cars , and we have lots of rules for car drivers like stopping at a stop sign . It would probably be a good idea to stop at intersections , even if we did n't have stop signs or laws regulating them , as it would make driving safer for everyone . We would be cooperating for the good of everyone . But some people break those driving rules , out of their own personal interest , and so we need ( numerous ) laws ( i.e. external forces , not internal conscientousness ) to guide our behavior . And similarly , communism is a society that thrives on understanding and cooperation , and capitalism exists based on self - interested compeition based on external forces . Communism is n't a bad idea . People are bad !",
        "\" It's quite simple actually, \" I tell the young mother. \" We will schedule weekly checkups and observe their development. Through interaction with their environment we will determine which of them has evil tendencies. Then, before a year has passed the selection will be made. \" She's looking at me, hands clasped on her baby bump. Her eyes are vacant and bloodshot. Around her shoulders her husband has draped his arm. His face is buried in her shoulder. I ignore their distress and gather the papers on my desk, neatly stacking them to perfection. \" Now, \" I continue after giving the pair some time to deal with the news, \" If you don't have anymore questions I'll see you at our next session in two weeks. \" As one, they get up and exit my office. I slowly bring my coffee mug to my mouth and sip. I feel my mouth arch into a smirk. I never cease to enjoy myself at work. I pick up the phone and dial my secretary. \" Sandy, I've just let the Beatties leave. Are there anymore appointments for today? \" I take another sip of coffee, the dark brew seeping over my taste buds. \" No sir. You are free to leave. \" \" Excellent, \" I hang up the phone and stand with a flourish. I arrange my chair and desk so that everything is perfect for the next day. Yes, I say to myself with an internal chuckle, everything must be perfect. I pass the young couple who have resorted to sobbing in the waiting room. I roll my eyes at the sight and then smirk again. As first time parents they hadn't known that all births consist of two identical twins. After all, they didn't know they themselves were born with a twin. To find out that only the ' good'twin is permitted to live is always a shock to those oblivious fools. I, as the leading expert in twin behavioral deductions, had developed the procedure and protocol that identified and eliminated the ' evil'twin. All for the sake of this ' perfect'utopia. I walk home whistling. I loved the control and power my job brought. I passed each day laughing at the population's blind ignorance. Especially since I, by the very laws I helped write, should not be alive. This Utopia had corrupted everyone into thinking the entire population was ' good '. This meant that they weren't able to recognize ' evil'even when it stole their children. My lips peel back to reveal a toothy and predatory smile. \" Yes, \" I say to the world, \" Everything is perfect. Just keep believing that and your puny little minds will have peace. \"",
        "On this 4th of July weekend it's heartening to see the spirit of the Declaration of Independence alive and well in the film \"War, Inc.\" Just as our founding fathers gave the back of their collective hand to King George III, this film exposes in hilarious fashion the craven war-profiteering by the current crop of capitalistic creeps who are intent on indecently privatizing the government, to include privatizing war itself.<br /><br />The cast in this satire absolutely shines. John Cusack is wonderful as a droll, conflicted corporate assassin, and the beautiful Marisa Tomei is superb as his love interest. (My gosh, \"George Costanza\" was right. Marisa Tomei is so attractive!) But it is John's sister Joan Cusack who really steals the film. Her portrayal of a bossy, yet simultaneously sycophantic, personal assistant is priceless, and more than once I just couldn't stop laughing at the brilliance of her performance. She not only possesses fantastic comic timing, her face is as expressive as one could ever wish for in an actor. Dan Ackroyd, too, has a short, but very effective, cameo in the film as the head of the company which is running the war, the Tamerlane Corporation. Sitting on a \"throne\" with his pants down around his ankles, Ackroyd even looks like the arse clown who currently occupies one of our real thrones of power. You won't have to think too hard to recognize that person. Much of this movie was filmed in Bulgaria, which is why we are able to see so much real military equipment. (You just know that the US military would never have cooperated in making this satiric expose of war-profiteering.) I especially enjoyed the character of \"Omar Sharif\" as played by the Bulgarian actor Lyubomir Neikov. In one scene in which he is on the dance floor with Marisa Tomei he has a couple of lines that could summarize our entire foreign policy attitude toward the foreign leaders we install - and uninstall - in power.<br /><br />Naturally, this film won't appeal to everyone. If you believe that the on-going privatization of our foreign policy, the military, intelligence collection and analysis, prisons and the corrections system, public health, and a myriad of other government services is a good thing you may not find much to like in this film. If you believe, however, that destroying people and countries in order to add to some corporation's bottom line is an abomination I think you'll find much to appreciate in this film. Nothing could be more in keeping with the Spirit of Independence that heaping well-deserved ridicule on corrupt powers that be.",
        "This feeling has occurred to me as a result of my participation in another thread here today. It will be easiest for me to explain what I mean by making reference to a couple of the arguments posted there. I feel if that was the case, the 90 should get bitchslapped upside the head with some knowledge. I don't think we should necessarily punish the ignorant, but we shouldn't indulge it either. ( This was in response to the fact that over 90 of pollees support mandatory GMO labeling.) This \"freedom of determination\" that you speak of is exactly what's wrong with the world, if we have to restrict the information of GM food so that people will eat them, so be it. Your \"freedom of determination\" will always lead to long term negative impacts. These two posts display pretty clearly what I am driving at. In the real world, things are the way they are because that's what works. It is my experience that any time I find myself getting involved in political discussions, people get caught up in their argument without actually going into or even considering how that argument might be enacted or applied in the real world. A fine example of this is the entire Occupy Wall Street movement. The core statement of that entire movement was basically, \"Things are this way, but they SHOULD be that wayso we're gonna sit around until they are.\" \"Should\" is the bane of meaningful discussion. Anytime someone says things \"should\" be a certain way, in your head you can replace the word with \"can,\" and you quickly find that the statement is false. Yeah, great, everyone should have all their basic needs met, everyone should be fed and healthy and happy. But not everyone can be, because there is no working way fathomable to get there and sustain it. Until there is, until you actually have that method and system figured out, it is completely useless to bring it up at all. The two posts I quoted above show a shocking failure to understand actual reality, because if you try to imagine either as being actually implemented in the real world, you can only get there by eradicating democracy and leaving decisions up to a select group, and that has never worked out in all of history. You can't have everything be democratic except this one decision, or that one decision. It's all or nothing. Therefore, bringing up anything that isn't \"90 of the people want it and so they must have it\" requires you to put an oligarchy in place. Just because the thing 90 of people want might be negative doesn't mean the alternative is better. You have to accept the bad with the good, because that's the real world, that's what democracy is, and that's the only way things work. Am I making my point clear?",
        "Biomarkers of aging are biomarkers that could predict functional capacity at some later age better than chronological age. Stated another way, biomarkers of aging would give the true \"biological age\", which may be different from the chronological age.\nValidated biomarkers of aging would allow for testing interventions to extend lifespan, because changes in the biomarkers would be observable throughout the lifespan of the organism.  Although maximum lifespan would be a means of validating biomarkers of aging, it would not be a practical means for long-lived species such as humans because longitudinal studies would take far too much time.  Ideally, biomarkers of aging should assay the biological process of aging and not a predisposition to disease, should cause a minimal amount of trauma to assay in the organism, and should be reproducibly measurable during a short interval compared to the lifespan of the organism. An assemblage of biomarker data for an organism could be termed its \"ageotype\".\nAlthough graying of hair increases with age, hair graying cannot be called a biomarker of ageing. Similarly, skin wrinkles and other common changes seen with aging are not better indicators of future functionality than chronological age. Biogerontologists have continued efforts to find and validate biomarkers of aging, but success thus far has been limited. Levels of CD4 and CD8 memory T cells and naive T cells have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice.\nAdvances in big data analysis allowed for the new types of \"aging clocks\" to be developed. The epigenetic clock is a promising biomarker of aging and can accurately predict human chronological age. Basic blood biochemistry and cell counts can also be used to accurately predict the chronological age. Further studies of the hematological clock on the large datasets from South Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European populations demonstrated that biomarkers of aging may be population-specific and predictive of mortality.\nIt is also possible to predict the human chronological age using the transcriptomic clock.\nThe recent introduction of low-power and compact sensors, based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) has led to a new breed of the wearable and affordable devices providing unparalleled opportunities for the collecting and cloud-storing personal digitized activity records. \nConsequently, modern deep machine learning techniques could be used to produce a proof-of-concept digital biomarker of age in the form of all-causes-mortality predictor from a sufficiently  large collection of one week long human physical activity streams augmented by the rich clinical data (including the death register, as provided by, e.g., the NHANES study).[10]",

        "The two children were allegedly snatched off a Beirut street earlier this month at their mother's behest. The operation was being filmed by four Australian journalists with Channel 9's 60 Minutes programme. The mother, Sally Faulkner, was soon arrested, as were the journalists, two British men and two Lebanese men. The children were returned to their father's custody. The judge overseeing the case has warned that he views the \"child recovery\" operation as a criminal case. Ms Faulkner had said she had not seen the young children since her estranged husband, Ali Elamine, took them from Australia to Beirut on holiday. She flew to Lebanon earlier this month with two employees of the UK-based company Child Abduction Recovery International (CARI) to recover them, accompanied by the 60 Minutes team. CCTV footage broadcast by Lebanese TV appears to show the six-year-old and four-year-old being bundled into a car by several men on a busy street in southern Beirut. They had been heading to school with a domestic worker and their paternal grandmother, who said she was knocked to the ground during the abduction. It was previously reported that the judge was pushing for Ms Faulkner to reach a custody agreement with Mr Elamine. But Mr Elamine has now said he will not drop abduction charges against Ms Faulkner because it could see the others involved released as well. Judge Rami Abdullah said on Monday that the so-called \"recovery\" operation amounted to a kidnapping attempt. \"This is not a custody case, they are involved in kidnapping two kids,\" he said, according to News Corp Australia. The case has been adjourned until Wednesday to allow both sides to negotiate. Those arrested face kidnapping, assault and association charges, which can carry a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. According to reports, Judge Abdullah interviewed 60 Minutes' prominent reporter Tara Brown and Ms Faulkner briefly on Monday before the handcuffed pair were escorted out a side exit to waiting police cars. Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been in contact with her Lebanese counterpart. \"The law in Lebanon is quite different to Australian law,\" she said in an interview with Network Ten. \"It's based on a French system, so there have been arrests, then an investigation and then an investigating judge determines whether charges will be laid and I understand we're at that stage of the proceedings,\" Ms Bishop said. Lebanon is not party to the Hague Convention, a treaty designed to ensure the swift return of children abducted internationally by a parent.",
        "The funky, yet strictly second-tier British glam-rock band Strange Fruit breaks up at the end of the wild'n'wacky excess-ridden 70's. The individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90's: morose keyboardist Stephen Rea winds up penniless and down on his luck, vain, neurotic, pretentious lead singer Bill Nighy tries (and fails) to pursue a floundering solo career, paranoid drummer Timothy Spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt, and surly bass player Jimmy Nail installs roofs for a living. Former loving groupie turned patient, understanding, long-suffering manager Juliet Aubrey gets the group back together for an ill-advised, largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of Europe. Our lovably ragged bunch try gamely, but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day. Scraggly zonked-out roadie Billy Connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist Hans Matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy, trouble-plagued, but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride.<br /><br />Director Brian Gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud, ringing, flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock in general, this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big-hearted charm and tireless verve. The astute, sharply written script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais likewise bristles with spot-on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity, capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow. Ashley Rowe's lovely, elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right-on rockin' flair and aplomb. Kudos also to the across-the-board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt-out soul and tattered, but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has-been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success. All in all, this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the 90's.",
        "Context: Almost all of the current debate that I hear boils down to \"Religious freedomYou're mean\" and it annoys me. CMV 1) In the United States, given the constitutional separation of Church and State, and current law, \"The Principle of Religious Freedom\" is a red herring, as a basis for policy. The U.S. does not recognize official religions, and thus does not recognize official spokespeople who interpret those religions, and thus there is no official list out there saying what is proscribed or prescribed for a member of any given religion. In practice each person's \"Religion\" (or system of morality) is defined wholly and completely by that individual. \"Religious Freedom,\" in this context, boils down to two more basic classically liberal freedoms. CMV 2) The more basic freedoms that are in contention are the freedom of association and the freedom of conscience, and the real argument is whether these are freedoms we should respect. In negative terms Freedom of Association: The freedom to not associate with those you do not wish to associate with. Freedom of Conscience: The freedom to not undertake actions which you find immoral. In interaction one would also have: the freedom to not undertake specific actions with specific individuals. The \"right\" is arguing that we should respect these rights2 . The \"left\" is arguing that we shouldn't. CMV 3) If the \"right\" was honest they would admit3 that their \"Religious Freedom\" arguments apply to all anti-discrimination laws CMV 4) If the \"left\" was honest they would admit4 that their \"anti-discrimination\" arguments could just as easily lead to the govt. requiring they associate with people they consider distasteful while performing acts they believe immoral. 2 for certain \"religious\" people. I would really like to see their response if people started denying services, for \"religious reasons,\" to people wearing crosses. 3 racesex discrimination is brought up almost every time which leads to a lot of hemming and hawing. 4 right now they just blabber on and on about fairness and people being mean.

        "Women are as likely as men to ask for a pay rise - but are less likely to get one, the research found. The study, by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin, looked at 4,600 workers. It found \"no support\" for the \"reticent female\" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money. For what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females. When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25 more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found. The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype. When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications. The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings. \"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\" He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends.\" \"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added. \"It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.\" The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change. Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: \"The study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior.\"",
        "Amy Pope and Sam Paterson are the first recruits to the Holywell monastic community on an estate in Abergavenny. Father Mark Soady, vicar of St Mary's Priory Church, will be their prior, leading outreach work in the town. He said there had been \"amazement\" that young people were prepared to give up their lives to carry out good works. The two recruits will initially spend a year living in a house on the estate being supported by the church while they take part in daily services and work with local people. By day they will arrange activities such as bingo for pensioners, and by night they will take to the streets to talk to young people hanging out in groups. Father Mark said the inspiration for a modern-day monastic order came from the history of St Mary's, which is on the site of a Benedictine priory which stood from 1087 until 1537 when the monasteries were dissolved. \"When I arrived here two and a half years ago I looked at ways that the Benedictine Rule of Life could pervade the life of the parish on a day-to-day basis,\" he said. \"My colleagues and I came up with the idea of a new monastic community in the spirit of St Benedict.\" Father Mark added: \"Abergavenny is a pretty rich town but we have some of the poorest wards in Monmouthshire. \"This juxtaposition of wealth and poverty makes the social divisions more marked. \"We're hoping our work will reduce these divisions.\" Unlike the monks of old, the young recruits will not be expected to join the monastic order long-term, but will be given the opportunity to sign up for a second year or seek similar duties elsewhere. Mr Paterson, 21, is from the Abergavenny area, while Ms Pope, 23, from Watford, Hertfordshire, came to south Wales after answering an advert in the Church Times. Ms Pope said the role was \"a great honour and privilege.\" \"It's been really exciting so far - Sam and I are just finding our feet,\" she said. \"We've got involved in a drop-in centre for young people, a parent-and-toddler group and we're hoping to do some work with elderly people. \"I'm hoping that if it all goes well I'll be part of the Holywell community for two years and then go onto ordination training - I'd like to work in mental health.\"",
        "India's defence minister has opened the country's Aero India 2005 air show with an invitation for global aerospace firms to outsource jobs to the nation.Pranab Mukherjee said such companies could take advantage of India's highly skilled workers and low wages. More than 240 civil and military aerospace firms from 31 countries are attending the show. Analysts said India could spend up to $35bn (£18.8bn) in the aviation market over the next 20 years. Giants such Boeing and Airbus - on the civil aviation front - as well as Lockheed Martin and France's Snecma - on the military side - are some of the firms attending the show. \"There is tremendous scope for outsourcing from India in areas where the companies are competitive,\" said Mr Mukerjee. \"We are keen to welcome international collaborations that are in conformity with our national goals.\"Lockheed said it had signed an agreement with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to share information on the P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft.In fact, the Indian Armed Force is considering the buying of used P-3 Orion as well as F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed. The US military industry has show a strong interest to open a link with India, now that relations between the two countries have improved a lot. In fact, it is the first time the US Air Force will attend the air show since sanctions imposed in 1998 after India's nuclear tests were lifted. But the Indian Air Force is also considering proposals from other foreign firms such as France's Dassault Aviation, Sweden's Saab and Russia's Mikoyan-Gurevich. Meanwhile, France's Snecma has also said it plans a joint venture with HAL to make engine parts, with an initial investment of $6.5m.On the civilian front, Boeing announced a deal with India's HCL Technologies to develop a platform for the flight test system of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft. The US company also said it had agreed with a new Indian budget airline the sale of 10 737-800 planes for $630m. The airline, SpiceJet, will also have the option to acquire 10 more aircraft. Airbus has also recently signed fresh deals with two Indian airlines - Air Deccan and Kingfisher. In addition, the European company has plans to open a training centre in India. Meanwhile, flag carrier Air India is considering to buy 50 new aircraft from either Boeing or Airbus. \"No other market is going to see the growth that will be seen here in the coming years,\" said Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president Boeing.",
        "Graeme Souness believes Walter Smith would be the perfect choice to succeed Berti Vogts as Scotland manager.Souness's former assistant at Rangers is hot favourite to take over from Vogts, who resigned on Monday. \"Walter is most definitely the ideal candidate for that job. He'd be perfect for it,\" Souness told BBC Sport. The Scottish Football Association has appointed Tommy Burns as provisional caretaker-boss for the friendly against Sweden on 17 November. \"He fits the bill because of his knowledge and understanding of the Scotland team and football. He is experienced and has been successful.\" Souness added: \"Walter is a real football person, as I know from working with him at Ibrox. \"On top of all that he is a proper human being who would command the instant respect of the players and everyone involved in Scottish football.\" Souness joined Sir Alex Ferguson in backing Smith's claims. The Scottish Football Association is about to embark on the search for Vogts successor after appointing Tommy Burns in a caretaker capacity. Ferguson said: \"He (Smith) would be the outstanding candidate as far as I'm concerned. \"You need somebody who knows what they're doing and Walter would bring a wealth of experience to the job.\" The Man Utd boss continued: \"I don't know what credentials are needed to do the job but it's a job that needs a lot of experience. \"He was my assistant with Scotland and here at Manchester United and he has also managed Glasgow Rangers. \"He would need to change the whole shape of Scottish football and radical changes are needed.\" Smith was assistant to Ferguson at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. The former Everton and Rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as Manchester United assistant last term. BBC Sport understands that Smith would be willing to discuss taking over if he was approached by the Scottish FA.If he is tempted to take over, it seems almost certain Smith's long-time right-hand man Archie Knox would also play a part in the national team set-up. Smith already has the backing of many pundits and fans, including former Scotland manager Craig Brown. Brown said: \"Walter is an outstanding candidate without doubt. \"He would be admirable choice. I spoke to him on Sunday and I got the impression he would take it. He was asking me about it and I was positive.\" Other candidates for the job include former Scotland midfielders Gordon Strachan and Gary McAllister and Vogts' assistant Tommy Burns.",

        "Wow! Stacy Peralta has followed up Dogtown and Z-Boys with an equally stunning documentary about the history of the big-wave surfing culture in America. Piecing together insider archival footage along with interviews from surfing legends, we are transported into the daring and free-spirited life of the early pioneers whose sheer passion for the sport spawned an industry that today touches the lives of millions.<br /><br />It's getting to know these icons and their stories that gives the film its warmth. You can feel the respect Peralta has for this group as we hear accounts of Greg Noll striding from a pack of awestruck fellow surfers on the beach to singularly challenge 50-foot swells off Hawaii's North Coast. Or Jeff Clark, surfing the outrageously dangerous Maverick off the northern California coast all alone for 15 years before it was discovered and became the surfing destination in California. And the storybook history of Laird Hamilton, today's surfing icon. Hearing Greg Noll reverently refer to Hamilton as the best surfer ever sent chills up my spine.<br /><br />(As an aside, Noll, Clark and others were at the Sundance screenings. Noll humbly described himself as an old, over-the-hill surfer. He was deeply moved by the audience reception of him and film. Both he and Clark were as likable in person as they were in the film.)<br /><br />Riding Giants pays homage to these extraordinary athletes while at the same time rewarding us with an insight into the magnitude and terrifying power of the waves they seek to conquer, the gut-wrenching vertical drops required to get into them, and the almost unfathomable combination of adrenaline and fear that the surfers experience each time they take on a monster swell.<br /><br />All this, and the movie has more. For those of us that didn't live in California in the 60's, we get an insight into the impact of surfing on American pop culture. (And, to my surprise, the impact of the movie Gidget on surfing!) Peralta also weaves in a primer on some of the technical aspects of the sport and the history of innovation in equipment. I'm not a surfer, but like the rest of the Sundance audience, I was absolutely captivated by this film. Peralta is staking his claim as the Big Kahuna of American documentaries.",
        "The number of British films produced in the UK fell 40% in 2004, with movies starring Johnny Depp and Jude Law among those affected, Screen Daily has said.Twenty-seven British films were made in the UK last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly. It attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the National Lottery. UK and US co-productions in Britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year.Last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK. Several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown, coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and Miramax Films. Shooting on period drama Tulip Fever, which was to star Jude Law and Keira Knightley, was postponed indefinitely while shooting of The Libertine starring Johnny Depp was moved to the Isle of Man.\"There isn't anything coming in to replace (the funds),\" said The Libertine's executive producer Marc Samuelson. \"We are in a hiatus.\" Films with \"medium\" budgets of up to £9m, a similar level to box office hits Vera Drake, Calendar Girls and Enduring Love, are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004, Screen International added. Big budget co-productions, such as the Harry Potter series, continued to be shot in the UK, however. The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production, when Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Wimbledon and Thunderbirds were all filmed in the UK.\"The drop was expected as there was no way 2003's record level of production could be bettered,\" the council's spokesperson said. \"The reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors, including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.\" It was \"too early\" to predict whether the downward trend in UK production would continue throughout 2005, the UK Film Council said. In September the government introduced subsidies worth up to £4m per film for medium budget films, under new Treasury measures. It is also due to announce a replacement for UK film tax relief scheme Section 48 in July.",
        "EDIT : Adding my * * analogy * * from below , Which I like > Imagine I have a magical deck of playing cards , where if you burn 50 of the cards in the deck without looking at any card , the remaining two are always a pair .

The cards know instantly , but no information is conveyed , since you ca n't even know * when * I burned my cards , nor can I know if you 've checked yours . ----- Short answer , which is the only one I know since I am not a smart man : The issue is that even if you could separate the particles , you ca n't know * either * state until you 've looked at them . It 's not that you have particle A with state 1 and Particle A1 with state ? . It 's that you have Particle A with state ? and Particle A1 with state ? . When either party looks at either , then it is set . So imagine you have your machine on earth , and I have my machine above the Bugger fleet . Both of our machines have paired off particles , and neither of us knows their states . Once you check your machine , all your particles are locked into a state , but you have no way of knowing whether I 've checked their states or not , and you have no way of changing their states . The same is true for me . This is why you ca n't do something like - \" check particle in box A if we are attacking the buggers , and check particle in box B if we are now their friends \" - because the act of checking your side of the machine locks the particle 's state , with no way for you to know if I 'd already checked mine .

        "I happen to be pro-choice in matters of abortion, being from a society where this is not a big-delal. And i don't find pro-life arguments very convincing. But recently I happen to think along the following, which sounded weird, but doesn't seem to have any obvious logical flaw: The main argument of pro-choice is giving enough freedom to the mother in deciding whether she wants to put herself through bearing a child. You can also say the same about bringing up the kid, modulo adoption. (Now, I happen to believe the current adoption system is not all that great and is a terrible crime against humanity to not be a good parent for your kids. If the parents themselves have found a good foster-parentsgod-parents on whom they trust, then it may be acceptable to bear a kid, whom you won't fend for. Well, this may be another CMV!;. So, why not allow parents to euthanize their babies, if they think they can't bring up a kid in a good way? Why this idea of killing a kid, is fine only when it is inside the womb? Obviously, glitch here is that, at some point, you should grant the right to own its body, to the kid. You can put some arbitrary age limit for it. The point, i am contesting is why should it be the time when it is pushed out of mom's womb? May be we can do some statistical study and see how long the right to euthanize babies is good for the society. My main motivation for this line of thought is kids with serious mental illness. It really saddens me to see such people, who will have to depend on their parents for everything and it may be a total plight on their parents to bring them up. Especially, as attachment develops, anything that makes the kid's life worse, takes a heavey toll on parent's health and wellness as well and may affect their funnctioning in the society as productive members. And i am more concrned about what happens to them after their parents! They may be left homeless!: (Frankly, i have little courage to be such a parent! TL;DR: The notion of \"pro-choice\" seems arbitrary in the sense that you have the right to abort an unborn fetus still in mom's womb. Why not make it more \"productively\" arbitrary, by having a small age limit, say one year or so, upto which the baby's life is in parents hands and they have the right to euthanize the baby? PS: I am NOT looking for pro-life argument here. You should only critcize why killing an unborn foetus is fine, but not the baby after it is born, upto a certain other arbitrary age-limit.",

        "Perhaps I would have liked this film more if I wasn't so attached to the characters in Henry Fool. To those who've never seen Henry Fool, I wouldn't worry. As Hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at TIFF, the film has lots of exposition and explanations.<br /><br />This film is very heavy in plot, which keeps the film moving. There are many humorous moments and the film certainly has Hartley's trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue. Over all, a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of Hartley who are just beginning explore his work. As for the older fans who loved his earlier works like Trust and Amateur, this film could go either way. I have mixed feelings about the film and Hartley's later films in general. What Hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations, focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other. Since his late 90s and onward, his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter. Mass media in No Such Thing, Religion in the Book of Life and now Terrorism in Fay Grim. I don't know if Hartley's talents are suited to such big subject matter or if he's able to do it justice.<br /><br />Strangely enough, the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships, a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves. The only problem is, I've seen Henry Fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film. You can tell this film was written long after Henry Fool was finished without any intention of a sequel. Somehow, the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of Henry's books of confessions as a macguffin (in the hitchcockian sense). Fay's motivations for finding Henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in Henry Fool.<br /><br />I guess I'm slightly disappointed in the film because it's not true to the characters in the Henry Fool and it doesn't exactly work as a straight ahead thriller. There's too much irony and wryness in Hartley's approach to such as big topic as terrorism. It somehow works and doesn't work at the same time. All I could say, you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on Hartley's work and how well you know Hartley's work. Fans of Henry Fool, be severely warned for a disappointment. For the rest, welcome to the world of Hal Hartley and enjoy the ride.",

        "this film tries to be immensely clever, and Tarantino-like <br /><br />before you try that though, you need solid filmic fundamentals. these include good sound, editing, set design etc...<br /><br />lets talk about the sound in this movie. absolutely atrocious. i have never been more distracted by a sound track, ever<br /><br />and before we talk about low budget, film made in Chile etc.. lets bear in mind that desent sound these days is far more achievable than it ever has been. anywhere. and more info on technique is available then ever before<br /><br />the sound in this movie is plain bad. the foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate throughout, the atmos is equally terrible. i heard at least four loud clicks during the movie, which are the result of poor sound editing. the sound inside cars is awful, the sound of car doors closing is awful. the sound of the lady singing is wrong. foley is either overboard, or simply not there like the sound person just got bored and gave up. the spaces are wrong. everything about it is wrong <br /><br />and yet, not letting limitations of creativity get in the way, at the same time the movie tries boldly to be clever. for example the sound of the aquarium is used in the following street scene. we hear sound when we're not supposed to. sound edits precede visual cuts. every trick in the book is used, and yet the foundations are just not there<br /><br />editing-wise we have scenes using heavy jump cuts, we have tinkering around with the time line etc etc etc, yawn. all of these techniques are imitated to a splendidly low standard <br /><br />overall the mix is crap, the sound is crap. and so, the film is crap. how can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered for awards and high praise? Chile's cinematic new wave? the best creative output that Chile has to offer? i hope not, and i think not.<br /><br />my theory is that Chile's more selective and better talent avoided this film like the plague maybe due to its risqué content. equally, the film has likely received so much unwarranted critical acclaim from so called 'world-cinema' enthusiasts for the same grubby reasons. they likely revel in it's trashiness. of course film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality <br /><br />this film is rubbish. it's all mouth and no trousers and is never deserving of a 6.8 rating. the film has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino, new wave inspired porno!",
        "Spain's Marta Corredera curled the hosts into an early lead before England striker Dan Carter doubled their lead moments later. Alex Scott made it 3-0 straight after half-time, before Kirsty Linnett pulled one back for the visitors. Three-times winners Arsenal will now face Notts County Ladies in the final at Rotherham on 1 November. In a repeat of the 2011 and 2012 finals, Arsenal made an energetic start and Carter struck the crossbar before Corredera's sweet strike from the edge of the area opened the scoring. Carter than raced clear, one-on-one with Sophie Baggeley, and calmly lobbed over the Birmingham goalkeeper. The Blues responded well to falling two-goals behind but Karen Carney's deflected shot was turned on to a post by Sari Van Veenendaal, and bounced back across the face of goal and clear. After the break, Arsenal made the win safe with Scott's powerful finish, before Linnett's well-struck consolation. In a bad-tempered second half, Carter drilled wide after a superb knock-down from Jordan Nobbs late on, but a two-goal cushion was sufficient to see Arsenal through. Arsenal manager Pedro Martinez Losa told BBC Sport: \"We have been starting games well. I'm very happy with that. \"The best feeling today is to offer the fans victories in the last three home games of the season. I'm proud of the players, the staff and the team. \"This is the reward for everybody's efforts. We have to do everything possible between now and the final to prepare.\" Birmingham manager David Parker told BBC Sport: \"Arsenal were the better side in the first half, that's won them the game. \"Defensive errors and mistakes in that first 20 minutes were the difference. \"Looking at the second half display, for long, long periods we were the better side and we really showed our quality.\" Arsenal Ladies: Van Veenendaal, Scott (c), Stoney, Losada (Yankey), Natalia (Ubogagu), Nobbs, Carter, Williamson, Corredera, Rose, Janssen (Sampson).

        "Dockery, who plays Lady Mary in ITV's hit period drama, will play Madame de Tourvel in the production, heading up the London theatre's autumn season. Janet McTeer and West co-star as ruthless former lovers Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont. Artistic director Josie Rourke will helm Christopher Hampton's play. Les Liaisons Dangereuses is based on the scandalous 1782 novel by Choderlos de Laclos, which told of sex, intrigue and betrayal amongst aristocrats in pre-revolutionary France. Its first theatre production 30 years ago starred Alan Rickman, Juliet Stevenson and Lesley Manville and won both the Olivier and Evening Standard Awards for best play. Hampton went on to win an Oscar for best adapted screenplay for the 1988 film version starring Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer. \"I have long wanted to direct Christopher Hampton's superb Les Liaisons Dangereuses,\" said Rourke, \"and the cast we have drawn together is a testament to the brilliance of his play.\" Along with his stage work, West has appeared in TV dramas The Wire, The Hour and The Affair, while McTeer was recently seen in acclaimed drama The Honourable Woman and The White Queen. Other highlights at the 250-seat theatre this autumn include the first major London run of Abi Morgan's early play Splendour, which will star Zawe Ashton, Sinead Cusack, Michelle Fairley and Genevieve O'Reilly. Morgan has since gone on to write films such as The Iron Lady, Shame and the forthcoming Suffragette. Splendour tells the story of a photojournalist at the heart of a coup in an eastern European state and will be directed by associate director Robert Hastie. \"One of the things that most excites me about this season is the strong leading roles for women,\" said Rourke. \"It is a thrill to announce a season of work that features, in plays by living writers, women of the calibre and power of Zawe Ashton, Sinead Cusack, Michelle Dockery, Michelle Fairley, Genevieve O'Reilly and Janet McTeer, who returns to the Donmar and the London stage.\" The Royal Court's former artistic director Dominic Cooke will direct the UK Premiere of Teddy Ferrara, Christopher Shinn's play about a student tragedy which sends a campus into turmoil. This autumn will also see the transfer of Phyllida Lloyd's all-female Henry IV to St Ann's Warehouse in New York. Lloyd has just been announced as the theatre's new associate director. Theatre fans who missed out on Rourke's award-winning production of Coriolanus, starring Tom Hiddleston, will have the chance to catch it on screen in UK cinemas as part of the National Theatre Live Encore screenings.",
        "\"What's this now?\" Cain asked he held a bloodied rock over his brother's smashed skull. \"You hurt or somethin'?\" The smashed in face of his brother remained silent. Cain brought up the rock and smashed it down again and again in Abel's face. \"Wake up!\" It was on the four hundred and fifty seventh falling of the arm and four hundred and fifty eighth raising of the arm that Cain figured something was wrong (aside from his arm growing increasingly tired). He dropped the rock. You have slain your brother, Cain. A voice came from the skies. \"No, his name is Abel.\" Cain replied, looking up. I'm calling you, Cain, by your name. \"But you said'your brother Cain'.\" I know that, I was just- ah forget it, the point is, you have committed a deadly sin. \"I don't get it.\" Your brother is dead. \"He's what now?\" You are insanely dense! Christ! The voice cursed. Yes, Father? A softer voice came from the skies. Not you, go back to your room. Anyway, Cain, you still down there? Cain scratched his head. \"I mean, I guess so.\" What, what does that- what does that even mean? \"I don't really get the'down there' thing. Like, uh, where are you?\" I reside in the Heavens, it's a place that all men go to when they die, which is where your brother, Abel, will go- \"I'm Cain.\" Cain interrupted. What? \"You said earlier that I see what you mean now. Just..... listen to me, alright? You see, I am the Creator of your species. I molded you after myself and- what, what is it you're doing there? Are you..... are you looking at a sun-dial? \"Well, you've been talking for a long time.\" I've been talking for a matter of seconds! Look, you did a bad thing. \"How should I know that? I don't even fully grasp what I did.\" Ah shit. What do you humans need? A list of rules? \"Uh,\" Cain scratched his head again, pulling his hand away at the feel of blood on his skull. \"Sure, I guess. Wouldn't hurt.\" Ah crap..... the voice grumbled and sounded as thought it was fading. I should have listened to my mother when she said the commitment.....",
        "Oh boy . Let 's pop open that can of worms as succinctly as I can . Warning : might be tainted by my opinion . Take it with a grain of salt . OJ Simpson was a famous football player in the 70s & an actor / celebrity in the 80s . In the 90s , he was in a high speed chase after allegedly killing his ex - wife & her friend Ronald Goldman . He was defended by Johnnie Cochran in his murder trial & eventually found not guilty of the OJ Simpson is black . To understand the trial , you need to understand 1 ) the 90s as the first real time Americans could watch a court proceeding on the news every night as if it was reality television , and 2 ) racial tension in America . In more detail : 1 ) Society straight up watched this trial for fun . That 's a fucked up thing to imagine , but I remember all the adults constantly talking about it when I was a kid in the 90s . Even now , there are high - profile trials that get a lot of news & people watch them like they 're entertainment . And this trial had everything : OJ was a football player , he was a handsome , wealthy celebrity . He might have killed his ex - lover ( and her possible new lover ) in the heat of the moment . After he killed her , there was a car chase that was televised live ( because California televises car chases for some reason ) that interrupted the 1994 NBA Championship ( if I 'm remembering right ) . And it was a very close call -- it was n't a cut and dry case . 2 ) Comedian Chris Rock had a joke , \" When OJ was acquitted , white people were a little too mad & black people were a little too happy . \" Los Angeles in 1994 was a very racially tense place . The [ Rodney King Riots ] ( URL_0 ) occurred in 1992 after the LA Police Department ( then considered some of the most racist cops in the country ) beat a young black man to death and were n't charged with anything . People were mad . OJ Simpson was a black man who had been long - since accepted by white America , * * except he just killed a white woman . * * The lawyer who defended OJ was Johnnie Cochran , a famous civil rights lawyer . It does n't make a lot of sense that a civil rights lawyer would defend an alleged murderer unless it was being spun into a racial crime . Johnnie Cochran was famous for his \" slick \" way with words ( I do n't mean any offense , I just do n't know how else to describe it ) . So some believed that OJ was guilty , but was defended by someone who could spin the trial around . So that was n't concise at all , but did it help any ?",
        "Climate change and the fight against Aids are leading the list of concerns for the first day of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos.Some 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe will listen to UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's opening speech on Wednesday. Mr Blair will focus on Africa's development plans and global warming. Earlier in the day came an update on efforts to have 3 million people on anti-Aids drugs by the end of 2005. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said 700,000 people in poor countries were on life-extending drugs - up from 440,000 six months earlier but amounting to only 12% of the 5.8 million who needed them. A $2bn \"funding gap\" still stood in the way of hitting the 2005 target, the WHO said.The themes to be stressed by Mr Blair - whose attendance was announced at the last minute - are those he wants to dominate the UK's chairmanship of the G8 group of industrialised states. Other issues to be discussed at the five-day conference range from China'seconomic power to Iraq's future after this Sunday's elections. Aside from Mr Blair, more than 20 other world leaders are expected to attend including French President Jacques Chirac - due to speak by video link after bad weather delayed his helicopter - and South African President Thabo Mbeki, whose arrival has been delayed by Ivory Coast peace talks. The Ukraine's new president, Viktor Yushchenko, will also be there - as will newly elected Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. Showbiz figures will also put in an appearance, from U2 frontman Bono - a well-known campaigner on trade and development issues - to Angelina Jolie, a goodwill campaigner for the UN on refugees.Unlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. At the same time, about 100,000 people are expected to converge on the Brazilian resort of Porto Alegre for the World Social Forum - the so-called \"anti-Davos\" for campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes.In contrast, the Davos forum is dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend. A survey published on the eve of the conference by PricewaterhouseCoopers said four in ten business leaders were \"very confident\" that their companies would see sales rise in 2005. Asian and American executives, however, were much more confident than their European counterparts. But the political discussions, focusing on Iran, Iraq and China, are likely to dominate media attention.",
        "Police were targeted with fireworks, while motorists described \"petrol bombs\" being thrown at cars on Commercial Road, Pill, on 20 October. Three teenagers - aged 16 to 17 - were sentenced to five months' custody at Cwmbran Youth Court on Tuesday. Two 13-year-olds were handed non-custodial 12-month referral orders. All five of the teenagers - who cannot be named - had earlier admitted violent disorder, with one of the 16-year-olds also admitting a separate charge of breaching a dispersal order. District Judge David Parsons said no other sentences could be justified because of the \"uninhibited, unlawful behaviour.\" Prosecutor Paul Hewitt told the court police received calls at 19:45 BST to say youths had set off fireworks. Officers arrived at the scene but a lit firework was thrown at them and, when about 20 youths began throwing stones and eggs, they retreated. \"At about 20:35, police were called to another riot on Commercial Road, where there were fires being set in bins and fireworks thrown at buildings,\" Mr Hewitt said. \"There was a large group in the street, throwing items at vehicles. The windscreen of a police van was smashed by a brick, causing significant damage.\" Mr Hewitt described wheelie bins being set alight and put into the road, \"petrol bombs\" being thrown at vehicles with \"terrified\" motorists making three-point turns to escape. He added: \"Local people were terrified. Police feared their vehicles would be pelted with fireworks and the entire area was under siege. \"A dispersal order was issued and a police helicopter was used to tell the crowd on loudspeaker.\" Locals and motorists described \"missiles and bombs\" being thrown at cars and thousands of pounds worth of damage caused. A video taken on a mobile phone was shown, with a youth heard shouting \"there are Molotov cocktails out here, throw it\" as cars were set alight. Judge Parsons handed each of the three older defendants - two were aged 16 and one 17 - a 10-month detention and training order, half of which will be served in custody with the rest under supervision in the community. He said the court had an \"overwhelming obligation\" to \"protect the public in their homes or businesses or in the street.\" \"Those that partake in disturbances of this magnitude, causing harm and fear to even the most steel-hearted of residents, must be punished accordingly,\" he added.",
        "Edinburgh. Stop a minute, just stop. Stop moaning about the buses, and how you have to wait in the rain, or how the trams aren't finished, or how the nights are getting shorter and Scotland is so cold. Do you know how lucky you are? I mean, seriously. Every year, without fail, you are guaranteed to have the world's largest arts and comedy festival. The population of the city will double in size, literally, to around a million. You will develop pavement rage. All your favourite locals will be rammed. For some, yes, the crowds and hustle and bustle are too much. But just STOP and realise how lucky you are. I don't know how the team who manage the Fringe do it. All of the Old Town turns into one giant epic venue with 100s of smaller venues. Pop-up bars (Udderbelly, Spiegel Gardens, Underbelly, The Gilded Balloon), 1000s of acts, 10s of 1000s of tickets, every bar opens till 3am, every club till 5am, cafes that normally shut at 5pm shut at 10pm. Stores run out of caffeine pills and berocca. The Council must go into over-drive with cleaning (I mean, this city was kept CLEAN during all the plastic cups and drunk folk eating hot dogs at 3am.) You have a giant festival on your door step! Travellers spend PS1000s on accomodation and travel to get here. You have a carnivale atmosphere all month round. No matter what time of day, or what day it is, that you leave - you always feel like you're leaving the party early. The atmosphere and sustained energy momentum is unmatched. I really don't know how the performers, the Festival folk, the flyerers, the biz owners, the Fringe staff...how they do it. But I love it. As Peter Y says, you could spend the whole month being entertained and still not be done. You could spend every last penny, or you could spend none as there are plenty free shows. Stop trying to live a normal 9 - 5 existence for one month. Accept that you'll get less sleep, spend more, drink more. But you'll make more friends, see more, experience more than you might in the whole year. Edinburgh, each year one of the biggest, longest parties in the world comes to YOU. Don't waste the opportunity. Go, enjoy, make your own stories. Enjoy.",
        "In the US currently, each state is responsible for administering elections for both itself and for federal offices (Congress and the President). Each state sets slightly different rules, and enforces those rules by different standards. Most states do it badly on several dimensions, and I think the Constitution should be amended to have the Feds do it. States disallow felons from voting in arbitrary and uneven ways. Personally, I think that even criminals should be allowed to vote, but the way we do it now is insane. Someone can be banned for life from voting in Kentucky, and perfectly allowed to vote if they move to Maine. This violates core equal protection principles. The same US citizen should not be barred from federal elections in one state and allowed in another. If we are going to have such a rule, equality under law requires that it be applied equally to all Americans. States routinely gerrymander electoral districts. Most states are badly gerrymandered, and state legislators seek to effectively disenfranchise people by drawing absurd congressional districts. Both parties do this brazenly. A uniform rule of drawing districts enforced nationally is the best way to fix this. It could be done on the state level, but it might require a constitutional amendment anyway. [The Supreme Court is in the process of deciding that now.] But this is a major hinderance of democracy, and should be fixed, even if a Constitutional amendment is necessary to do it. States routinely abuse voting systems to abridge voting rights. This gets into voter ID laws and a lot of stuff like that, but across the US, there are terrible histories (and often presents) of monkeying around with the electoral system for partisan gain. Uniform national rules would prevent this kind of gamesmanship. The amendment I'd propose would read basically as follows: The times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators, Representatives, and the President shall be prescribed by an independent agency of the United States. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Putting some text here so the bottom message works properly and doesn't bleed into my amendment text.

        "This movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art. What strikes first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed. Besides following the play like a TV broadcast, there is generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in the games. This brings forward the emotions and situations these men go through as they attempt to reach glory. Today's TV broadcasting style, so different than that of 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this movie.<br /><br />The players are not the only stars. The audience, the referees, the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history. In this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way. In that regard, today's TV broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer than before.<br /><br />There are several highlighted players: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague#o (Spain), Socrates (Brazil), and Sanchez (Mexico).<br /><br />This movie is not a collection of the best soccer moves of Mexico 1986, although most of them are well covered. Across all the movie, there is a stress for presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the cost of skipping relevant plays of the games themselves. This is what makes this movie so interesting and unique.<br /><br />Because of what happened because of referees during Mexico 1986, much of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely Maradona-biased. Much of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two linesmen, that they are as human as the players, and that all of the abovementioned make mistakes one way or the other. Soccer rules do not allow referees to use TV based replays to make decisions, so for the most part referees have to decide on what they perceive. As a consequence, referees play an active part in the development of a game. Their influence can be seen in several parts of this movie.<br /><br />The sequel movie for the 1990 World Cup, compared to this one, is just a source of bitter disappointment. Much of it comes from the fact that it became too involved in the game, whereas this movie tells things from a more distant, unbiased point of view.",
        "The country's government has deemed him worthy of the Grand Cross of the Order of Civil Merit for his bravery. Echeverria reportedly tried to fight off the terrorists with his skateboard to save a stabbed woman. He became one of eight victims of the assault on the London Bridge area. Earlier in the week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy praised his \"heroic and exemplary act\" and recommended that he receive the award. The foreign ministry in Madrid said: \"His bravery in standing up for a defenceless person is a reminder of the need to remain united in the face of the scourge of terrorism.\" On Saturday night, Echeverria, 39, was passing through Borough Market after an evening skateboarding with friends nearby. Guillermo Sanchez, a friend who was with him at the time, told El Pais newspaper that they had been on their way to dinner when they saw a man on the street and assumed they had stumbled into a drunken brawl. They then saw a police officer fall to the ground and a woman being assaulted. \"I'm focusing on her and then, suddenly, I see that Ignacio's there, starting to hit [the attackers] with his skateboard,\" Sanchez told the paper. Shortly afterwards, Echeverria was attacked himself and he was last seen lying on the ground, the family said. His friends managed to get away. His death was confirmed on Wednesday after his family had waited several days for information. On Thursday, Las Rozas, his hometown on the outskirts of Madrid, held a vigil in his honour, which was attended by thousands. El Pais reported that a new skateboarding park will be named after him. \"My brother Ignacio tried to stop the terrorists and lost his life trying to save others,\" his sister Isabel said on social media. Echevarria worked for the HSBC bank in London, as part of their team fighting money laundering. His body is due to arrive in Madrid on Saturday, said Spanish news agency EFE. The same Spanish state aircraft will also carry some of Echevarria's relatives. The British ambassador to Spain, Simon Manley, and Spain's Deputy Foreign Minister, Cristobal Gonzalez-Aller, will meet the plane when it arrives. The three attackers were killed by police shortly after they began their assault. In that time, they had driven a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and then proceeded to neighbouring Borough Market, where they got out and began attacking people with large knives. Eight people died in the attack and 48 people were injured.",
        "One example of this case is the issue about facebook data mining and using the information that users put into their facebook accounts for facebook's personal gain. People generally have a negative reaction to this and there is now generally a form of hatred against the company. I find this a really odd reaction because I thought that it was clear to both parties that that's what your getting into when you use facebook. I usually think that when you're accessing the internet in some form, especially when it requires creating accounts, you're already opening your own information for the company's use or even for the general public's use. So, it seems that many people didn't expect facebook would use or \"exploit\" its users' information for their own profit. And this type of relationship between facebook and the oblivious facebook user becomes a relationship of exploitation. About this type of exploitation relationship, I think it's better to stop people from being exploited by simply informing people about facebook and what they're getting into when they're creating an account. Either that or blame the law and acting upon that blame by passing a law that stops companies such as Facebook from exploiting user information. It seems to me that blaming facebook or the exploiter is a regressive way of thinking in that it leads to no action. Blaming the ignorance of the exploited on the other hand helps to improve the thinking of the victims so that they would not be exploited again in the future. It's like in a bully situation, instead of blaming the bully, you blame the victim. The victim has to stand up for hirself so he would be able to face any future bullies. There is the counter argument that in today's society, facebook has turned into a form of necessity for many people and thus they can't simply avoid giving their own information. I think that this varies in degrees. For example, one can create a facebook account and only add their names and no other information in the account. With them having the idea of giving away their information to facebook, they would be more conscientious about giving away their information. Hello, users of CMV!

        "Hillingdon Council's leader said it would provide funding to challenge it for \"however long it takes to win this battle.\" Wandsworth, Richmond and Hillingdon councils spent PS300,000 from their general funds on legal action. Windsor and Maidenhead Council spent PS50,000 from its development fund. The details were obtained using Freedom of Information laws. Council general funds are where money for most council services is drawn, with funds raised from council tax and central government grants. The four councils failed in an attempt to challenge the decision to build the runway at the High Court in January. London Councils, the body that represents London local authorities, says that by 2020 there will be a budget gap of around PS2bn in London local government, which council budgets will have to accommodate. Hillingdon Council has set aside a contingency budget of PS200,000 for possible future legal action against the third runway, while Wandsworth has budgeted PS25,000. The case against the runway brought by the councils was struck out by Mr Justice Cranston in January on the basis that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the claim, but further legal action against the runway may take place. John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, questioned whether the councils were making the right spending decisions. \"Those are huge sums of taxpayers' money spent on legal fees which could have otherwise gone towards road maintenance or adult social care,\" he said. \"Given that Hillingdon residents have seen their council tax rise by over 45 in real terms over the last 20 years, the decision to allocate so much money for further action raises serious questions over the council's priorities. \"Many residents may well oppose the third runway, but they are free to form groups to launch legal action themselves.\" Stan Woods, a resident of Longford, which will be demolished to make room for the third runway, feels there is little the councils can do to affect the outcome. \"I worked at Heathrow for 38 years, so can see the reason for expansion, but equally wish I could keep my home,\" he said. \"I guess the councils feel they are acting on behalf of their communities, but to be honest this decision will be taken higher up the political ladder.\" Councillor Raymond Puddifoot, leader of Hillingdon Council, said it was time the government stopped \"wasting time and money\" and turned its attention to finding a \"workable alternative\" to Heathrow. \"The government spent more than PS3.8 million of taxpayers' money on the expansion of Heathrow Airport in the 18 months between July 2015 and December 2016, and this figure has risen dramatically over the last few months and will continue to do so,\" he said. \"We will continue provide both the funding and the integrity necessary to both defend and represent our residents for however long it takes to win this battle.\"",
        "For the first time in the last few hours there was finally silence. No short sharp intakes of air or pained groans. The organised chaos of the maternity ward melted away and a sense of unearthly calm fell over me. I stared at my beautiful newborn son and realised I'd never loved anything so much in my life. My reverie was interrupted by a small trophy icon appearing in the bottom right of my vision followed by the text \"Achievement Unlocked: A Brush with Death.\" It was if the temperature in the room had dropped. I realised my life would be ended by this bundle of warmth. He was so innocent and unspoilt by the world but the achievements were never wrong. Taking Samuel back from the hospital my wife slept and child slept soundly. My mind was adrift in a tumultuous sea. Would mines be a violent end? An accident? Was I to be the father of a cruel and vicious child? I realised that if I were to cast my son aside or disappear it would undoubtedly lead to my own demise. It suddenly became clear it was inevitable and I was determined would let his life be ruined by my death. His sudden cries punctuated my epiphany and I instinctually turned to him. The lights of the oncoming articulated lorry highlighted him as a drifted into the wrong side of the road. Tires screamed as I wrestled the wheel. Jane awoke in sudden fear as we barely returned to the correct lane. It dawned on me had that maybe that been my planned end? Had I cheated fate? Samuel had been a normal boy with a normal life. Of course be got into trouble and we'd had our arguments but I'd never feared for my life. Now there was a grandchild on the way and the memory of the achievement was all but gone. It was a few days later that the hospital called and explained \"there had been a mistake.\" Doctor: \"He's alive physically but he's gone, the machines are all that are keeping his heart beating. I'll give you some time with him.\" Jane: \"But he's had the all clear. It isn't fair he' not old and he has a grandson. I can't bear to see him like this.\" Samuel: \"I know it's wrong Mum but we can't leave him like this. This isn't living and you know he wouldn't have wanted this.\" Jane: \"I..... I can't...\" Samuel felt a burning sensation in his throat as the memories of a happy childhood assaulted his tear ducts. He realised he would have to be the man he had been raised to be. He would have to make the decision to turn off his Father's life support.",
        "Middlesbrough mayor Ray Mallon has been drafted in to boost the Yes campaign as the North East assembly referendum enters its final week.The former police chief, dubbed Robocop for his zero tolerance style, clashed on Thursday with Sunderland No campaigner Neil Herron. Mr Mallon said an assembly would give local people more of a say over key issues such as transport and crime. But Mr Herron said North East people did not want or need an assembly.The pair met on the platform at Sunderland station as Mr Mallon toured the region highlighting claimed improvements to transport if the area gets an assembly. But Mr Herron - who gained fame as one of Sunderland's \"metric martyrs\" and is running his own No campaign alongside the official North East Says No campaign - said he was not convinced by Mr Mallon's arguments. \"The reality is that it is not going to deliver,\" he said. \"Labour has had two-and-a-half years to convince people of this. If you can't sell a deal in that time, it is a bad deal.\" On Wednesday, Mr Mallon provoked fury by branding the official No Campaign \"two-bit Tories\" in a confrontation outside its Durham headquarters. \"The campaign is being run by two-bit Conservatives who are not interested in what happens in the North East; they are interested in hitting the Labour party over the head,\" he said. Mr Mallon is a late recruit to the Yes campaign after rejecting overtures from No campaigners including, he claims, Tory leader Michael Howard.Most local observers believe the contest is too close to call, although little recent polling has been carried out. Yes campaign chairman John Tomaney said he hoped for a late flurry of votes to boost turnout - something he says will boost their cause. He added: \"The government exerts a lot of political power in the North East. The accountability should be in the North East as well.\" He also defended the decision to attack the official No campaign's alleged political allegiances. \"We felt we had to show what people were behind the No campaign - London Tory spin doctors.\" Graham Robb, spokesman for North East Says No, said the Yes campaign's decision to get personal dragged the campaign \"into the gutter\" and showed they were \"rattled\". And he hit back at Mr Mallon's claim that an assembly would improve transport links in the region. \"It can push paper around but it can not get people moving,\" he said. Some 487,939 people had returned their ballot papers by Wednesday - a turnout of 25.7%. The deadline for voting is next Thursday, 4 November.",
        "Jack Beales, 93, of Rhyl, carried out the attacks while she was a young girl, mainly when he was in his 70s. He denied five charges of rape and six other sexual offences but was unanimously convicted by the jury at Mold Crown Court on 9 December. Sentencing him on Wednesday, Judge Rhys Rowlands said Beales had destroyed his victim's childhood. His victim, now aged in her 30s, took to the witness stand to read her victim impact statement. The court heard the abuse began when she was aged six and continued for about 10 years. She said she had wanted to commit suicide and hoped, when she confronted Beales last summer, it would bring some kind of closure. But she said it had not and she was still on strong medication for depression and anxiety, and was awaiting counselling. The court had heard she confronted Beales at his home and he admitted in front of her mother and his wife he had groped her as a child. He later said \"that was what men did.\" The woman said every time she came into contact with Beales he made hurtful comments. She said: \"Once again I felt suicidal and felt I could not continue suffering while he was living a happy and carefree life, with no apparent suffering.\" The woman said one of her biggest wishes in life was to start a family. But she added: \"I worry that there may be internal physical damage due to the abuse which may mean I am unable to conceive or carry a child to full term.\" She said she felt she could not trust anyone and saw the world \"as a very dangerous place.\" \"I am hyper vigilant when kids are left unattended or unsupervised around men,\" she told the court. \"I feel unable to relax, and as though I have a responsibility to be watchful over others.\" Defending barrister Andrew Green said Beales had no previous convictions and accepted some acts had taken place but he denied other allegations including all the rapes. Jailing him, Judge Rowlands said Beales did not have \"an ounce of remorse\" and was \"devoid of any moral compass at all.\" He will have to serve a further 12 months on licence. Det Insp William Jones, of North Wales Police, said: \"John (Jack) Beales was a manipulative and depraved sexual predator who committed multiple offences over a sustained period of time. He is now thankfully behind bars. \"No child should ever have to experience what the victim went through.\" An NSPCC Wales spokesman said the victim \"must be commended for showing incredible bravery in reporting what happened to her so Beales could eventually face justice for his crimes.\"",
        "I almost choke on the stale cigar stink of the rundown old pub. My view from the far side of the bar allows me to see over the raggedy pool tables where some drunken old patrons knock around the cue ball aimlessly. The clack of the billiard balls is the only sound that interrupts the outdated jukebox music, scratchily playing \"Sweet Home Chicago\" on repeat. I sip my whiskey to try and calm my nerves. Damn it all if I come off as shaky during this meeting, not that it matters either way. I pull out a cigarette and try lighting it, but my hands are buzzing like I'm trying to keep still a damn jackhammer. I hear the bells tied to the door handle jingle and I look up. It was him, dressed in a nice suit. Too nice for this place but that's his style. Surrounds himself in anguish while he appears as royalty. He strides smoothly over to the table and seats himself. \"I ordered you a drink. Bloody Mary, virgin.\" I said. \"Very funny.\" He clutches the glass and the red thick liquid turns black and he downs the whole thing and wipes a bit from his snide lips. \"So, lets get this over with.\" I said solemnly. \"Hm hm, do try and cheer up. I'm not here to take anything from you, I'm here to inform you I've already taken it.\" \"What are you talking about? I'm still breathing, aren't I?\" \"How naive. Why would I go through the trouble of granting you such prosperity just to snatch the breath from you.\" \"The agreement called for me to sacrifice my life, I didn't realize that was up to interpretation.\" I clutched my glass in anger. \"There is no misinterpretation, I'm sure you'll find. She asked me to give this to you as she'll no longer need it.\" He reached into his coat and shuffled around for something. My heart was pounding, I had nothing to expect but the worst, especially from Him. Slowly he pulled out the shimmering circle with the small diamond setting and placed in on the table in front of me. I stared in disbelief, \"No, you can't. That's not fair! You weren't supposed to involve anyone else. You were supposed to take MY life! MY soul!\" \"I believe I just have. And'fair' isn't exactly a part of my repertoire.\" I'd go on cursing him, but it would be redundant. I lay my hand atop of the ring and go blank. \"I believe my business is done here. Enjoy the rest of your prosperous days, Mr. Daniels.\" He said with a sarcastic tone as he stood up and buttoned his coat. I watched him leave and take with him the only thing I had ever actually earned. He was right - he had taken my life, my soul.",
        "I live a pretty interesting life. When I was 23 I sold a company that I created for 237 million dollars. I took my money and rode off into the sunset to travel the world and do all the things that I had ever imagined myself doing. I have been to all 7 Wonders of the World. I have skied in the Swiss Alps and I have shared wine with Monks in the Pagoda Forest. I have given sizable, anonymous, donations to charities all over the world. I have even volunteered for Doctors Without Borders in Africa. By any definition, I am a good person. I just returned from a trip in the Andes Mountains where I had been doing some backpacking. After trekking nearly a hundred miles, all I wanted to do was get back to my condo and sleep for as long as I could lay in bed. After my plane lands, I hop in an Uber, run by my guilty pleasure (Taco Bell) and then head for home. Home is a condo in the San Remo building near Central Park. As I walk in, I drop all of my bags in the foyer and head into my room for a quick shower, and bed. Right as I close my eye lids and start to drift off, I hear my mother. \"Daniel!\" She screams. \"Daniel! OH MY GOD, DANIEL!\" She continues to yell as she bursts into tears. I hear my my fathers voice next. What is going on? Why are they in my apartment? \"Jesus Christ, not again. Call 911!\" He shouts. You can hear the fear as well as the disappointment in his voice. A few minutes later, I open my eyes. \"Daniel. Daniel, can you hear me?\" says a voice. \"ugh, yeah.\" I mutter. \"What the hell is going on?\" \"Is he going to be okay?\" I hear my mother say. \"Yes, ma'am. He is stable now. We are going to keep him over night to monitor his vitals, though.\" As I start to slowly gain my wits about me, I ask \"Guys, what is going on? Where are we?\" \"Where do you think we are, Daniel?\" My father snaps. \"We're in the hospital. Again.\" I am a 23 year old heroin addict who has just overdosed for the third time in the last 8 months. Turns out, I'm not really the good person that I thought I was.",
        "This was such a terrible idea My teeth chattered as shells fired from the German artillery spewed columns of dirt far into the sky. The Germans always fired artillery before a big assault, and judging by the increased rate of fire and lack of rifle fire this was going to be a big one. But what the hell do I know? I'm just Squad Leader Gueguen, meritoriously promoted after a german Kriegsmarsch tore our last Squad Leader's legs from his torso and showered me in his guts. It was just coincidence that I managed to pull the pins on my whole grenade belt and trip in time for the belt to come off and the diesel monstrosity to step over it as it exploded. The shelling stopped and then I looked up and reconfirmed by earlier statement. \"GET IN THE BUNKER\" was all I heard as the dirigibles dropped their lethal payload. We scrambled to put our rebreathers on and make a rush for the bunkers, but the multi-tasking seemed to be too much for some of the younger members of my squad as they writhed and clawed at their eyeballs. Then, the distinctive sound of a Gewehr Wagen as it peppered the men who were too slow with brass. I took a shot to my calf and stumbled into the muck. My rifle out of my hands I grasped for my revolver and flipped onto my back only to be greeted by the encroaching german line. They had broken through. I shot at a man carrying a tank of liquid fire, it took to many rounds to puncture the metal tank on his back and envelop his squad in an inferno. And then I saw it, a Kriegsmarsch heading straight for me. A smoke bellowing monstrosity with a large wolf scrawled crudely against it's bullet dented chassis. I had a feeling this would not end like last time. I fired the rounds left in my revolver and drew my knife struggling to stand As if I have a chance against this thing, this war was such a terrible idea An explosion threw me off my recently stabilized knees and the Kriegsmarsch in front of me exploded in a shower of metal and human bits. The thunder of a land fortress sounded behind me and a surge of French soldiers outfitted with metal plating and backed by our own diesel mechs came foward. This was still such a terrible idea My wound's pain growing faint I thought of home and the life I left behind. My wife, my son, my farm. And then I felt sorry for the future squad leader because he would soon realize that his promotion was another in a string of terrible ideas.",
        "I know there have been similar topics in CMV before, even one that is closely related to this but no one has really stated it in this way. Recently I watched Anita Sarkeesian's 'Women as Background Decoration' video as part of her ongoing Tropes Vs Women series. If you aren't familiar with her channel and what she does, I'll just link it [here] as opposed to explaining it. But to summarize the video (Part 1 anyway) she goes into a thorough investigation of women as so called 'background decoration', typically NPC's such as prostitutes who are often highly sexualized and objectified, whether it be through hypersexualisation, commodification or violence. The examination she did of this 'trope' was trying to underline how women are used through advertising and gameplay as just 'background' features who's only purpose is to service the [largely] male protagonists sexually. Now while I like Anita overall and think she puts a great deal of thought, effort and production into her videos, I kept thinking that the entire premise of the video (and infact, the Tropes vs Women series) hinges solely on whether or not it is the responsibility of video games not to display females in these kinds of ways. Since video games are a completely fictional game-based experience, to me they hold no more responsibility for upholding standards of gender representation or equality than any other work of fiction, such as film or books. It's their job to include whatever they feel advances the story, or adds to the entertainent experience overall, and it is up to the userplayer to use discretion when possibly applying these tropes to people and interactions they experience in every day life. Some arguments I expect might come up: - But what if kidsteens play this and think it's the appropriate way to treat womenpeople in general? Video games have ratings for a reason, the games I (and Anita in the video) were referencing were often rated MA 15 or R. Sure ratings aren't flawlessly enforced and kids could end up playing them, but that's the fault of distributors and other retailers for not applying appropriate ID checks. - But even adults playing for extended amounts could unknowingly or sub-consciously take on these objectifying and misogynistic values. Again, I don't see this as a fault of the developers and creators. As I mentioned previously, I don't believe they are under any obligation to represent race, gender, sexuality and violence in ways that are morally or ethically just. The fault lies in an adult (or older teenager) for taking it as anything more than a work of fiction at face value. Love to hear comments and discussion, please CMV!",
        "Im a fan of the MGM Grand. They always have promotions going on for their rooms. Check out the vegas forums on fatwallet.com or just to the mgms website and take advantage of them. I got a double bed room, for 3 nights at a total of 390.00. Everyone here is relaxed, friendly and this place is HUGE. It has everything you will need. Has some amazing restaurants, fun gambling and casual atmosphere. Its not in your face or intiimdating. Its not stuck up like some others down the strip. MGM is a good value and comfortable. Wouldnt really go here for luxury per say, but the new Skylofts and the West Wing sound luxurious. Havent stayed in those yet. Their pool complex is so big. They have 5 pools, a lazy river and new cool pool area. Like an outdoor club, but a heads up YOU HAVE TO PAY COVER:) Good- THEIR BEDS!!!!!!!!! I wish I could take them home with me. So comfortable. Like Heaven. Conceirge- Awesome people. I had them put balloons, a Happy Birthday banner and a flower in the room before we got there, and it was such a great surprise. They did it just right! Airport Checkin- WONDERFUL. This is the only hotel who has this at the Vegas airport. I checked in here so the conceirge could have a heads up that we were coming and have time to set everything up. The lovely man who helped me in the airport check in was so accomadating. At first I was hesitant to check in here because I thought I couldnt get the room I wanted, or you know...haggle like most people do at check in to get the perfect room they want. THIS WAS EASIER. I got my Non-Smoking room, close to the elevator (actually the first one in the hall. If you have seen the LONG hallways at the MGM you know what Im talking about), high floor but a possible view. HE GAVE ME all that I wanted. This was a room that was blocked in his system, but had the manager unblock it so he can give it to me. AWESOME. Will always check in for MGM this way. RIDE TO HOTEL- MGM is the first hotel when you exit the airport. Fare is like 15 (up to 5 ppl in a taxi). DOnt take the MGM shuttle which charges 15 per person, roundtrip. Taxi is cheaper. We won some money, swam a lot, and relaxed. So much fun.",
        "Moral is a word that gets thrown around a lot, yet I believe it is actually an empty concept. There is no such thing as 'moral', as there is no right and wrong, and what we think is 'moral' is actually just a social contract. Here is one classic example: murder. It is punishable by death in many places, because taking another person's life is believed to be wrong and immoral. But then, isn't the death sentence just another murder? Why is it not wrong? If it's because the murder 'corrects' another murder, then would I be justified in taking revenge on someone who murders my beloved? And let's forget about petty homicides; let's talk about war - murder in the toll of millions. Humankind wants to punish a murderer by death, yet continues to wage wars like there is no moral repercussion for it. Another example: many people believe that inequality is 'wrong', and some people should not have as much money as they do. But who decides so, and who can determine how much money one should have? If I work hard and work smart enough to earn my money, why can't I have it? If I have enough cunning and manipulation to hoard resource for myself, who's to say that I can't? Murder and inequality are naturally occurring phenomenons. Some people argue that just because it's natural doesn't mean it's moral and justifiable. The exact same argument has been used against homosexuality for ages. Now, our argument is that 'because it's natural, it must be accepted.' As an LGBT person, I never feel that my sexuality is wrong or right, it just is. The fact that it's more accepted now is a reflection of society's economic and political progress rather than because it's 'right.' I think that what we call 'moral' is a huge misnomer; 'moral' is just a social contract we agree upon for the sake of ourselves and our society, rather than intrinsic right and wrong. CMV?

        "Pandemic sits by the fire wondering if the elements are going to show up. It's already a shitshow, might as well turn it into shitstorm. Stupid humans grew too fast, too soon, and now here we all are trying to fight over who gets to cull the herd. \"I've been the tool of population control for thousands of years!\" War yelled, \"Why are we arguing? I'd even concede to taking Pestilence along.\" \"Why not Pandemic, War? Scared she'll outshine you? \" , prodded Genocide, \"I never thought a big aggressive guy like you would be scared of a little sickness.\" War roars, \"Well Pestilence can project to Pandemic and I like him more.\" \"We can't keep fighting over this, or they will show up sooner or later.\" Pestilence finally speaks up. \"Yes, I can tap into and project Pandemic once War reaches a certain area coverage, but it may take too long to reach maximum effect for War and me.\" Pestilence was starting to ramble, \"Maybe if Pandemic and Genocide take half, and we take half..... Its just how much credit we're willing to give up. And,\" \"Stop. No, I want to lead this.\" War demanded. Genocide looks at Pandemic and whispers, \"if we don't just fucking start everyone's going to lose credit.\" Pandemic just shrugs her shoulders. She keeps watching the building, one of four they've been watching for years, trying to find some sign that would tell them how much time they have. War and Pestilence are having their own quiet conversation. Genocide takes the shrug as confirmation to continue. \"We need to just split up and spread. The new ones are coming soon and we can stop them! We can set this fucking them back thousands of years. We can put off total annihilation of humans for thousands of years!\" \"C'mon Gen, you really want to continue the human race after all the shit that they've caused? The shit they're about to cause?\" Pandemic asked, looking to at the building a hundred yards away, thinking of the other three spread around the world. Genocide looked at her with sad eyes, \"I just want to continue existing, Pan.\" \"Damn dude.\" \"Yea, and if we can stop them from existing another thousand years, then we get to exist for that thousand years.\" Pandemic wanted to save Gen of the heartache of nonexistence but all Pandemic wanted was to let loose and drift into nonexistence. Pan guesses she can work with War and Pestilence to stop Zombie, Robot, Nuclear, and Genetically Modified from taking over and completely destroying the Earth. Guess it's time to cull the herd.

        "A little background. I am a 21 year old female. I spent the first 20 years of my life dedicating my life to being a good Christian, a disciple of Christ. I even enrolled at a very conservative private Christian college. I still attend there now. My undergraduate experience is what turned it all around for me. I spent three years meeting people who -truly- lived their lives according to scripture. While I admire them for their dedication, I developed a strong aversion to Christian doctrine. I went on two mission tripsthose are what finalized it for me. I hated going to another culture with the intention of changing people. I loved their way of life, their culture, their religionI wanted to learn and grow from it, not try to \"improve\" it. I have come across a few milestones that I simply can't stomach anymore, and they have separated me from my previous beliefs: 1. The Christian God is the ONLY God. All other religions contain only idols. (I believe other religions to be beautiful and worthy of just as much praise. Most of these religions are built on similar conceptsI find them to be equal, all are attempts at creating meaning and discovering purpose) 2. Those who don't believe in the Christian God burn in eternal hellfire. 3. Homosexuality is sinful. 4. Sex with your partner before marriage is sinful. I spent a long time telling myself that the bible didn't -really- speak out against any of those things. I told myself that scripture interpretation was unclear. I finally realized that I was just changing scripture to what I wanted it to say, and that wasn't right. I believe that Christians look down on those of other religions and lifestyles with the basic idea that they know the absolute truth. I know they don't mean to condescendthey are trying to help others. However, I feel that this doctrine does more harm than good, as it fills people with fearfear of different religions and lifestyles that deserve respect. It destroys the modern world's chance at coexisting. I understand that other world religions have similar issues. However, I want to discuss Christianity because it is closest to home for me. I am looking for answers. Please CMV. EDIT: A lot of people are pointing out 2 things: scripture is open to interpretation, and many church sects present different doctrines. Please know that I am aware of both of these things. However, I have found thatin order to be comfortable with ChristianityI have to outright ignore very clear meanings in certain passages of scripture. I do not think this is right. I also have never found a church sect I am completely comfortable with.",
        "I should preface this with women in North America and Western Europe. To begin, I recognize that in certain situations, men have the leg up. Within organizations and politics there is typically an old boys club when it comes to leadership. If you are a women and you want to become a CEOs, high ranked political officials, etc., you are going to have a tougher time than a man. Indeed, both women and men see men as better leaders. However, there are a few problems with this. [One, is that it is changing] . There are more women becoming CEOs and high ranked politicians every year. And two, is that it affects such a small portion of people in that most men gunning for these jobs won't get them either. Three, I can't find the stat, but it would be very interesting to see whether the amount of men ceos men going for ceo positions is higher than for women. [Related to this is the issue of pay discrepancies, which are extremely biased and inaccurate] . Another leg up men have is in safety. It is nice as a man to not have to worry about being assaulted (however, I address this in point 4 below). However, in so many ways, women have it better than men. First, to combat the CEO status, [there are now more women than men in university and professional degrees like medicine and law] . I'd argue that if women want to complain about the glass ceiling, then they have to take this into account. Two, the judicial system is definitely better if you are a women. Not only is there the issue of custody, parental support, and the choice to bare children in benefit of women, [but women are less likely to be convicted of a crime or receive as harsh a sentence for the same crime] . Three, although there is normative pressures for women with respect to sexual freedom, they are typically only held back by their own attitudes, although I concede that these attitudes are imposed on them by society. [In other words, if women wanted to have lots of sex, they could. Men on the other hand could not] Four, to combat the point about sexual assault above, despite the outcry of violence against women, [men are actually more likely to experience violence against them] . Thus, men should be more afraid than women. Although, I do concede here that while these are averages, I imagine the average middle-class women is more likely to experience violence compared to the average middle-class man. In other words, the stats are probably biased by gang violence. I'm not saying either gender has it perfect. Ideally things would be changed for both groups. I'm just arguing that if you are going to focus on one group - men are currently the group that need the biggest change right now. CMV",
        "Five Give Up the Booze, Five Go Gluten Free, Five Go On A Strategy Away Day and Five Go Parenting will catch up with the sleuthing children as adults. The series, written by Bruno Vincent, follows on from the success of the recent Ladybird book spoofs for adults. The original 21 books featured Julian, George, Dick, Anne and their dog Timmy. Their escapades, set during the'40s and'50s, saw the children having virtually adult-free outdoor holidays where they solved mysteries while drinking lashings of ginger beer. Famous titles include Five on a Treasure Island and Five Go to Smuggler's Top. A film parody, Five Go Mad in Dorset, was also made by the Comic Strip team for Channel 4 and featured Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French and Adrian Edmondson. They went on to make another film called Five Go Mad on Mescalin. The books have also been made into films, TV series and cartoons, as well as audiobooks, comics and video games. Publisher Quercus said the five's grown-up adventures will \"remind older readers of the unbreakable bond\" between the children and \"introduce newer readers to the spiffing time you can have with a few friends and a dog.\" It added the series brings characters - who are \"posher than us and holidayed more than us\" into our \"baffling adult world.\" Their adult adventures will involve trying to give up alcohol, finding themselves on a puzzling \"strategy away day,\" hunting for a good gluten-free cream tea and, \"most perilous of all,\" preparing for parenthood. Anne McNeil of Enid Blyton Entertainment added they were \"thrilled\" with the new books, adding: \"We are certain Enid Blyton would have delighted in the gentle parody of her characters - characters which have helped to create a multi-million-selling global brand.\" The books will be released in hardback on 3 November. The Famous Five series is among some of Blyton's most famous books, which also include Noddy and The Faraway Tree. In all, she produced more than 700 books, writing one a week at the peak of her powers. The British writer, who was born in 1897 and died in 1968, has sold more than 600 million books in total, which have been translated into 90 languages. In 2008, a survey by the Costa Book Awards saw Blyton voted the \"most-loved author,\" beating Roald Dahl, JK Rowling and Jane Austen. Michael Joseph's Ladybird Books for Grown-Ups series, which includes the Mid-Life Crisis and The Hipster, has sold 1.74 million copies grossing PS10m to date, according to The Bookseller.",

The UK is recognised for having the best wind resource in Europe. \"One of the main messages from this report is that in a scenario with a higher content of wind energy, you are less reliant on fossil fuels,\" explained co-author Sophie Billington, a researcher from Cambridge Econometrics. \"This is a key message, particularly when you consider that the UK - for the past five years or so - has imported more gas than it has produced domestically.\" She told BBC News that under a high gas scenario (gas power plants replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants) and a 40 increase in gas prices by 30, electricity prices would increase by 8. However, under a high wind scenario (wind farms replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants), electricity prices would still rise but by only 4. \"For the wind scenario, you have higher upfront capital costs but fewer uncertain variable costs, leading to more price resilience,\" Ms Billington added. The report said that the UK electricity sector had undergone a substantial change in recent decades, shifting from a coal-based system to a more balanced mix \"encompassing nuclear and gas-fired power stations, as well as emerging renewable energy technologies.\" It observed: \"Over the next 10 to 20 years, the energy sector will need to be re-shaped again if the UK's targets to reduce CO2 emissions are to be met.\" In 2008, the UK established the world's first legally binding climate change target, requiring governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 from 1990 levels by 2050. Rob Norris, RenewableUK's head of communications, said that currently there were \"not enough renewables in the system to meet those targets.\" He told BBC News: \"The crucial thing is that energy policy is a long-term game and at the moment we only really know what the government support will be out to 2020. \"What you really need is a long-term vision out to 2030 so then you can plan, especially when it comes to things like large offshore developments.\" Mr Norris said he advocated a \"rich energy mix so then you do not put all your eggs in one basket.\" He added: \"If you have different technologies, including renewables, competing against each other then the cost is driven down for the consumer.\"",
        "Police are investigating a British National Party leaflet posted to homes in south Wales opposing plans for a new mosque.Anti-racism campaigners in Swansea have handed copies to South Wales Police. Swansea's Muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former St Andrews United Reform Church. The building on George Street has been derelict since the 1980s.Taha Idris, director of the Swansea Bay Race Equality Council, said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public. \"I'm quite shocked to see this sort of leaflet by the BNP in Swansea,\" he said.\"The BNP has tried in the past to get into Swansea and this is another example of them trying again. \"I am in no doubt that the BNP are not needed and not wanted here.\" A South Wales Police spokeswoman confirmed that they were looking at the contents of the leaflet. According to the BNP's website, they have been posted to homes in the Castle ward. The BNP website carries a photograph of party leader Nick Griffin - who lives near Welshpool, mid Wales - delivering the leaflet. The BNP has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion, but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest. Swansea Unite Against Fascism (UAF) is meeting this week to plan a campaign. Following the death earlier this year of Kalan Kawa Karim, an Iraqi Kurd living in Swansea, it organised an anti-racism march in the city that was supported by more than 1,000 people. It is planning its own mail shot campaign and may launch a petition in support of the plans for the mosque.Andy Richards, of Swansea UAF, said the leaflet was exactly what he had come to expect from the BNP.\"The people of Swansea will not put up with this.\" Swansea's Muslim community bought the former church, just across the road from the existing mosque on St Helen's Road, in the late 1990s. Mr Idris said the community was now raising money to renovate the building. \"It is a landmark building in Swansea and would otherwise just crumble,\" he said. \"It is the ideal opportunity for the building to be restored and used in the proper manner. \"It will be a Muslim community centre. It's a holistic place used for education, weddings, deaths and births.\" He said space was limited in the current mosque and on some occasions Muslims had to travel to Llanelli for cultural events.",

        "(view has been changed, instead of solving all problems i think it would allow solutions that we know work to be implemented and where isn't a complete solution it would lead to better use of resources and more suffering would be alleviated) While this is my view I intentionally made the title as hyperbolic as i could to generate more discussion. So the argument basically splits into three parts. First that all of our problems are caused by greed or anger or fear or other such negative emotions. The second part is that meditation helps people overcome these emotions. The third part is that happy, unbiased people will out compete other groups and natural selection will kill off greed and fear and such. What do most if not all problems have in common? They were caused by people making bad decisions. Someone trying to make more money creates monopolies and lobbies politicians. Countries scared of being outgunned start arms races. People obsessed with status or instant gratification consume to much. I will concede some problems aren't man made (volcanoes) but I will say the vast majority. Why do I think meditation will solve these problems. Lots of you will be wanting proof. A nice accessible Ted talk by a biochemist turned buddhist monk can be found [here]. At 16:40 he starts to talk about a paper submitted to nature showing monks who meditate are 4 standard deviations away from the bell curve of normal people on a scale showing how happy and compassionate people are. For more info on the research look at rmeditationpapers For those of you not wanting to readwatch all that. Meditation is like an exercise for your brain making you more aware of your thought processes and what is really going on in your mind. Redditors will most likely be aware of all the biases and flaws the brain has and by getting to know them and understand them by focusing on them in meditation you can overcome them. You realise that you are not really hungry your just bored, you realise you don't really want that flashy new car you just want people to think your a big shot and then you realise you don't really need strangers to approve of you because you know how much your friends and family love you. I know i'm simplifying a lot but i hope you get the idea. So how does this help mankind. Well the third part is that everything works so much better without these biases and errors of judgement. If person starts meditating they will do better at work and get promoted so they have more influence. People will notice you being happier and have more worthwhile relationships and start meditating too. Slowly but surely people ruled by fear and greed will be outperformed and replaced. I would also mention at this point that I am atheist because that will probably come up. A lot of my goals and ideas are based on this belief and i want make sure i'm not making a big mistake so reddit try and CMV",
        "Waiting in his office I had never been so nervous. I had the opportunity to shape the future if this universe not for the betterment of our society or theirs but because it is what was asked of me. \" Your 10:30 appointment is waiting in your office. \" The assistant's muffled voice of came through the door. \" Good morning, Dean. Thank you for making time for this meeting. \" I said rising to greet the art school dean. \" Good morning. I'm sorry I don't have much time today. I understand you have come to ask for a favor for your nephew. \" The white haired man addressed me passively as he motioned for me to sit across the desk from him. \" Yes sir, I won't mince words. I would like you reconsider my nephew's application for your art program. He has worked hard to improve since his previous application. \" The dean's demeanor changed from friendly as he looked over the top of his glasses at me his mouth tightened before he began speaking. \" I do not doubt the amount of effort your nephew has exhibited to become an artist. Despite this hard work you speak of he is still missing his certificate and we can not accept someone without the proper paperwork. \" \" Please sir, this decision has a wider impact, I know you think I am only asking this favor selfishly for my nephew... \" I moved to the edge of my seat leaning forward in hopes of adding the weight of my body to my words to make him understand. \" I fear that he will just end up in service, but if he were in school... \" I was stopped short as he rose from his seat, placing his hands on his desk and spat his next words in my direction. \" I don't care if this decision impacts the entire world. We have a reputation to uphold here in Vienna and we can not maintain out prestige by letting the unqualified in. \" He couldn't possible know that the world would get tied up in all of this no one in this universe could have that foresight. The questions came to mind quickly. Who had gotten here before me? How much did they reveal? Could they be waiting for me? The answer that came to me was to get out and regroup. \" I'm sorry you feel that way, I won't take up any more of your time. \" I stood up and extended my hand to the dean. He made no move to match the courtesy before I spun on my heals and walked from the office.

        "Let's just start off by saying that I will not return to this location. This is a chain that has a surprisingly loyal following, but I will not be part of that multitude and here is why. The interior has no sound abatement, so one cannot hear or understand the waitress. This morning it was only a third full and I cannot possibly imagine what a roar it would be if it were full of patrons. I ordered eggs over medium, sausage and potato, along with plain English muffin and juice. My son ordered scrambled eggs, potato and corned beef hash. Upon pretty fast service we were confronted with my fried eggs well-done hard, potato so dry that they sucked all the moisture from your mouth and were flavorless to boot. Not a lick of salt, onion, oil, parsley or anything other than those miserable potato rectangles. Sausages were good, flavorful and not greasy. The plain English muffin came with the oil that they try to pretend is butter. I handed the muffin to the waitress and reminded her that I wanted plain. She promptly informed me that they had two types of muffin, plain and whole wheat and I ordered plain. This is when my son and I exchanged glances and knew, really knew that this was not our day to buy lottery tickets. It is like ordering regular coffee in Mass and getting cream and sugar in it. So be careful in your vocabulary or your expectations will be shattered. Seek clarity from you waitress, if you can hear her and if she can her you. My son's corned beef was straight out of the can, it just had been heated and broken apart from the can shape before serving. We both left disappointed. When the cashier asked how was everything she was simply going through the formula motions because she did not miss a beat in making change along with my silence. It seemed that Le Peep is asleep both up front and in the kitchen. I did look at the computerized bill and there was no descriptor for how eggs were to be cooked or for the muffin. They must just trust the kitchen to cook it as they see best at any given time and if the waitress (yes, they were all females) is not on top of them the patron is at the mercy of the kitchen crew's judgement. With so many restaurants and other forms of eating establishment in Charlotte don't waste your time at this particular Le Peep. It appears that they are not worth a peep.",
        "I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. I know that people tend to surround themselves with like minded people, be it consciously or not, so the thought of the GOP being unable to ever win another presidential election has crawled into my head. (TL;DR in bold.) The social issues I'm talking about are: LGBT issues such as same sex marriage, religious freedom laws, \"bathroom bills\" involving trans people, etc. Their black and white stance on abortion- some of them want no exceptions for cases of terrible fetal deformities, threats to the life of the mother (Scott Walker in the last debate), rape, incest, etc. Fighting against contraceptives and the morning after pill that could prevent unwanted pregnancies and prevent abortions Pushing abstinence only sex ed. [37 states allow for medically inaccurate information to be taught to students as \"fact,\" so long as it scares them out of having sex. My school was one of the ones that taught blatantly incorrect information.] Claiming that anthroprogenic climate change isn't real, and pushing the teaching of intelligent design in public schools Marijuana legalization Being so biblereligion based when the population seems to be shifting away from religion Please please please change my view! I live in Ohio, so I really can't let myself slide into apathy thinking that the GOP has no hope of winning anything! You don't need to change my views on the social issues at hand, just convince me that another Republican president isn't out of the question! Edit 1: Wow! Lots of responses- awesome! It's going to take me a few minutes to sift through all this.:D Edit 2: Delta awarded- if a candidate like Hillary gets the democratic nomination and young people who are frustrated with government express that frustration by just staying home on election day, it will definitely give Republicans an advantage, no matter their stance on the issues. Edit 3: Please cite sources if possible. Feelings and anecdotes don't hold the same weight as things like polling data from reputable institutions, academic studies, etc. Edit 4: Another delta awarded- to uWhiskeyCoke77 for a good academic explanation of issue salience, how some voters find some issues more important than others.

        "It's a bad feeling when you walk away from a restaurant feeling that you've been ripped off. It can spoil the experience when you are focused on what you paid, and not on enjoying the savory feeling of the food in your mouth. My wife and I, at the Wrigley Mansion for my birthday, couldn't believe that this place is racking up a high average review. It was unbelievably bad. The food was marginal so marginal that we wondered, are we in the same restaurant that these others reviewed? And the deal that we went in with.... wow, what a loser. We had a Travelzoo prepaid voucher, which was supposedly worth 120. That voucher was for an appetizer, a soup or salad, and an entree. According to them, this voucher would pay for food for two that would at its normal price be valued at 120. And they base their add-on gratuity on this inflated figure, as well as the tax. What did we get? The appetizer was a one or two bite item two one-bite crab cakes, the size of quarters, and a teacup with one escargot in the bottom of it (our choices). The bowl of soup was actually a teacup as well. The entree we both had was a salmon, a very small filet, and when one of us expressed a concern about an allergy, they took the side dish away that contained the allergen and didn't replace it with anything. Most restaurants would have a baked potato or something to substitute. We ended up paying, after they added the gratuity in and the taxes based on the inflated retail price, nearly 120 for this dinner for two that included only two drinks, a well drink with house rum and a house cabernet. That was our voucher deal price. That's absurd.... the Salmon dinner could be had in a larger portion in any restaurant in town for 18-24. The cup of soup perhaps 5-7 and the microscopic tasting of an appetizer would be a courtesy item or certainly no more than a few . How does this equate to what we paid? While the views are nice at the Wrigley Mansion and the place itself is unique, this operation is using it as an excuse to gouge. Don't visit this establishment seriously, like many others, you will regret it. Stay as far away as you can from Geordie's. Spend your money at innumerable restaurants with better value in other parts of Phoenix. (The night before we spent 50 at St. Francis and it was incredible).",

        "It's coming up to Remembrance Sunday here in the UK, and at the moment the Poppy Appeal (where people buy paper red poppies and the money goes to the charity The Royal British Legion) is just starting. However it is near certain that I will not wear a poppy this year, and as per my title I see no reason to do so. Firstly, I've often felt that the whole thing, from the actual 11th November 2min silence, to the wearing of poppies, to the whole 'we shall not forget them' lines which get dragged out, have become for most people a case not of genuine remembrance but of simply going through the motions of a yearly event. Hell, I'd be willing to guess that aside from the usual litany of facts they learnt in school, most people couldn't tell you a single thing about the war, about why the poppy is important or anything. I also question why, given there exists a need for such services each and every day, and the problems and struggles of all those veterans don't just exist for one day, those same people who line up to wear the poppy then don't volunteer at a veteran's association, or go visit an old soldier living in a care home with no relatives or something. I don't doubt that there is that minority of people who do this, and I am a firm believer that those charities who do help veterans are doing amazing things, but I struggle to see how this can be juxtaposed next to the near overwhelming poppy overload you see out there in the streets. It's almost like the poppy is a cover for people's apathy, because they can wave their poppies around like some sort of magic hallpass that somehow proves they give a toss. I also find the need to publicly display any sort of remembrance highly inappropriate too. When the 11th comes, I'll offer prayers, I'll think of all those men who died, but I don't need to advertise that I'm doing this. It's an entirely personal thing between me and Allah. I should also add as a closing point that I am neither anti-war or anti-military, as this CMV might come across as being. I love and respect the military highly, and I accept war as a necessary evil. So, can anyone CMV? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] .

        "I don't like using the word \"awful\" to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time, effort, talent and money is spent in its creation but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt Charlotte Brontë's novel 'Jane Eyre' is a total waste of time.<br /><br />The script is lacking in finesse and power, everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms, leaving little to the imagination. The lead actors are woefully miscast, clearly hired for their star names, and the musical score drippy and dull. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all. She is like a wet noodle, worse even than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion. And William Hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy. Of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick.<br /><br />Joan Plowright's Mrs Fairfax is like some Disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out. <br /><br />There is no mystery surrounding the story of Rochester's first wife. The role of the would-be second wife, played like a Barbie Doll by Elle MacPhearson, is an empty cipher.<br /><br />Fiona Shaw, a very great actress, is completely wasted as Jane's Aunt, Mrs Reed. She would have been better-cast as Mrs Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, as Jane's beloved school teacher, evokes any authentic sympathy or believability. <br /><br />I saw this version of 'Jane Eyre' after viewing Robert Young's for British television, made in 1997, starring Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no comparison. Young's vital, romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to Zefferelli's wet squib.<br /><br />I will be interested now to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, about which I've read some very good things on this web-site. I am amazed at how many people liked Zefferelli's Yorkshire picture book. <br /><br />About all I can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored, beyond that it is a complete dud.",
        "Charles Kennedy has told voters his Liberal Democrats will offer them an \"honest choice\" at the next general election.With the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes, Mr Kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation. It is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the Lib Dems and the other two. With his party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, he has switched tack. Now he is promising to levy a \"modest\" increase of the same amount on earnings over £100,000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges. They are to scrap student fees, finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. That last policy will also see about 3% of the most well off paying more while others, pensioners in particular, will pay less.Labour and the Tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed.Inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services. The Tories claim they can improve services AND cut taxes through £35bn efficiency savings, while Labour has offered £22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals, although there is little chance they will propose increases. In many ways the argument between the Lib Dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between Labour and the Tories in the 1980s and early 1990s. But, unlike the old Tory-Labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see \"modest\" tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services. That is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts.Similarly there is a different tone to the Lib Dem approach to asylum and immigration, with Mr Kennedy stressing politicians should not \"foment an artificial debate\" about immigration and attacking Michael Howard's proposals for quotas. Once again, with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration, Mr Kennedy is stressing the different, more liberal approach of his party. Mr Kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party's election chances, declaring the Tories were not going to be \"significant players\" in the poll. He repeated his pledge not to do post-election deals with either party after the election. Mr Kennedy went on to suggest the re-election of a Labour government with a small majority would amount to a \"massive vote of no confidence \" in Tony Blair's government. That suggests the Lib Dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful, even pivotal position in a vastly different House of Commons after the next election. It is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before.",
        "Many people, experts or not, have said that humans are capable of seeing things when they are close to their arrival to or departure from this plane of existence. It is not uncommon for kids to be heard talking about imaginary friends or about previous lives. My mother once told me that I spoke of Venezia when I was four. I have no recollection of this incident, although my mother was quite adamant, and frankly, a bit spooked. I think this played a part in her belief of the other world. I remember when my grandfather passed away. My mother and he were estranged, as he was an alcoholic and she didn't want him to have a negative effect on us. When he died, she had told us that she felt him sit on the edge of the bed and dreamt about him telling her goodbye. I didn't know if I believed it or not, but it was a bit weird to hear my mother, a big authority figure, tell me of her dead father visiting her. Well into old age and having no kids, my wife and I decided a decade ago to move into a retirement home. She has since passed, leaving a void in my life incomparable to anything I have experienced. Meanwhile, I have begun to notice strange things in this gigantic waiting room. It seems like more people are arriving every day. Each morning, I notice someone different in the cafeteria. Given the size of the place, eventually I begun to question myself on the simple logistics of the situation: how could so many people live (and die) here? Every afternoon, the yard had more bodies crowding the place. The strangest part of it all is that they seemed to be speaking but no sounds echoed to my ears. The cafeteria was still quiet, even with the unbelievable amount of people wandering in and out. Unable to quite understand how the staff managed to keep it all under control, I kept pondering the situation until I remembered the piece of information I have written above. Ten minutes ago, I woke up to an incredible racket. It sounded like ten thousand people speaking loudly, the sound muffled by the walls surrounding me. This was unusual for a complex which was habitually so calm. I creaked my window open and was hit with a wall of voices, emanating from the now full yard. \"Let madness fill you, and hear the voices from the other world.\" was the phrase that I could make out. I closed my window and almost on cue, I heard a knock on my door. I shuffled over, expecting an attendant to be there with my medication. Instead, I opened the door and I felt the blood drain from my face. Standing there, with the dress she wore at her funeral, was my wife.",
        "It is more than twice the sum initially estimated in an inquiry into FN staff. The parliament suspects the money went to FN assistants who were not really working for MEPs, but were engaged in FN party work in France. The allegations - denied by the FN - have now gone to French investigators. Ms Le Pen is campaigning for the second-round vote in the presidential election on 7 May. Her rival, liberal centrist Emmanuel Macron, is ahead of her in opinion polls. The alleged fraudulent payments - from 2012 onwards - concern her and several other FN MEPs. The FN is highly critical of the EU, rejecting its liberal, free market agenda. Ms Le Pen says she is the victim of a politically motivated vendetta. What makes Marine Le Pen far right? In depth: Le Pen and rise of National Front The European Parliament is currently withholding half of Ms Le Pen's salary and expenses, as it tries to recoup money it says she owes. Currently the FN has 24 MEPs, France's biggest contingent. Ms Le Pen has refused to answer a summons over the affair in France, citing her immunity as an MEP. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says most voters drawn to the FN are already highly suspicious of the EU, and may not see the alleged fraud as a particularly serious matter. On Tuesday Ms Le Pen stepped aside as FN leader, saying she needed to be above partisan considerations in the presidential election. The FN's new temporary leader is Jean-Francois Jalkh, and he has immediately been caught in a row over a 2000 interview, in which he is quoted as doubting the Nazis' use of Zyklon B cyanide gas to murder Jews and other victims in the death camps. \"I consider it technically impossible - I repeat, impossible - to use it.... in mass murder. Why? Because you have to wait several days before you can decontaminate a place where Zyklon B was used,\" Le Monde quoted him as saying. When Le Monde asked him about the remark he called it \"utter rubbish\" and said he had \"no recollection of that [interview].\" A year ago the FN's founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was fined EUR30,000 (PS25,278; 32,600) for calling the Nazi gas chambers a \"detail\" of World War Two. He was convicted of contesting crimes against humanity. He got the same conviction in 2012 for calling the Nazi occupation of France \"not particularly inhumane.\" Marine, his daughter, drew strong criticism on 9 April when she suggested France was not responsible for a 1942 wartime round-up of 13,000 Jews, who were sent from France to Nazi death camps.",
        "\"Get to the Hard Drive Fields, and don't stop for nothin'. I'm much older and slower than you, so just get your ass there, and hide. I'll be there as soon as I can.\" Avi whispers to his grandson. Six o'clock sends a rush of darkness and silence through the halls like a wave of death as the fluorescents kick off simultaneously. Avi's young grandson Karl hadn't been living here a full year. He had not yet witnessed the chaos of the post-Christmas party delirium. Young Karl was not aware that his grandfather stored food throughout the frozen cooling tanks in the underground fields, and Karl had not gone hungry, so he was not aware of the desperation that hunger brings. The wave of darkness hits them, and Karl is sure he could feel it hit his skin. That feeling would dissipate as a much heavier rumbling bounces around in his chest. It is the pitter patter of feet weighed down by the fury of survival. Karl looks out of the Xerxes Toner Printer door he and his grandfather call home to witness a swarm of more hall dwellers stamping down their hall, B-Street. \"Go Karl! Now! Run as fast as you can! Grab all you can! I will do my best to hold them off!\" Avi screams over the rumbling. Karl takes off down the hall, his tote bags bouncing on all sides of him on their oversized leather straps, full of space reserved for party scraps. His thick rubber shoes squeak on the linoleum tiles, which reminds him of the year he spent at a real school, and he played kickball with other kids his age. He wouldn't realize how much he enjoyed that until it was gone. Now here he is, running up the corporate ladder hoping to catch a few crumbs. Upon reaching the end of the hall, Karl takes a quick look back to see his grandfather standing in the middle of the hall with his arms spread wide. Someone clips his left shoulder at top speed, dislocating it immediately. Even over the yelling, Karl hears his grandfather's screams as he is battered like a rag-doll, slowing a humble fifteen maniacal nomads. Not enough to matter. Karl turns back and pushes the door opened. It is now that he realizes his journey from here on out may be full of trials and tribulation, but he also knows the importance of what it means to survive. \"Here we go...\"",
        "\"So you just..... push it out?\" Marfa the Grey asked, raising her naked brow. \"Well, yeah,\" I answered. \"The contractions start, and you go to the hospital, and then once the contractions are really close together the doctor tells you to push.\" Marfa broke out in laughter. She waved to a group other female Greys behind her, who were busy trying the wine my husband and I had brought to the Welcoming Picnic. \"Girls, listen to the way they give birth. It's violent.\" I could feel myself turning red, watching my own two children across the lawn trying to reach a Grey child how to shoot a basketball. \"So go on, he tells you to push it out, and what happens? Does it just fly out of there?\" \"No, no, it comes out slow, I guess. Ew. I mean, it's really painful and hard, and can take a long time.\" \"I bet,\" an older Grey woman said with solace. \"And so what do you do with the placenta and the stem cells?\" asked a Grey, whose beautiful face I to look up to see. \"Well we really only just started saving them. But I guess most places just throw them out.\" They gasped. \"No wonder you're all so sick,\" Marfa said, her long fingers consoling her own cheek. \"Well, how do y'all give birth?\" I asked. They smiled at each other. \"We haven't carried our own offspring for centuries. None of the aliens species do. We also reproduce as far fewer rates than you do. I have to say I was quite shocked at how often you allow that to happen to you,\" Marfa said, gesturing to my belly. \"I understand that's where you carry them?\" \"Yes...\" \"We make our offspring in labs. They are formed in dishes and harvested in artificial wombs. We call them Ovas. We harvest all of the reproductive stem cells along the way and use them in just about every part of our medical field,\" the older Grey explained. \"Perhaps it's something we could teach you all to do,\" Marfa smiled. \"It's at least much less painful.\" At that moment, a fight broke out on the basketball court. The Grey child had summoned the ball telepathically out of the hands of my son Jimmy, who was now attempting to break through a tiny force shield to get to the Grey child. \"He's mine,\" the tall Grey said calmly. \"I waited 60 years to be able to begin the process of conceiving him. I watched as Jimmy gave up and started throwing a tantrum on the court. His sister started running towards me, crying. I turned to the Grey women and asked, \"So are you guys familiar with the term'hysterectomy'?\"",
        "Three Labour councillors in Birmingham were caught operating a \"vote-rigging factory\", an Election Court has heard.Police found the trio handling unsealed postal ballots in a deserted warehouse in the city during a late-night raid in June 2004, the hearing was told. The votes were later counted towards that month's English local elections. The men, elected to the Aston ward, deny collecting votes fraudulently. The judge presiding has indicated the whole postal voting system is under scrutiny. Deputy High Court Judge Richard Mawrey, QC told the hearing at the Birmingham and Midlands Institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming General Election.The special Election Court, the first in living memory to hear allegations of vote-rigging, opened in Birmingham last month. The case against Muhammad Afzal, Mohammed Islam and Mohammed Kazi is being brought by local Liberal Democrat supporters. They claim the trio benefited from the widespread misuse of postal votes during the 10 June election. Ravi Sukul, counsel for the petitioners, accused the three men of being \"deeply involved\" in illegal practices. Witnesses saw them carrying several bags from their campaign office, which the men drove to a warehouse on an industrial estate off Birch Road East, the court was told.The police were alerted and called to the premises. Mr Sukul said: \"When (the officers) arrived there, in the middle of the night, they saw a large room with a 10ft long table and six Asian men present. \"Hundreds of documents and unsealed envelopes were scattered all over the table.\" The police officers left the warehouse, but were later ordered back to seize the documents. \"When the officers left, all the envelopes and papers were scattered,\" Mr Sukul said.\"(When they went) back to make the seizure, every one of these 275 yellow ballot papers were placed neatly in envelope A and sealed. The house was in order.\" Interrupting Mr Sukul in his opening, Mr Mawrey said: \"What you are saying is, these men were operating a vote-forging factory on an industrial estate.\" The court heard how documents were taken by police to the elections office next morning, where they were mixed in with other ballots. The case against the men follows a hearing into postal fraud allegations made against three other Birmingham councillors in the Bordesley Green ward, claims which are denied. Mr Mawrey is due to deliver a judgment in their case once the Aston petition has been heard. Mr Afzal, Mr Islam and Mr Kazi deny conspiring to commit election fraud to deceive the returning officer. The case continues.",
        "Asian governments and international agencies are reeling at the potential economic devastation left by the Asian tsunami and floods.World Bank president James Wolfensohn has said his agency is \"only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster\" and its economic impact. The tragedy has left at least 25,000 people dead, with Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Indonesia worst hit. Some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. Millions have been left homeless, while businesses and infrastructure have been washed away.Economists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.In Sri Lanka, some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. For Thailand, that figure is much lower at 0.1%. Governments are expected to take steps, such as cutting taxes and increasing spending, to facilitate a recovery.\"With the enormous displacement of people...there will be a serious relaxation of fiscal policy,\" Glenn Maguire, chief economist for the region at Societe Generale, told Agence France Presse. \"The economic impact of it will certainly be large, but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005,\" he said. \"First and foremost this is a human tragedy.\" India's economy, however, is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed. The regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004. But India now faces other problems, with aid workers under pressure to ensure a clean supply of water and sanitation to prevent an outbreak of disease.Thailand's Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has estimated the destruction at 20bn baht ($510m). Analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country's tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit. Thailand's fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by Sunday's 9.0 magnitude earthquake, which sent huge waves from Malaysia to Africa. Malaysia said as many as 1,000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be \"significant\", Agence France Presse reported. Rapid rebuilding will be key to limiting the impact of the tragedy. \"In three months, we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces,\" said Juthamas Siriwan, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. The outlook for Sri Lanka is less optimistic, with analysts predicting that the country's tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly. Tourism is a vital to many developing countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).",
        "The Jeen didn't often explore the worlds that they discovered as much as they did this one called ' Earth '. It really showed promise. They knew it was called'Earth' and a lot more, because of the impeccable records these ' Earthlings'had left. So when they saw an opportunity to regrow one of these humans, despite not understand what they were doing, did it anyway. This is the story of Mike1 and his upbringing, as recorded in the Science log. Birth: Mike1 is created in a test tube, and has no human contact upon growing up. Instead, he's placed with a Jeen family that is warm, loving and filled with fun. In this family there are the same mother, father and 2 children you might find in a human family. Roughly translated, one child is a boy the other a girl. Scientists believed having one of each sibling would be optimal. Age 1: Mike1 has learned to walk, something Jeen children can do at birth. Mike 1's ' brother'and ' sister'both tease him relentlessly about it. Mike1 is starting to learn the Jeen language, but Mike1 is a slow learner. Scientists are concerned. Age 3: Mike1 can walk and talk, but his developmental milestones are not being reached. Scientists know what they are because they've thoroughly explored earth's libraries. The Scientists understand human development. Age 5: Mike1 is now in school with other Jeen schoolchildren. They are all learning the fundamentals of space travel, biology, and chemistry. While this is easy for the Jeen, for some reason it doesn't come quickly to Mike1. Scientists are concerned that Mike1 can't keep up. Age 7: Mike1 has now turned the corner. He leads the Jeen in all things sports related, academic related, and socially. He's popular with his friends who apparently enjoy his company. Scientists are happy, but cautious. The original plan was to create one human, see if it was safe, and then create more. Scientists hold off a little longer but are very optimistic about the human race. Age 10: Mike1 has completely subverted Jeen society with his influence. His love of videogames, something he had one of the scientists dig up, particularly games called ' Starcraft' ' Halo'had become a phenomenon. Jeen schoolchildren had never seen it before and Mike1 evangelized them day and night. At age 10 Mike1 could get the Jeen - children especially - to do whatever he wanted, he had that much power. Scientists were terrified, and hurriedly terminated the experiment. Jeen scientists lamented \" Why didn't this DNA come with a caution label? .\" They promptly corrected that, putting a big red sticker on the DNA as a warning.",
        "Anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average English bill rose 12.9%.Pensioners' protests spread - some marched, others simply refused to pay the increase. Some, such as 83-year-old Elizabeth Winkfield, said they would rather go to jail. The Audit Commission found the whole local government finance system was \"fundamentally flawed\" and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change.Labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. They say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a £100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be \"radical reform\". The party says this year's increases will be the lowest in a decade. A report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made. An independent inquiry into its findings, the Lyons review, is due to report back at the end of 2005.The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. They say they can save £4bn on \"government waste\", of which £1.3bn could be used to cut pensioners' bills by an average of £340. It would not be means tested, say the Tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of £500. The Tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to their value in 1991 - because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band.The Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland. The rate would be set locally, but administered by the Inland Revenue which they say would save at least £300m. They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because it puts a \"ceiling\" on what the richest pay. The party says it would aim for a £5,000 tax-free personal allowance, or a £7,000 allowance for the over-65s. After that income would be taxed up to £100,000. The Lib Dems say their plan is fairer, more efficient, has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.",
        "Heads and teachers have been complaining about deepening problems with funding shortages - with warnings they might have to cut school hours. The ministerial response shows 5 of council schools have budget deficits. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said funding gaps had become a \"national scandal.\" \"Over 1,000 schools are in the red. This should be worrying to every parent,\" said Mr Farron. His party had asked ministers how many schools and academy trusts, which run chains of schools, were in debt. There have been growing warnings from schools about problems with funding. The heads of every state school in West Sussex recently sent a letter to Downing Street, warning that they would have to consider cutting school hours or making teachers redundant if they did not receive emergency funding. They warned that schools faced a \"dire financial position.\" In a debate this week on school funding in West Sussex, MPs backed their concerns. Sir Nicholas Soames, Conservative MP for Mid-Sussex, said funding arrangements were \"unsatisfactory and unfair\" and budget shortages would have a \"damaging effect\" on schools. Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing, said there was \"nothing left in the tank\" for many schools and that head teachers were telling him that school finances were at \"breaking point.\" Head teachers say that budgets have not kept up with rising costs. There are also particular regional shortfalls, with the government postponing plans to introduce a national funding formula aimed at addressing local anomalies in funding levels. Education Minister Nick Gibb's reply to the question on schools in debt showed that in 2014-15 there were 113 academy trusts with a revenue deficit, representing 4 of trusts. There were 944 local authority schools in deficit, representing 5.3 of such schools. The National Association of Head Teachers said problems with school funding were \"very serious.\" A spokesman said a survey showed that two-thirds of schools were \"dipping into reserves to stave off deficits\" - and there were fears that rising costs would make this worse. \"I worry that in order for schools to bring their budgets in line to repay their debt, they will have to look at cutting staff, which makes up for 80 of the school expenditure,\" said Mr Farron. \"There will be less extracurricular activities, IT equipment or even books as cash is funnelled into clearing the debt.\" Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, called on the government to provide \"immediate additional funding.\" \"School budgets are being cut to the bone, and many more could find themselves in debt as the funding crisis worsens. \"We estimate that 92 of schools in England could face real terms budget cuts over the next four years.\" But Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"All academy trusts must balance their budget from each academic financial year to the next. \"We continue to monitor the tiny number of trusts which reported a deficit at the end of the academic year 2014-15.\"",
        "\"Please do not disturb my body, the experiment would be irrevocably ruined.\" I thumbed over the note another time. Not the real one, of course. That note was collecting dust somewhere in evidence. Unless some kind of miracle happens in the next twenty minutes, it'll probably never see the light of day again. And so begins the countdown: twenty years until we can legally destroy this \"evidence\" and free up some more space in our lockers. I know they're the words of a dead man, but it's getting hard to see this kind of shit as anything other than selfish. I guess it's hollywood's fault, this look on the new kid's face. He look concerned, like something supernatural is really here in the same room as him. He'll lose those eyes within the year, replaced with the jaded eyes of experience. Until then, I'm even sick of his naivete. Fresh faces just remind me of old partners, and why they won't give me a new one. Ahh crap. I got lost in thought for a second there. Now the lab guys are shuffling around trying to kill time while the rookie pretends to take notes. They'd all be adorable if there wasn't a dead man here we had to be responsible for. \"Look, I don't give a shit what you, or any of the media think about all this. He's been dead 48 hours, and with no family to report to and no suspicion of foul play, that makes him our problem now. Bag it and tag it. I don't care if Dr. Strangelove is waiting in the wings with a stopwatch and a voltmeter. This experiment is over.\" They all hum and haw. So much for being the senior man on site. \"Look, kids, it's not so hard. You put the body in the bag.\" I start shoving the feet in. The blood drains from their faces as I unceremoniously struggle to get a hundred pounds of meat into a federally approved sack. \"Look you idiots, there isn't a punchline. This stiff isn't gon na reach up and grab me. There is no crazy future-machine that's gon na bring his ass back from the dead. It's just another suicide with dillusions of grandeur. We get dozens a year in a city like this, and the sooner you learn that nothing is gon na happen, the sooner we can all just get back to our ordinary crap.\" Some of them reluctantly hold the bag open for me. I shove his elbows into place. By the time they see the next idiot crackpot with a cryptic note, hopefully they'll be over all their nerves.",
        "When the news broke out, outrage filled the nation. Our government has at times made follies in their policy, but no one ever thought that they would intentionally take the path of ignorance, when there is so much to explore in the space outside of our world. Protests broke out in D.C. We all felt betrayed. Where had the money gone? NASA has been operating under the guise of exploration for 50 years. 50 long years with almost no new developments, at least, not any that compared to the ground breaking trip to the moon. How long ago that was. As with all government controversies, a press release was called. But the anger that was felt by everyone waiting for answers kept their views biased and acute. Nothing they could say would fix this obvious destruction of trust. The press secretary arrived. \"The purposeful withholding of information was done, not for the gain of our government, but to prevent the loss that would be felt by it's people.\" What a bullshit statement, pretending like they did this for US. \"Despite what has been reported by the media, NASA's budget was not squandered, misused, or for lining the pockets of senators. NASA has been hard at work for decades, in the pursuit of the greater question. Are we alone?\" Oh god. What did they find out? Is this what we had been longing to hear since man first gazed up at the stars? \"NASA has been working hard mostly on it's telescope and radio detection technology, to determine if life existed out their, before moving along with the developments in space travel. This advanced technology has allowed us to peer at the very edge of the universe, to almost every star, and every galaxy, and we have determined, with absolute certainty, that we are in fact, the only planet that has been blessed with gift of life.\" It couldn't be. \"Knowledge, though important and enlightening, can also withhold one of the most powerful emotions we can experience. Hope. Hope that there is more out there. Hope that we will one day advance far enough to make contact. We felt it was in the best interest, to keep hope alive, instead of pursuing the dullness that is, knowledge.\" \"But this is not the end of exploration. Colonization is the next logical step. If we can't find life that has been intricately placed by the fate of the universe, we can at least take the one species that has, and spread it's reaches as far as possible. And then maybe, just maybe, someone can look up at the stars and know for certain, that there is more out there.\" Hope, has been restored.",
        "A judge has dismissed an attempt by Russian oil giant Yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the US.Yukos filed for Chapter 11 protection in Houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its Yugansk division by the Russian authorities. The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold. Separately, former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion.Mr Khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities. \"I pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees,\" he told a Russian court.Yugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (£14.5bn) in unpaid taxes. It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously-unknown group, which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company Rosneft.Texas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction. \"The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia,\" Judge Clark said in her ruling. \"Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government.\" Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston. Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts.In her ruling, the judge acknowledged that \"it appears likely that agencies of the Russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under United States law\". But she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction. The US court's jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft. Analysts said the ability of Gazprom and Rosneft to trade freely overseas had been stifled while the ownership of Yugansk remained unclear.Yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling. However, it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues. \"We believe the merits of our case are strong and simple,\" said chief executive Steven Theede. \"Our assets were illegally seized. We want them back or damages paid.\"",
        "Her apartment smelled like alcohol swabs and cigarettes. \" You sure I should be here? \" I asked, \" your parents are gone? \" \" Stop being a bitch. \" She tugged me through the front door and grabbed at my crotch, but the dark made me lose my balance. Instead of coming to a halt, I took a few steps then tripped over what must have been Tigger, their dog. He was latched onto the back of my ankle before I slammed into the linoleum, then she slammed the front door and Tigger and I both screamed. \" Oh my god, do you hear that? Your mom's home, she's going murder me. \" \" That's the dog running up stairs you fucking pussy. \" She slapped me just as I had gotten to my knees. \" Stay on your knees. \" She lifted up her skirt. No panties. But it was cold outside. She wrapped her leg around my neck and fell backwards onto the floor, we landed hard with my eye against her hipbone. \" I don't care if it hurts. Lick and suck \" She used my hair to pull my head into position. Black licorice. I kissed her. In a moment everything stopped. The light that bounced from her stomach twisted and condensed into nothing then expanded and surrounded me like a green bell jar, and I saw a great distance. Through the green I saw her sitting with her friends at our school's lunchroom. She spooned her fruit, Janeen had a new tattoo of a dragon, Mary was 2 weeks pregnant and craving mashed potatoes, and Susan was drunk on her fathers Jack Daniels. Now her bedroom in muffled lamplight. Her mother sat in the corner, motionless, in a dark pool. She was tied to her bed, staring at the ceiling. There was no life in her eyes. He was thrusting into her, and when he was done her stomach opened and green turned red. The smell of black licorice returned. It turned my stomach. I tried to fight it. \" Did I give you permission to stop? \" When I didn't reply she sat up on her elbows and look down at me. \" Sorry...\" I said, \"I'm sorry.\" It spread out across her legs like a black wave. \" Did you just puke on my kooch? \" she said with a calmness that made me retch again. Nothing came out. \" Get the fuck out \" (Sorry, I was going to continue but it would end up being too long, it think)",
        "The night was cold and the air stiff. The only source of light on the street was a dimly lit lamp above the front door of a small bar in the middle of the block, it's paint coat was chipping due to the winter cold. It looked beaten and unwanted even though generic upbeat music could be heard inside. My trench coat swung violently as the wind hit it dead on as if it was aiming for it, A pathetic attempt at covering myself and a deep sigh of frustration later I found myself inside the small bar, the loud music came from a jukebox in the back left corner of the New Yorkian brick-based architecture. It brought a comforting contrast of the old versus the new. Every patron inside was focused in their respective conversations, all but one. The old man slumped over the bar counter, the bartender barely acknowledging him as he swung glasses past him and flicked drinks in what was an almost blatant display of Spacial unawareness. the slumper wore beige dress pants held up by a brown leather belt with a blue dress shirt coupled with a light brown tie. He was absolutely motionless, I couldn't even spot the subtle hand trembling that signifies a hint of life. I've just realized I've been absent-mindedly standing at the door with both hands hidden inside my pockets, the bartender finally notices me and signals me to sit down. I take the only available sit, next to the old man. His drink, a half glass of whiskey on the rocks, laid there with water condensing on the surface of the glass leaving behind a ring of wet napkin embedded in the oak-wood counter. The glass looked untouched, his lips were dry and yet his hands merely hovered over the edge of the napkins, his index finger seemed to trace the paper square as if it was the last thing it meant to do. The rocks had already melted into pebbles floating at the edge of the cup asking for a way out. The water had already layered in the alcohol. It's been 15 minutes and the pebbles were now a lake sitting on top of the whiskey, undisturbed and peaceful. I took the hat on the table and after a quick inspection with teary eyes I placed it on his head, making sure it wouldn't fall. I pulled out the pen I use to sign legal documents at work, a black fountain pen with gold embroidery, and wrote a note to the bartender on my napkin, left enough money for both of our tabs and walked out. The note read: Make sure his family knows..... - Anthony Rose",
        "Social darwinism is an attempt to use Darwin 's idea of natural selection , or \" the survival of the fittest , \" to explain or , in my experience usually * justify * , the mistreatment of one group of humans by another . In normal polite discourse , it is almost never a good thing to be accused of being a Social Darwinist . Social Darwinism has an ugly history of being used to justify mistreatment of groups of people and even genocide . People who may subscribe to some ideas of Social Darwinism usually do n't like to use the term because of the ugly connotations . Here 's an example : why are some people poor ? The Social Darwinist would say some people are poor because they are dumber , lazier , or otherwise not as capable of competing with smarter , harder working , * richer * people . Similar to how natural selection causes less fit types of organisms get outcompeted by more fit ones , the Social Darwinist would believe that poor people will over time be removed from the gene pool because they can not compete with the people who are more fit . Basically , survival of the fittest for humans . Here 's where it gets really ugly . If you believe in survival of the fittest for humans , you might think it is in humanity 's best interest and therefore your duty to oppress or even kill the \" lesser people . \" This leads to all kinds of persecutions . How do groups wind up on the list of \" lesser people ? \" Usually , historical biases . Nazi Germany is sometimes considered to be a Social Darwinist regime ( there is some debate about their motivations ) . They believed the Aryan race to be superior to the Jews and gypsies and actively tried to kill them . By exterminating the undesirables they believed they were making the gene pool stronger . So Social Darwinism became a justification to murder millions of people they did n't like . It is pretty easy to see how Social Darwinism can be used to justify genocide . It is n't just genocide though . This principle was used to justify colonialism and imperialism as well . As with people and gene pools , it was believe that stronger cultures would dominate over weaker cultures . The prevailing thought was that Europeans and European culture were superior and therefore it was desirable that they ruled over other groups of people and destroyed their cultures . In a nutshell , under Social Darwinism if you do n't like a group of people you can justify your mistreatment of them by saying that you are strong and they are weak . Therefore , it 's a * good * thing when you mistreat them or kill them . This is all sorts of awful , and why Social Darwinism gets a bad rap .",

Too crowded Every thing depicted here is exactly how it is prescribed in bollywood textbook of romances. Plus you have to justify the length given to each story, as each has stars. Therefore, it is too long-three hours plus. The gags are filmy. Characters are filmy. Problems, Barriers, situations, resolution  yes you guessed it right, again. filmy-tried and tested. Same hundreds of dancers dancing in colorful costumes in background. Why they have no other work to do? All couples are sugary-sweet, fairy tale type, Picture perfect. All are good looking. Each story beginning in a perfect way and therefore should ends also in that impossible perfect manner? Too haphazard. You can't connect to a single story. Here you have everything that you already seen a million times. Bloody fake, unreal, escapist abnormal stories considered normal for more than hundred years since evolution of this Indian cinema. What a mockery of sensibilities of today's audience? Yes it could have worked as a parody if he just paid tribute to love-stories of yesteryear but alas even that thing is not explored. At least, Director Nikhil Advani should have attempted one unconventional, offbeat love story but then what will happen to the tradition of living up to the mark of commercial bollwood potboiler brigade? Oh! Somebody has to carry on, no. Imagine on one hand audience finds it difficult to sit through one such love story and here we have six times the pain. I mean six damn stories. I mean double the fun of chopra's Mohabbatein (Year 2000) In this age and time, get something real, guys. We are now desperate to see some not so colorful people and not so bright stories Oh, What have you said just now- come on, that is entertainment. My advice, please don't waste your time henceforth reading such reviews. Go instead, have some more such entertainment! Thank you.",
        "A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned.The Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Electronic Task Force. But the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. The problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF. Domain names are the \"real language\" addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. They are used so people can more easily navigate the web. So-called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used. So, for example, website PayPal could now be coded using a mixture of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet. The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'. But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. This is more than just a theory. A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Mr Dyer. As the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, Mr Dyer said. \"Although the IDN problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked,\" said Mr Dyer.\"It is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site,\" he added. There are solutions. For instance, browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. Mr Dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. Another solution, to introduce IDN-disabled browsers could be a case of \"throwing out the baby with the bath water,\" he said. CENTR, the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, agrees. \"A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world,\" the organisation said in a statement.",
        "Leading actor Edward Fox is one of the men behind plans to reopen a Swansea theatre thought to be Wales' oldest.The star of film and TV hits Day of the Jackal and Edward and Mrs Simpson has joined forces with Swansea-born actor-director Terry Palmer. They will set up a charity to raise money to buy the Palace Theatre, and hope to reopen it to audiences in summer 2006. It is estimated that £500,000 is needed to buy the Grade II listed building. The Palace Theatre, which will be known as The Pavilion Repertory Theatre, was sold to an undisclosed bidder at auction 13 months ago for £340,000. Before that it had been used as a nightclub for 10 years.Oscar-winner Sir Anthony Hopkins, who was born in nearby Port Talbot, made his professional debut there, and Charlie Chaplin and Lily Langtry have also trodden its boards. Fox told the South Wales Evening Post that after visiting the theatre he was surprised by its beauty. \"A lot of money needs to be spent on it, but all the bones are there - it just needs a beautiful skin,\" he said.\"To call it a jewel is not an over-estimation. There are not many theatres left like this. \"The hope for the immediate future is that we can attract enough people to come forward to allow it to prosper,\" he told the newspaper.Fox first found fame in the 1960s. One of his most memorable roles was as an assassin in the Day of the Jackal in 1973, and he won a TV Bafta as the Prince of Wales in 1980 for Edward and Mrs Simpson. He was brought on board to save the theatre by Mr Palmer, a long-standing friend of 40 years. \"Two years ago I decided to return to Swansea and do something for the city,\" said Mr Palmer. He said he was excited by the idea of running the Palace as a charity where young actors could develop, and with an annual Shakespeare festival in the summer. \"If in five years' time the theatre can function in all areas without me, I shall be well satisfied having helped to create a vital living theatre for the city,\" he added. Keith Poulton, a business adviser from Swansea, has already committed an undisclosed amount of money to the project. \"We need at least £75,000 to secure a deposit on the building and we've only got two months to do that,\" said Mr Poulton. \"A few benefactors have expressed their interest and Mr Fox is going to give it an awful lot of time,\" he added. Last year, roads around the theatre were cordoned off when masonry from its roof fell onto a car, but engineers said they were happy that it was safe.",
        "He said the prime minister's position owed less to \"great philosophers\" than the hapless sidekick from the 1980s BBC TV show Blackadder. Mrs May noted Sir Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick, was a Labour member. Sir Tony later described the pair as \"a beardy man and a grumpy lady.\" During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn and Mrs May argued over the government's yet-to-be-announced stance for when negotiations for leaving the European Union begin next year. The Labour leader accused the prime minister of presiding over a \"shambolic Tory Brexit\" and called for clarity and warned of the effect of it might have on the Irish border. Mrs May pledged no return to the \"borders of the past,\" saying a Common Travel Area had existed since 1923, and accused Mr Corbyn of trying to \"frustrate the will of the British people\" over the EU referendum. The government has said it will formally trigger Brexit talks by the end of next March, but has consistently refused to offer a \"running commentary\" on its negotiating stance. Prime Minister's Questions took an unusual turn when Mr Corbyn made reference to Baldrick, the turnip-loving and intellectually challenged servant to Rowan Atkinson's 1980s historical comedy character Edmund Blackadder. He said: \"When you're searching for the real meaning and the importance behind the prime minister's statement (on the recent European Council summit), you have to consult the great philosophers. \"The only one I could come up with is Baldrick, who says,'Our cunning plan is to have no plan. This was a reference to Baldrick's frequent claim to have a \"cunning plan\" to deal with the trickiest situations, but which nearly always turned out to be less than brilliant. Mrs May responded: \"I'm interested that you chose Baldrick. Of course, the actor playing Baldrick was a member of the Labour Party, as I recall.\" Sir Tony is a long-serving activist who has chaired proceedings at the party's annual conference - he has also been a recent critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. The reference prompted him to tweet, mocking Mrs May's oft-used pledge that \"Brexit means Brexit,\" by saying \"Baldrick means Baldrick.\" \"I'm in the hairdresser's,\" he later added. \"Suddenly a lot of people seem to want to talk to me!\" Returning to his put-upon alter-ego, he wrote: \"I never said nuffin' at PMQs, it was the beardy man and the grumpy lady.

        "\"Nero Forte\" is a song by American heavy metal band Slipknot. Produced by Greg Fidelman, it was released as the fourth single from the band's sixth studio album We Are Not Your Kind on December 16, 2019.\n\nBackground  \n\"Nero Forte\" was released on December 16, 2019 as the band's fourth single off their sixth studio album We Are Not Your Kind, following after the release of \"Birth of the Cruel\" four months previously. The song's title \"Nero\" and \"Forte\" are Italian words that mean \"black\" and \"strong\" respectively. \"Forte\" can also mean something in which you excel.\n\nRecording and meaning  \nThough the song title does not appear in the lyrics, it describes the darkness that Taylor sunk into. The depression was like an entity that he did not feel he had the strength to fight against. When talking about the song, guitarist Jim Root stated: \"This is also a Clown song, which is amazing. This one is going to be great live. It's very percussive and reminiscent of \"Psychosocial\", but maybe an evolution of \"Psychosocial\". Obviously, Clown is a drummer and percussionist, but he's also a songwriter—and he always has been. Now we're able to collaborate as songwriters, and this is what we end up with. When Corey came in and started diving into the vocals, he came up with this extra melody in the chorus line, very late into the process. That really drew me into this song.\"\n\nMusic video  \nShawn Crahan, Slipknot's percussionist and founder, directed the video along with a 20 minute short film titled Pollution, which would be released on the same day as the \"Nero Forte\". They were both recorded within two days, on both the 29th and 30 October. They were both initially to be released at some point during November, but for some reasons they did not come into fruition until a later date.\n\nThe \"Nero Forte\" music video stars the band, who jam out and perform in a white limbo, constantly flashed by coloured beaming lights, at points surrounding what seems to be a fan inside of a cocoon, which has something inside which appears to try to be trying to escape and be reborn.\n\nAs of December 2021, the song has 40 million views on YouTube.\n\nCharts\n\nReferences \n\nSongs written by Corey Taylor\nSongs written by Jim Root\nSongs written by Shawn Crahan\n2019 songs\n2019 singles\nSlipknot (band) songs\nRoadrunner Records singles",
        "No Taxation without Representation goes both ways, CMV Once a revolutionary slogan lamenting the lack of public accountability in spite of British taxation, now universally recognizable as a virtual truism at least within the domains of the U.S.; this phrase had been championed by countless many in protest of their lack of political leverage and representation, but I've almost had never seen the reciprocal proclaimed A simple search yields me less than 30,000 results in google as compared to the more than 2 million of the original phase. Nevertheless, if you do think about it, what gives the government the impetus to work for its people without some sort of rational incentive? Presumably, in accordance with the rational choice theory integral to our economical paradigm, governments, like firms, work for the highest bidder to maximize revenue. Here comes the interesting part, when common folks like us pay less taxes, governments will inevitably give less shit about us as well. i.e. Most petro-states are authoritarian simply because their governments can easily survive without revenue from their citizens. Now, before some of you go ahead and claim that there is another way of getting governments to do what you want through political participation. This theory has 2 flaws, 1) it assumes that all states are sufficiently democratic and 2) people are willing to be exercise their democratic rights. As it turns out, people subjected to less taxation have less incentive to direct where their tax dollars go in the first place. i.e. In heavily taxed democracies like France.etc the common people are much more keen in making sure their governments accountable by virtue of having more on the line. Note, I am talking about common people, not extremely wealth individuals, they have the social connections and \"donation\" power to by pass pretty much everything I've described. P.S. According the this Princeton report, the poorest 13 has no influence on the government at all. Ostensibly, this makes no sense since all votes weigh equally regardless of how much money you have, but if you consider everything I just said, its pretty clear whats going on here. I am quoting in verbatim: \"These income-based disparities in representation appear to be unrelated to disparities in turnout and political knowledge and only weakly related to disparities in the extent of constituents' contact with senators and their staffs.\" P.P.S I am not advocating for any partisan political cause, nor am I for taxing the 33 of the poorest to death just so they can have a say in government. (Seriously, who would actually be for that?) I am an alien from space, I come in peace.",
        "Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.New figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.The economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.Mr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"Consumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won't stick\".",
        "Institutions across the UK are likely to be affected by joint action by the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite. The unions have rejected a pay offer of 1 which they say represents a 13 pay cut in real terms since 2008. The employers maintain the offer is a good outcome for staff. The unions say they are willing to meet for last minute talks but say they are not optimistic \"as the employers had so far refused to engage in talks aimed at resolving the dispute.\" Michael MacNeil, head of higher education at UCU, said: \"There is widespread anger over the pay cuts staff have had to endure in recent years and all the reports we are getting suggest that Thursday's strike will be very well supported. \"We are amazed the employers are still refusing to sit down with us to try and resolve this without any need for disruption. There are precious few hours left now, but our offer of talks remains open.\" Unison's head of higher education Jon Richards accused university management of \"sitting on record surpluses, splashing out on senior management pay but refusing to give a decent wage to the staff who have made UK universities some of the best in the world.\" The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents the universities as employers, has expressed disappointment at the rejection of the offer. A spokesman for UCEA said that less than 5 of the higher education workforce had chosen to vote in favour of strike action and predicted \"a low level impact on students.\" The spokesman said that they had made their final pay offer in May and had been engaged in a dispute resolution process with the unions throughout the summer. \"We have met repeatedly over the last six months and as recently as last week.\" The spokesman added that \"salary costs in most HE institutions will actually rise by around 3 this year. \"Many staff will also get generous incremental increases and contribution pay. These pay increases will be seen as generous by many looking into the sector.\" He added that the GMB union had agreed to accept the pay offer for its members employed by universities. For Unite, the turnout for the ballot was 28 and of these, 64 (1,654 members) voted in favour of action. For the UCU the turnout was 35, with 62 voting in favour of strike action. Unison said that of those who had voted, 54.4 had been in favour of action and 45.6 against. UCU says its members last went on strike over pay in 2006.",
        "British and Irish Lions coach Clive Woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year's RBS Six Nations Championship.World Cup winners Lawrence Dallaglio, Neil Back and Martin Johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer's tour to New Zealand. \"I don't think you can ever say never,\" said Woodward. \"But I would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.\" Dallaglio, Back and Johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. But Woodward added: \"The key thing that I want to stress is that I intend to use the Six Nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark. \"My job, along with all the other senior representatives, is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team. \"If you are not playing international rugby then it's still a step up to Test rugby. It's definitely a disadvantage.\"I think it's absolutely critical and with the history of the Lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.\" Woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open. \"It is an open book,\" he said. \"There are some outstanding candidates from all four countries.\" And following the All Blacks' impressive displays in Europe in recent weeks, including a 45-6 humiliation of France, Woodward believes the three-test series in New Zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge. \"Their performance in particular against France was simply awesome,\" said the Lions coach. \"Certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five, but they're a very powerful unit.\" With his customary thoroughness, Woodward revealed he had taken soundings from Australia coach Eddie Jones and Jake White of South Africa following their tour matches in Britain and Ireland.As a result, Woodward stressed his Lions group might not be dominated by players from England and Ireland and held out hope for the struggling Scots. \"Scotland's recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances. \"Eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for Australia and I will take on board their opinions.\" And Scotland forward Simon Taylor looks certain to get the call, provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems. \"I took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking Lawrence Dallaglio when he wasn't fit and went on the trip. \"Every player has to be looked at on their own merits and Simon Taylor is an outstanding player and I have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip. \"I am told he should be back playing by March and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the Lions - and there are other players like Richard Hill in the same boat.\"",
        "Fuck That singular word echoed through my head, over and over. Even the emergency power had gone out now. I was alone in the darkness. Alone with that..... thing. Years of research, containment, and careful planning had all been washed down the drain. Experiment 626 was loose. My coworkers were all dead. Their corpses dangled from the loose ceiling tiles as if they were paper decorations that you would see in classrooms. Pristine, white lab coats were stained red and brown, rumpled on the floors. I thought I saw one move, and jumped back. It was..... It was just..... A colleague. Stephen, to be exact. A tall, wide, and rather muscular man was now a sobbing heap in front of me. His jaw was missing entirely. I looked around to see if anyone else was in the same condition, but it seemed only this Ox of a man had survived. I don't even know if I could properly call it that. Nothing could survive what we had unleashed. I thought back to the experiment's beginning. It seemed dangerous, yes. But it seemed like we could control it. \" That thing's a monstrosity! \" \" Monstrosity? What you see before you is the first of a new species. I call it Experiment 626. He is fire-proof, bullet-proof, and can think faster than a super computer. He can see in the dark, and life objects three thousand times his size. His only instinct..... to destroy everything he touches! \" Despite the warning from Dr. Jookiba, none of us took the thing seriously. The only negative thing the man ever talked about was his ex-wife. It was hard to believe that he had created some sort of monster. What made it even harder was the damn things appearance. Lost in my own thoughts, I slipped. My glasses shattered as my face made contact with the floor. I couldn't move. It's not that I was too shocked to do so, but the floor was sticky. Whether is was blood, or the slime from the creature's paw pads, I didn't know. Panic crept up on me as I heard it growing closer. The cracking of its spine as it rolled through the grates on the floor. Tantalog chants. Screams, shrieks, laughs. And then silence. \"What are you afraid of?\" It gurgled. I couldn't see it but I knew it was grinning. The wide, flat teeth that had ground through bones of my friends, family, my employers, and soon, the rest of humanity. I knew the inevitable was coming. Its hand pressed down on my neck, the four sharp claws puncturing my windpipe quickly. Stich was free. (Lilo Stitch, for those who may still be lost.)",
        "Every since I can remember, there were numbers in my head. Everyone had a number, a three for the boy who pushed me down the slide, a seven for those murderer's on TV, a four for my mother, etc..... I had never met a ten, nor a nine, and eights were only in other countries. Until I met him. He was beautiful. He was perfect and kind and lovely, he was everything I ever wanted in life. He was pure perfection. He mustn't have ever had a bad day because he was divine. But he was a ten. He was a ten in everything he did; he was a star athlete, head of the debate team, model student, and loving son. Everyone knew him, guys wanted to be him, girls wanted him, and I..... I was skeptical. What was different about him? He seemed to be perfect, but that couldn't be true..... I was very wary of this boy, this seeming deity of perfection, what would ever make him like this? I was terrified of him from the moment he said hello. \"Hey, I'm Alex, and I couldn't help but notice that you always seem to walk away whenever I'm in the room? Did I upset you or something? If I did, I'm sorry, a lady as beautiful as you should never have to be uncomfortable.\" I blinked in wide eyed fear, my eyes staring at his perfectly sculpted outstretched hand. What was wrong with him? \"Hey, now, I'm not gon na bite.\" I focused on his perfect lips and the way his white teeth broadened into a lovely grin. He was a boy that many fell in love with, but I wasn't buying it. I was different; I was that one weird chick that over analyzes everything- I didn't have emotions and that's why everyone stayed away. Cautiously, I outstretched my hand. \"Flora,\" I rasped, my voice low and uncertain. His smile grew wider and his hand enveloped mine. The shock that jolted my arm was unexpected, and I yanked my arm back as soon as our skin had met. His face developed into what seemed like a Cheshire grin. I saw the glint in his eyes, and I felt true terror for the first time in my life. \"Flora,\" he repeated, as if to test out the words on his own tongue, \"I was hoping I'd find you soon.\" He licked his lips and took a step forward.",
        "It had started as a ritual. A small coping mechanism to help him deal with his loss. He'd come out to her favorite park and push her favorite swing, feeling her weight, not in his arms as he once had, but in his soul. Every day, for two months. And every day, as he'd leave the park, he'd bid her memory a tearful goodbye and walk to his car. He told his wife he was staying late at the office, because he couldn't bring himself to mention their daughter and see her tear up. He knew she'd been grieving in her own way, and he'd made sure he was there for her. But he had to be strong, had to be the warm comfort she needed when she called for her daughter before remembering. Women and children first. Me, I can tough it out. Maybe when she had her closure, he'd tear off this makeshift bandage and deal with what was underneath. But for now, his duty was to protect and serve his wife. He went home. Dinner was followed by a movie, one they'd been meaning to watch whenever the TV wasn't occupied by Barney and Doc McStuffins. It was a good movie, even great; but they'd have willingly turned it off and watched the giant purple dinosaur sing his inane song for the seven hundredth time, if there would have only been a reason. After the movie, a good romantic comedy that left her in tears, he held her close until her ragged breaths came regularly again. Then bed, and eight more hours of accounting the next day. Five o'clock. He drove to the playground, pretended she was meeting him there after the daycare across the street, let out. But when he got there, there was a little boy, sitting in her swing. It takes an unbelievable effort to control himself, and the boy sees him, jumps out of the swing and runs to him, saying, \"Why are you crying?\" The boy's mother quickly hurries him off to play on the monkey bars, and he composes himself (mustn't let her see him all worked up) and goes to meet her on the swing. She's happy and bubbly as always, telling him about the mean boy who stole a cracker from her during snack, and about the picture she made for him I left it there, Daddy, it wasn't dry yet. But soon enough, five o'clock become five-thirty, and he must tell her goodbye and go home, where she'd never get to go again. Someday, he promises her. Someday I'll be here to stay.",
        "I agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film. I found it incredibly silly (at best) and downright misleading, misinforming and harmful (at worst). Like others, I found this film to be an awful mix of \"real\" science and pseudoscientific, New Age propaganda. <br /><br />As a psychologist, I was especially offended by Candace Pert's contributions. True, I was not a fan of hers before this film, but her discourse on the \"consciousness\" of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term (\"consciousness\") that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify. It is an old Orwellian mind-f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay \"Politics and the English Language.\" To refer to \"consciousness\" in this manner--indeed, to refer to this film as \"based in science\" in general (which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by Stalin when he labeled his slave-states \"democratic republics\" and Hitler when he called his party a \"socialist workers\" movement.<br /><br />I don't claim to really understand quantum physics. I know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study. Ah, but we Americans do love \"instant enlightenment,\" and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish. If it ASKED questions, that would be one thing, but it clearly attempts to ask and ANSWER them, which no film could possibly do simply because we are far, far away from the answers (if they indeed exist).<br /><br />By the way, ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several \"expert commentators\" with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (and TM), not to mention J.Z. Knight, who often speaks in her \"Ramtha\" voice. (I'm always amazed at this channeled 10,000 year-old Atlantean superman's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology. But then again, this film argues that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10,000 years ago, I suppose he could exist now and tomorrow. Only, then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers? Oh, I forgot, I'm the creator of \"good\" and \"bad\" advice, so it's all my fault, not Ramtha's.)<br /><br />What a mess.",
        "Jerry Alan Fodor (/ˈfoʊdər/; April 22, 1935 – November 29, 2017) was an American philosopher and the author of many crucial works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science. His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, and he is recognized as having had \"an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960.\" Until his death in 2017 he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University.\nFodor was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation.[citation needed] He argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.\nFor Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or \"organs\", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the \"central processing\" part of the mind, which has a more global and less \"domain specific\" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.: 73–75 \nAlthough Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses.

This hearkens back to the \"birther\" movement, and all of the conservatives who have some mistaken conception that our president wasn't actually born in Hawaii, and therefore is not a US citizen, and is therefore not eligible to hold office. Aside from that, however, it got me to wondering - what would it matter if that were true? What if Obama were born in Kenya, then moved to the United States at a very young age, was raised here, and lived his life working towards becoming a public servant and eventually president? Is there any indication that he's not fulfilled his obligations in the exact same way as someone who was physically born in the US, instead of some East African nation? Which brought me back to something I've thought about before: Why do we still cling to Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the US Constitution, which stipulates that the president must be a natural-born citizen of the United States? I understand its importance in a historical context - as a fledgling nation, we needed to be assured of the patriotism of any potential Chief Executive. But in the 21st century, the United States is a much more variegated population, and we've already seen some prominent politicians who wouldn't qualify to serve as president based on that strict standard, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, or one of my favorites, former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm. So, I believe it's time to revisit this section of the Constitution, and amend it to include naturalized citizens. We can leave in the part that requires a 14 year residence, or even increase it, if we're that concerned, but I think following a dedicated leader who has lived in this country long enough to be interested in serving it in a fairly thankless job is proof enough that they wouldn't abuse the position to unduly serve their birth nation instead.

        "The answers you'll receive are going to be largely subjective. I can't tell you which option would be best for you, but there are plenty of things to consider.  Do you know how to sell a home? If your market is hot enough, FSBO may make sense as you won't need the marketing power and expertise of an agent. In very hot markets, you'll end up with potential bidding wars if you price your house correctly. But that's where things start getting tricky. Do you know what your house is realistically worth in your market, or are you making assumptions based on Zillow (or similar)? Do you know what paper work is needed to complete a FSBO sale? Are you any good at negotiating? There are certainly plenty of resources out there for FSBO sellers to learn how to do it, but it can be overwhelming.  FSBO isn't really fee free. If the buyer has an agent, they'll want a percentage (3%) for setting up their part of the sale. Without experience in negotiation, you may be leaving a decent amount of money on the table. Also, in negotiations, an experienced agent may nickel & dime you with contingencies all the way up until closing. Then there's anything you might need to pay for marketing materials and time off from work (if needed) to have the house shown. However, if you're in a market where people are literally walking up to your door to ask if you'd consider selling and for how much (which just happened to a friend of mine), then it might actually be a pretty painless process.  Traditional agents charge a fee, but that fee goes towards marketing and their experience in sales and negotiations. They do the work of getting your property in front of the right people and setting up house showings. The work is done on your behalf, and you won't need to alter your personal work schedule anywhere near as much as you would with FSBO. They only get paid if the house sells. Limited service agents are a bit of an unknown to me, but it's more than likely the buyer will have an agent, so assume the higher fee. It also appears that the LSA gets paid at least $500 no matter what happens, so they're certainly not putting in any extra effort to help get your house sold. It appears that you're simply paying to get on their list of homes and get some marketing from them, but that's about it. I'd imagine you could get the same exposure as a well educated FSBO seller.",
        "The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its \"golden rule\", a report suggests.The rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and not to finance its spending projects. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) claims that taxes need to rise by about £10bn if state finances are to be put in order. The Treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008. According to NIESR, if the government's current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is \"unlikely\" the golden rule will be met. Should the cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to \"50/50\". Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, NIESR said.The report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. Earlier this month, accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic.It claimed revenues were likely to be £6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was \"on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond\". \"Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable.\" Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy.It said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the \"world economy will continue to grow strongly\". Global gross domestic product (GDP) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. The US will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in Japan. Hinting at better times for UK exporters, NIESR said the euro zone \"is expected to pick up speed\".Growth in Britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast. \"Despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006,\" NIESR said, adding that \"the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery\". GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. The main cloud on the horizon, NIESR said, was the UK's much analysed and fretted over property market.",
        "Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness said his mother Peggy was \"traumatised\" to learn the truth. He was talking to BBC journalist Peter Taylor for a TV documentary to be broadcast on Monday, 29 September. The former IRA commander from Londonderry joined the IRA in 1970, shortly after the Troubles began. He said he had not told his parents about his membership of the paramilitary organisation. \"My mother found, I think it was a black beret or something like that, in the house and it immediately traumatised her, I think,\" he said. His mother, Peggy McGuinness, died in 2008 aged 84. Looking back on the moment when she found out, he said: \"She did not hit me with it or anything like that or if there were gloves, there was no smack across the face with the gloves. \"I think that it was a moment in time and she was obviously annoyed at the prospect that all of our lives were changing and maybe mine more dramatically than anybody else's.\" On 30 January 1972, the Army shot dead 13 innocent civil rights protesters in Derry on Bloody Sunday. Martin McGuinness was second in command in the IRA at that time. He later addressed the Saville Inquiry, set up to establish why those people were killed. The inquiry found that Mr McGuinness was present at the time of the violence and \"probably armed with a sub-machine gun\" but did not engage in \"any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire.\" He rose to become a senior figure in the IRA and Sinn Fein and was involved in negotiations with the government that led to paramilitary ceasefires and the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. In June 2012, he shook hands with the Queen on her visit to Northern Ireland - a photograph that became a symbol of reconciliation. Earlier this year, Mr McGuinness attended a Windsor Castle banquet hosted by the Queen marking the state visit to Britain of Irish President Michael D Higgins. The deputy first minister has also called for a border poll in Northern Ireland on unification with the Republic of Ireland and said he was fighting politically for reunification. In recent years, Mr McGuinness has insisted his job had become a political one. \"My war is over,\" he said. \"My job as a political leader is to prevent that war and I feel very passionate about it. \"I want to build a better future for all our people. It is a political project, not a military one.\" The documentary Who Won The War will be broadcast on BBC One NI on Monday 29 September at 21:00 BST.",
        "There's no way to escape the heat of the New Orleans summer. The air filled my lungs with desperation, and my clothes with dripping, salty sweat. After the hurricane, our electricity was shot and not even the fan, with its mocking, motionless blades, could quell my tortured soul. I took to counting the cracks in the ceiling to pass the time before finally succumbing to sleep. By late August I could feel my mind beginning to seep out of my ears and onto the splintered wooden floor of my bedroom. The heat had driven me mad. It must have started with the occasional wisp of cool air through the cracked window above my bed. I shivered with delight as these little bursts of relief came wafting through the room and down into my spine. Maybe the summer isn't so bad after all, I thought. I could finally rest without waking in a sticky heap of my own stench. I gradually came to depend on each fleeting escape, now a surging burst of frozen ecstasy that cooled my body and mind to a perfect balance of bliss and relaxation. I didn't leave my room much anymore. Why suffer through the stifling summer heat when the frigid sheets of my unkempt bed kept drawing me back into a liberating embrace? One particularly chilly morning, I awoke suddenly and realized I must have fallen asleep with my head propped up against the headboard. My neck was stiff and my eyes struggled to adjust to the light trickling through the window. I reached out to the glass of water on the table, but for some reason all the energy in my body couldn't muster the strength to lift my arm from my side. Panic set in. I tried to form a word but my lips cracked and allowed thick blood to drip down my chin. My throat quivered and I felt ice breaking and dropping into my stomach as I watched the door creak open to reveal a ghastly figure clad in a tattered black cloth. It sauntered deliberately over to the bed, swaying like a sailor until it stood over my frozen body and stared into my cold eyes. The blood had already crusted over my lips, my eyes beginning to burn from the piercing stare of the dark figure. And then it lowered its head, extending its pale mouth towards mine, sticking, locking on to my icy orifice. I felt the little warmth I had left drain through my mouth and into the creature. Cold numbed my mind, my core. I no longer thought. I became nothing, and I watched with dimming eyes as the shadow silently slipped out through the window above my bed.",
        "Greek officials had been expected to meet representatives of EU creditors in the Greek capital Athens on Friday. But a European Commission spokeswoman later said those representatives would arrive \"in the coming days.\" Separately, Greece formally submitted a request for a new loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In a letter to IMF head Christine Lagarde dated 23 July but released to the public on Friday, Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos wrote that Athens was \"seeking a new loan.\" Greece had initially planned not to ask the IMF for more funds, reports say. Greek MPs have approved tough new conditions set by the EU lenders for talks on the bailout. It is unclear when IMF officials will be joining the negotiations. The Washington-based IMF wants Greece's debt burden to be reduced to a level it considers \"sustainable,\" but it faces resistance from reluctant European partners. EU officials said on Friday that there were \"logistical issues to solve\" before high-level talks with Athens could begin, but that negotiations were taking place at a technical level. The Greek team had been expected to meet top representatives from the European Commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and European Stability Mechanism (ESM) - the eurozone's main bailout fund. Talks on the bailout package are expected to last a month. Tight capital controls, introduced at the end of June, remain in place to prevent a run on Greece's cash-strapped banks. PM Tsipras faced a backlash from MPs in his own left-wing Syriza party, during two parliamentary votes on austerity measures required by the creditors in order for negotiations to start. But he secured parliament's backing after a second crucial vote passed early on Thursday. The reforms debated this week included changes to Greek banking and an overhaul of the judiciary. Last week, Greece passed an initial set of austerity measures, including tax rises and pushing back the retirement age. Mr Tsipras has said that he is not happy with the measures imposed by creditors but that his government was forced to choose a \"difficult compromise\" to avoid Greece exiting the eurozone. A decision on more contentious measures - phasing out early retirement and tax rises for farmers - has been pushed back to August. Demonstrations have taken place on the streets of Athens against the bailout deal and trade unions have taken strike action. On Wednesday, the ECB increased its cash lifeline to Greek banks by EUR900m - the second rise in a week. The IMF confirmed on Monday that Greece had cleared its overdue debt repayments of EUR2.05bn and was no longer in arrears. The repayments, which included EUR4.2bn to the ECB, were made possible by a short-term EU loan of EUR7.16bn. Greece's next major deadline is 20 August, when it must pay EUR3.2bn owed to the ECB, followed by a payment of EUR1.5bn to the IMF in September.",
        "They say the last major improvement in automobiles were Antilock Brakes, and before then it was automatic transmissions, and before then the internal combustion engine. Since then, we can probably plonk hybrid drive-trains in there, a la the Prius, but electric cars are destined to replace even those, like they were a temporary stopgap. Yet the electric car can't be considered a new thing, either, since they were around over a century ago. All we've done is improve the battery chemistry a bit and progressively improve the efficiency and torque of the motor. For computers, we can trace the modern WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointers) interface all the way back to Douglas Engelbart's \"Mother of All Demos,\" where he used a wooden mouse to showcase a primitive version of what later turned into the Xerox Star, then the Apple Lisa, the Mac, and Windows. The biggest improvement since then has been touch, which came seven years ago with the first iPhone. But touch is just a minor improvement on the mouse. Really just a simplification of the mouse. We're still tapping on screen buttons and flicking windows around. Things almost seemed to get interesting with [CORBA] and the idea of component software. Microsoft had something similar, called OLE: you could embed an Excel spreadsheet in a Word document, and when you clicked on it the underlying Excel executable was loaded, shoved some of its UI on the screen, and loaned its functionality to its sister app. And then all that disappeared. There's nothing really like that anymore. HTML sorta kinda wants to evolve in that direction, where you can embed videos in a web pageCORBAOLE-ishlybut it's not really a combining of functionality, it's really more like a boxing and containment of it. The plugins and codecs get a nice little rectangle to live in. Chickens in a coop. Everything on computers is still dominated by the App. We flirted with \"Document Oriented Interfaces\" in the 1990s, two decades ago, and then it died. \"There's an App for that\" is the real business and software development model of our time, and I think that's sad. Apps hoard their features jealously, they don't share them. Mega-Pro Plus GoldTM has the Twonk feature, but if you need the features exclusive to UltraDingus HDTM you're stuck. At best you convert document formats and shuffle them back and forth, or wait for one company to acquire the other and figure out how to convert from C to Objective-C or vise-versa. We could be doing more, but we aren't. We're dominated by brand names and App-centric mentality, and it sucks. Change My View.",

        "He told Buzzfeed News he needed to go to a \"quiet place\" to focus on writing, adding that Twitter is \"the least quiet place I've ever been in my life.\" \"It's like taking the bar exam at Coachella,\" he said. \"I really need to concentrate on this!\" Some have labelled his portrayal of female characters, including Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, as sexist. The criticism came as a surprise - as the writer-turned-director had previously been praised for creating strong female leads in his TV shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Dollhouse. He said, \"I saw a lot of people say,'Well, the social justice warriors destroyed one of their own!' It's like, nope. That didn't happen.\" Whedon also denied the accusation that he quit Twitter because of specific criticism from campaigning group Feminist Frequency. \"Literally the second person to write me to ask if I was okay when I dropped out was [Feminist Frequency founder] Anita [Sarkeesian],\"he said. Immediately prior to deleting his account, Whedon tweeted: \"Thank you to all the people who've been so kind and funny and inspiring up in here.\" Soon after, a search for an account under the josswhedon handle returned a \"page not found\" error. One critic had created a widely shared montage image showing many of the messages sent to Whedon. Some called him misogynistic and said he had done a \"hatchet job\" on Black Widow, whose big storyline in the latest Avengers film is a doomed romance. One critic asked why the words \"strong female character\" were not in his vocabulary. But many of Whedon's fans have now turned on the naysayers, subjecting some to harassment and abuse. Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt accused them of having \"chased Joss Whedon off Twitter.\" Whedon had previously been a high-profile user of Twitter, calling it \"enormous work - very fun.\" But he told Buzzfeed he had started to become uncomfortable with his habit. \"Twitter is an addictive little thing, and if it's there, I gotta check it.

        "When property changes hands the sale prices may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of the property, and they may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of other properties. Because of the nature of the transaction: you already have an existing business relationship, the local government is likely to ignore the data point provided by your transaction when determining values of similar properties. They have no idea if there was some other factor used to determine the price. They will also not include in the calculation transactions that are a result of foreclosure becasue the target price is the loan value not the true value.  California and some other jurisdictions do add another wrinkle. You will need to determine if the transaction will trigger a reevaluation of the property value. In some states the existing laws of the state limited the annual growth of the assessment, but that could now be recaptured if the jurisdiction rules that this is a new ownership: California Board of Equalization - Change in Ownership - Frequently Asked Questions How does a change in ownership affect property taxes? Each county assessor's office reviews all recorded deeds for that   county to determine which properties require reappraisal under the   law. The county assessors may also discover changes in ownership   through other means, such as taxpayer self-reporting, field   inspections, review of building permits and newspapers. Once the   county assessor has determined that a change in ownership has   occurred, Proposition 13 requires the county assessor to reassess the   property to its current fair market value as of the date ownership   changed. Since property taxes are based on the assessed value of a property at   the time of acquisition, a current market value that is higher than   the previously assessed Proposition 13 adjusted base year value will   increase the property taxes. Conversely, if the current market value   is lower than the previously assessed Proposition 13 adjusted base   year value, then the property taxes on that property will decrease. Only that portion of the property that changes ownership, however, is   subject to reappraisal. For example, if 50 percent of the property is   transferred, the assessor will reassess only 50 percent of the   property at its current fair market value as of the date of the   transfer, and deduct 50 percent from any existing Proposition 13 base   year value. In most cases, when a person buys a residence, the entire   property undergoes a change in ownership and 100 percent of the   property is reassessed to its current market value.",
        "The obvious original purpose of these policies was to ban student groups that would create unsafe learning environments for other students. For example, Neo-Nazi student groups would be an example of something we would generally wish to avoid, lest they start attacking Jewish or other minority students and creating unnecessary conflict. I'm not a fan of censorship, but I can at least see how this is reasonable in situations where there is real danger of inciting violence. However, these policies have been given extremely wide interpretations as of late by the student unions who administrate them. They first started being used to ban nonviolent MRA groups and shut down Men's Resource Centres. They have also been used to ban Pro-Life student groups. They have even been used to ban the Campus Gun Club, which does nothing but teach gun safety and organize trips to the range. There have also been attempts by some universities to ban Conservative and Libertarian groups altogether, but so far at least these attempts have been, to my knowledge, unsuccessful. In short, they justify banning groups on the basis that they could cause distress for people in a vulnerable position. For example, there was much discussion of gun violence and the effect on minority communities when they banned the gun club (which was of course completely irrelevant to what the gun club was actually about). However, that justification is clearly bogus. If we went by that standard, many other groups would need to be banned. For example, the Marxist Club would need to be banned because it is offensive to students of Eastern European and Latin American descent. I personally find it offensive (although I would tolerate it if they were willing to tolerate the other groups). The Feminist group, which is often extremely disruptive and hostile in their public demonstrations would need to be banned. The Pro-Choice group would need to be banned for being offensive to Christians. And so on and so forth. However, there has never been any hint of banning these groups, presumably because they are left-wing and the type of student to get involved with the student unions agree with them. I think this is an unfair double standard, and these policies should be scrapped entirely or rewritten to provide an objective standard of enforcement CMV. Source: Hello, users of CMV!

        "James Holmes, 24, is accused of opening fire at a midnight showing of the new Batman movie last Friday, killing 12 and wounding 58. Judge William Sylvester has denied a request by Denver-area media for expanded coverage on 30 July. The suspect's lawyers had objected to the media's request. His first court appearance on Monday was filmed, despite the defence team's objections. He appeared dazed as he sat in court in a burgundy jail suit with dyed orange hair, prompting media speculation about his mental state. According to a report on ABC News , the suspect has been forced to wear a face guard because he kept spitting at prison officers. Judge Sylvester's order on Tuesday follows calls from some victims' family members to avoid using the suspect's name and his photos. \"I don't want the media to be saturated with the shooter's name,\" said Jordan Ghawi, whose 24-year-old sister Jessica was killed in the shooting. Police were not allowing residents of Mr Holmes' apartment building to return on Tuesday, as investigators continued to work there. Officials reportedly found 30 grenades and several gallons of gasoline inside the apartment, rigged into a booby-trap. Twenty of the wounded remained in hospital on Tuesday, including six in critical condition. Batman star Christian Bale visited victims at the Medical Center of Aurora in the afternoon, the hospital's president confirmed. \"It was good for the patients,\" Bill Voloch told the Denver Post. \"We hope it was therapeutic for them, and all the staff really appreciated him coming.\" Mr Voloch said that the actor had asked to visit, but requested that the media not be notified. A Facebook photo of Bale at the hospital was posted online. The BBC's Alastair Leithead says the actor also met paramedics, doctors and police officers involved in treating people in the aftermath, as well as visited a makeshift memorial to the dead. Meanwhile, a heavily pregnant 21-year-old woman who escaped the cinema shootings gave birth to a baby boy on Tuesday morning. Katie Medley's husband Caleb, a 23-year-old aspiring comedian, was shot in the head and remains in a critical condition. A small group of Democratic lawmakers in Washington renewed calls on Tuesday to ban high-capacity gun magazines. But with November's elections looming, congressional leaders and President Barack Obama said there would be no movement on gun control in the near future. Senator Robert Menendez, among the few calling for tougher laws, conceded calls for legislation were unlikely to succeed, but said it was important to start a debate. \"I hope that this does spark a national conversation about where we go in terms of reasonable gun control measures,\" Sen Menendez said. The shooting has heightened security at cinemas, and over the weekend three men were arrested in separate incidents:",
        "Nico Rosberg headed team-mate Lewis Hamilton by 0.505secs after the Briton made a mistake on his best lap. And the German was a massive 1.834secs quicker than Kimi Raikkonen, third for Ferrari, on the same'soft' tyres. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat were fourth and fifth as Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was 11th on the medium tyre. In windy and comparatively cool conditions - it was only 21C and overcast when temperatures are more usually in the mid-30Cs at this race - Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne made his debut in Formula 1 as stand-in for the injured Fernando Alonso. Vandoorne, who had not driven the 2016 McLaren before Friday, flew in overnight from Japan, where he had been testing the car he races in the Super Formula category, and was 18th fastest, 0.952secs slower than team-mate Jenson Button. However, Vandoorne's best time was set on the medium tyre, which is about a second slower than the soft on which Button was running when he set his fastest lap. McLaren racing director Eric Boullier said: \"He did very well - it is not easy to step in to this high-tech car with a lot of processes to learn. He knows most of them but doing it for real is very different.\" The comparison between the two will be watched with intense interest through the weekend as it is effectively a partial audition for the job of Alonso's team-mate at McLaren in 2017. Button is out of contract at the end of this season ad Vandoorne, McLaren's reserve driver, is the most highly regarded not to have a regular F1 drive. At the front, Rosberg and Hamilton were only 0.081secs apart after their first runs on the soft tyre - with the German again marginally ahead. On their second flying laps, Hamilton was quicker in the first sector, but then dropped half a second in the middle sector of the lap. The gap between the Mercedes and the rest are not likely to be representative - Ferrari were almost certainly on a different programme. The Italian team have brought two more sets of the medium tyre for each of their drivers than Mercedes for this weekend and appeared to be focusing more on establishing whether that is the correct tyre for the race. Behind the Red Bulls, Force India's Nico Hulkenberg was sixth fastest ahead of the Toro Rosso pair Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen, the Haas of Romain Grosjean and Williams' Felipe Massa.

        "A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned.The Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Engineering Task Force. But the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. The problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF. Domain names are the \"real language\" addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. They are used so people can more easily navigate the web. So-called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used. So, for example, website PayPal could now be coded using a mixture of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet. The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'. But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. This is more than just a theory. A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Mr Dyer. As the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, Mr Dyer said. \"Although the IDN problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked,\" said Mr Dyer.\"It is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site,\" he added. There are solutions. For instance, browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. Mr Dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. Another solution, to introduce IDN-disabled browsers could be a case of \"throwing out the baby with the bath water,\" he said. CENTR, the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, agrees. \"A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world,\" the organisation said in a statement.",
        "I took a flyer in renting this movie but I gotta say, it was very, very good. On all fronts: script, cast, director, photography, and high production values, etc. Proves Eva Longoria Parker is head and shoulders in rom/com above bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who mug and call it acting. Who'da thunk it?<br /><br />Parker and Isla Fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as \"Over Her Dead Body.\" Lake Bell is excellent, too, and this is the first time I have seen her. And finally, Paul Rudd gets to shine in a really good movie, instead of lesser films.<br /><br />A movie like this never gets its dues from close-minded males. It's too bad. As other IMDb reviewers here have noted, there is nothing lame about this gem --no hack writing or acting. <br /><br />And its depiction of contemporary L.A. and California, in general, makes every scene look bright, beautiful, clean, and otherwise outstanding in every way. Never before has a movie made L.A. look so good. Ah, what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie.<br /><br />I won't divulge the plot, but as a long-time and hard-core atheist, I was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light-hearted piece of entertainment. It reminds me very much of the old \"Topper\" movies, which were also so enjoyable.<br /><br />This movie exposes popular, but otherwise hackneyed, movies like \"Ghost\" for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are. We already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre. Some of us save our praise for the truly worthy, however.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as \"Into the Night\" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, \"Blind Date\" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, \"American Dreamer\" with JoBeth Williams, \"Chances Are\" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, \"Making Mr. Right\" with John Malkovich, etc., you'll enjoy this. <br /><br />A first-rate job all around (even if it's kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years.) But even that plot device doesn't detract from the movie's overall excellence.",
        "The goods: 1) Its an all in 1 casino...there is food, gambling, childcare, a movie theater, a bowling alley....HUGE. 2) The cheapest rooms are really nice. 3) The extremely deep tub with television in the bathroom for relaxing. 4) Its Vegas... 5) The spa facility - wonderful! The bad: 1) The check in at this place is AWFUL...and thats no way to start off. They had 2 people working and a line of over 20 when we came in, also there was no set line so you had people just standing everywhere. 2) The minibarPAY tray - There was a tray on the dresser that if you accidently even bumped stuff off it...if you didnt get it back on fast enough cha-ching! They charged you. I dunno about you but 1- I usually drink when Im in vegas and its hard enough to not bump stuff sobber...2- this is suppose to be kid friendly....my 6 year old INSTANTLY was eyeballing this tray....We had to get them to remove it. 3) The Imax in this facility is beyond bad. BAD...the room is extremely tiny...and they fail to mention that if a seat is RED that nothing can be seen in 3D and infact that it will just appear double. 4) The distance to the strip. It's over 20 mins away. 5) The price of the spa facility...its super lush and super nice....admitedly, but the price dampens that bit of fun by quite a bit. Your looking at 150 for a 50 min massage. 6) Amenities fee, wth is THAT? 30 a night (not including the room taxes) and Im not even sure what thats for. Why not just roll that into the price of the hotel, so you arent wacked with it later? 7) Food Poisoning....We had the buffet the first morning of our stay...needless to say, my 6 year old and my husband ate something there and ended up vomiting the rest of the stay. Made the food bill cheap thou! They didnt eat anything the rest of the stay! (sarcastic) All in all, Im not sure I would go back. I know what to expect now, but the cons out weighed the pros. The kid's quest hourly child care would be about the only thing to lure me back, and they have that at other casinos.",
        "\"They stole him. They stole my son.\" \"Ma'am, please calm down. We have every single officer out there looking for hi The middle aged woman slammed her fists down on my desk. I reached for my taser, but stopped short when she collapsed and started sobbing. \"You don't get it, do you!?\" she cried out between tears. \"Do you really think you're looking for'him'? Do you really think you're looking for a body!?\" It was true. With the invention of the Consciousness Transferal Network (CTN), Internet crime had taken a very dark turn. Identity theft was a much larger issue when you could steal more than a social security number. It started as a cosmetic upgrade for the rich; We had made leaps and bounds in the development of synthetic bodies over the last century. At the start of the 21st century we could replace 80 of a human with synthetic parts, 40 years later we could replace 100, and we were starting to make synthetic organs that worked better than the original ones. Many diseases and cancers were made redundant once the synthetics became more affordable. Got lung cancer? Just replace your lungs. Certainly a lot easier than chemo. For the rich and elderly, many replaced their whole bodies via CTN in order to extend their lives as long as possible. From there, some video game genius created a'synthetic arena', where you could CTN your consciousness into a colourfully painted synthetic and fight someone else's synthetic in a boxing ring. It quickly became the new esport and was televised internationally. Then the man-in-the-middle attacks started. Popular pro-gamers in the synthetics arenas were being kidnapped mid-stream. No one knew where they were going, the world's best networks specialists had been attempting to track them for months, but the CTN files were always moved to offline storage. That was the type of case I was dealing with. This woman's 19 year-old boy had been taken in a man-in-the-middle attack as he was logging in from home for a competition. He engaged the CTN transfer with his body safely in stasis, then that was the last anyone heard of him. \"My condolences, ma'am,\" I managed. \"I can only assure you that we're doing everything we can. If you could please bring his computer to our lab we might be able to identify how it happened.\" At the very least, in these types of crimes the victim was always'alive' so long as their CTN data existed, so hope to find them okay would never die. I'm never sure if sitting on a memory card in some thief's locker somewhere really counts as'living' though. I love this prompt, it has so much potential!",
        "Examples are not hard to think of. I live in a multicultural Dutch city. My teacher used to remark that any traces of \"openly gay\" kids disappeared as soon as Muslim kids started entering the schools. I notice this in day to day life as well. You hardly see anyone who \"looks\" or \"talks\" gay. Similarly, it's reported that Jews are afraid of going out with yarmulkes because they get harassed in the streets. What I notice in my multicultural community, more so than the \"diversity\" is the homogeneity. People look the same. They try to adjust to their group average, instead of seeking to deviate from it. Similarly, youth subcultures seem to have disappeared. Except for some metalheads, the diversity of expression and personality of youth seems carefully concealed in today's Dutch society, whereas I remember as a child that things were different in this regard. Instead, this is these days hidden behind walls of festivals, such as Summer Darkness or Elf Fantasy Fair, which are (unsurprisingly) about 99.9 filled with white people. The places that do still have some semblance of diversity in this regards, are the places where few if any ethnic minorities live, that is, outside of the large cities near the sea. What about the immigrant minorities themselves? The minority communities are homogenizing as well. Immigration severs the connection to the country of origin, and oral traditions are lost. The cohabitation of a variety of immigrant communities (Somali, Turkish, Moroccan, etcetera), whose only shared cultural heritage is Islam leads to a situation of group-polarization, in which they exaggerate the one cultural element that defines them in opposition to the Dutch majority. You will find more Turkish girls with headscarfs in an immigrant neighborhood in my country, than you will find in Istanbul. In contrast to this, I look at monocultural places like [Helsinki, Finland] and [Tokyo Japan] , and see the diversity of expression that I remember seeing traces of in my own country. Similarly, it's not multicultural Sweden or Norway that have the highest percentage of Neopagans, but Iceland, where the only size-able minorities are people from other European countries. I therefore think that multiculturalism will eventually eliminate all traces of diversity in indigenous Europeans. Instead, every European group will be absorbed into its larger parent culture, until we reach the point where there exists no more \"British culture,\" \"Irish culture,\" \"Jewish culture,\" \"Biker culture\" or \"gay culture,\" but rather, only \"white culture.\"",
        "Research carried out by the Fostering Network suggests almost half of fostered young people are already living with their third foster family since going into care. The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are \"urgently\" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to \"open their hearts and homes\" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. \"Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,\" she said. \"I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a'normal' loving family. \"They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. \"They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman.\" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: \"As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. \"We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. \"In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. \"A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members.\" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. \"We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.\"",
        "It seems like most people around us at least own a TV. I have not touched TV for at least a year, and when I do it is usually very brief. If I do not have a TV now, I cannot find any excuse to it. I find TV useless when one could afford a computer with decent internet connection. Why? Let me list my reasons. 1. TV alone cannot do everything PC can, and PC can do almost everything TV can. Sure you could watch sport on TV, but you could do the same on internet. Sure you could watch news on TV, but you could watch those same channels on internet, and have other choices such as blogs. Those movie and TV show are available on PC from providers like Netflix, while other extremly popular medias available on computer like YouTube are not available on normal TV. Smart TVs have them, but they cost more than regular TV, and you may as well buy a decent computer. 2. TVs are poor substitute for computer monitor. I could buy a decent 1440p 27 inch PLS monitor like this: Or I could spend similar amount of money for 720p 32 inch TVs like these: BestBuy may not always be the best place to buy TV, but you still can't get a better monitor replacement with another 100: Other than that, there are other more technical problems to use TV as monitor replacement, and we could discuss it on request. 3. Gaming quality on computer is at least on par with TV, if not better. I don't want to stir up another war of PC vs Console, but I think it is safe to say PC could provide similar gaming quality at the same cost as console. In addition, PC have more choices such as MMO and upgrade potential. This means people could pay more on PC to get a premium experience, while consoles only offer its potential in a very narrow price range. If a person own a decent TV, there is a good chance that he also own a computer. Buying a decent graphic card as an upgrade is not really more expensive than buying a console, and the TV itself cost separately. Again, I will elaborate on this upon request. 4.TVs are not mobile, while laptops are. Even if they are, things like chromebook defeat their purpose. 5. Computers don't really cost more. If you pay for TV channels, then you could pay for internet. I personally find internet more important than the latter. As well, you get could still get access to those shows with internet. As stated in point 2 and 3, TVs are not really that much cost effective either. What is the point of TV now? Edit: View change: TV is useful for a group of people, and especially in a family with young child. View change: TV is not in danger of rapid decline in at least a few years.",
        "So being an English speaker based in America, I hear a lot about rape, whether its in the news, or on billboards, or even in statistics. One of them stood out to me, it was that 1 in 4 college age women will be raped by the time they graduate. Thats certainly a shocking statistic and it really got me thinking about the prevalence of rape in my community (Im a US college student) Well, after looking up the statistic from the Department of Justice [Here] it refers to acquaintance rape as the main culprit in this statistic. It also states that rape is the most common violent crime on campuses around the country. But from my understanding, a majority of rapes are not the stereotypical, dark alleyway, knife point situation, but rather some male figure abusing his position of power and dominance to force a girl to have sex. One of my close friends actually came to me and told me about this one guy who \"just wouldnt give up trying to have sex\" with her, and while she originally said she was okay with it, I later went with her when she wanted to report it to the school. Later on I heard a story just like hers at a rally against rape culture at schools. Anyway, enough of the statistics and anecdotes and more to my view that I want to be challenged. Both the alleyway situation, and the guy who would not accept no for an answer are sexually assaulting people, but I believe that we either need to change our lexicon to differentiate between the two or we need to find a more prudent way of expressing the difference. I study linguistics at school and the [Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis] , assuming it has at least some truth to it, and even some other theories ,indicate that our choice of word influences our impression and understanding of an idea or situation. Acquaintance rape still uses the emotionally charged word \"rape\" and while we can certainly understand the difference between the two, it is impossible for us to truly separate our mind from the imagery of the back alley when hearing about \"rape\" allegations. That being said, I still believe both are crimes, and both should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law as they are now. Sexual assault seems to be a blanket term that covers a multitude of situations, from the violent rape, to a lack of consent. Furthermore rape seems to be used in situations when sexual assault would seem more apt, and perhaps rape has become a blanket term, rather than a specific one, which bothers me. But could there be any harm whatsoever from creating and refining a new set of words and definitions concerning \"Rape\"? Edit: Also I'd like to add another reason I believe this change to be necessary is to allow us to avoid using the term \"rapist\" to perpetrators of lesser forms of sexual assault, and instead have a more fitting description of them.",
        "Bergdahl is a very contentious figure and continues to be despised among many in the military . Basically , he was unhappy with what he saw as inadequate leadership and negligence by his superior officers . He apparently tried to voice his concerns to higher - ups a number of times , but did not feel he was listened to . It seems that he had the same issues with command as a lot of intelligent and idealistic people would . But , after listening to Serial and hearing interviews with Bergdahl , one ca n't help but notice that he 's slightly ' off ' ; there 's something odd about him . Almost in an Asbergers- like fashion . He just could n't reconcile his childlike fantasies of heroism , honor , valor , etc . with the everyday realities of being on a military base in war - torn Afghanistan . So , one day , for reasons that are n't absolutely clear , he decided to just walk off base and into the desert . The taliban - controlled desert . Bergdahl fancied himself quite the physical specimen : he thought that he was going to get the attention of higher / ups in the military by walking off - base for a while , through the terrain of Afghanistan , and showing up at some other base to a grand reception later on , where his concerns would be heard . At least , that was the plan in Bergdahls mind . In reality , he was quite conspicuous as a milquetoast white boy in the middle of the afghan desert : the Taliban quickly captured him and took him prisoner , overjoyed to have him as a bargaining chip . The military , upon realization that he was gone , deployed a massive - scale rescue operation to retrieve him , as per the philosophy of ' No man left behind ' . This operation affected the course of the war at that time . While looking for him , soldiers found themselves in places they would n't have been and doing things they would n't have been doing if he had n't gone AWOL . And , as happens in war , some soldiers died during these operations . These soldiers ' families and loved ones , as well as other military people , attributed these deaths to Bergdahl 's selfish actions , and thus they see him as being responsible for those deaths . Bergdahl was finally rescued , and there were a lot of mixed feelings about how he should be treated , if he is indeed a traitor or just misguided , and whether his actions lead to the deaths of other Americans . So , a lot of people hate him and think he 's been given a slap on the wrist . Edit : Bergdahl did n't walk off into an actual desert , as has been pointed out . The Paktika province is mountainous and arid , certainly not friendly to outsiders .",
        "Laura was kneeling on the grimy flagstones of the street, examining the latest victim. A gaping wound ran across his neck and the letter'M' had been cut into his forehead. She forced down her desire to be sick at the sight of the gaping wound, and examined his patched clothing with a faded red shoulder badge noting the cryptic series of letters written in blood next to him. She carefully took of his shoulder badge and read what was written on the reverse,'Peter More, B Negative, Mutant'. She stood up and tried unsuccessfully to brush the grime off her trousers. Her partner walked over to her, looking disdainfully at her. \"That's the third murder in this area this month. Is it the same as the other two?\" Laura nodded \"Yes, his throat was cut and a'M' was cut into his forehead\" \"And the numbers?\" \"There as well and different again\" \"Go and see if any of the local residents know anything\" Laura nodded and walked away from him towards the nearest building, she could hear other police units arriving now. The building was a large grey imposing structure roughly cut from the stone of the cavern and was one of several sounding the dim square where the body had been found. There would be large numbers of people crammed in each one sometimes whole families to a room. Which was why he sent her to question them, she could question them a lot faster than any of the other officers. It was how she had managed to join the police thay certainly would not of taken her otherwise. She had reached the building and lent against the rough rock next to the imposing metal doors. Laura closed her eyes and concentrated. The music started, it had overwhelmed when she heard it for the first time but now she had learnt how to focus on one song at a time. Thay sang of the person it belonged to, of their fears their hopes their experiences and their innermost desires. The music of their soul. Carefully she focused the songs on last night. Nothing. The walls were too thick for them to hear anything and the cavern too badly lit for them to see anything. She gradually went around each of the buildings, listening and focusing. Each time nothing but the sad stories of their occupants. Laura sighed and walked back to her partner who had watched her completing her loop, his eyes disapproving and untrusting. She shook her head at him. He turned away and began talking to one of the forensics officers. Laura turned and walked to the caverns exit, playing with her red shoulder badge.",
        "What do you want from a sandwich shop? Well, if you can start with a love of sandwiches, it's a good sign. Caffe Espresso - Bingo. The Number 9 baguette has long been legendary in my workplace and so I toddled in with high expectations. When the lady before me ordered something simple, the man behind the counter served her with cheery mock-disapproval, claiming that the order was not a sufficient challenge. When I then asked for the legendary Number 9, he lit up. The Number 9? That's my BABY! he declared in delight, and immediately set about compiling its various delicious ingredients for me (grilled chicken, taco sauce, cheese, rocket and jalapenos). I don't know about you, but for me, a fellow who can talk so passionately about a sandwich is definitely the person I want making my lunch. His infectious enthusiasm led me to explain that this was my first sampling of the legendary Number 9, and his mood elevated still further. It'll change you, he promised, and began explaining the spiciness options. I pondered a moment over Entry-Level or Smokin'. You know what, he continued, I'll do you a half-and-half if you like! Oh, I do. I do like. Thank you. I had a moment at this point to glance around the weeny shop - about the size of my bedroom, the walls covered in boards reciting the most mouthwatering sandwich combinations imaginable and some pretty spectacular-sounding smoothies. It's homely, colourful and cheerful, with even a tiny bit of space to sit and eat if you can't bear to take your sandwich away from its birthplace. For less than PS5, I was - as promised - lifted to a higher plane of sandwichness. Another previously Un-Number-Nined colleague, beholding my delight as I returned to my desk consuming the legend, ran straight out to get one for herself and found herself equally transported. I don't think I've ever been so overwhelmed with joy by a mere baguette; while the enthusiastic service and jolly establishment go a long way toward this score, the proof of the sandwich shop is in the sandwich. The baguette: warm, crusty and soft. The filling: rich and perfectly balanced. Don't expect to eat it elegantly, though; there's a lot stuffed into that baguette and it tends to behave with the same wild exuberance as its creator. I can't wait to try the rest of the options on offer, and some of those amazing-sounding smoothies. Until then.... this has been a YUMinator review, starring Sarnie Schwarzenegger.

        "The move to make the state property registry secret is not yet law - it still has to go before parliament. TI, an anti-corruption watchdog, said the new measure would \"raise the impunity of government officials.\" It was proposed by the Federal Security Service (FSB), successor of the KGB. A government committee approved the proposal this week. Most Russian MPs are government supporters, so it looks likely to become law. \"This could make it harder to tackle money-laundering and illicit enrichment,\" said Andrey Zhvirblis, deputy director of TI's Russian branch. TI's annual Corruption Perceptions Index gives Russia a poor rating for 2014. It ranks 136th out of 175 countries, below Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Mexico. The FSB also wants to block public access to registries listing officials' ownership of planes and yachts. But many of those assets are registered overseas, often by companies, whereas home ownership in Russia is more serious, Mr Zhvirblis said. The FSB argues that ordinary citizens should be denied access to the Unified State Registry of Property Rights, a real estate database. Only official bodies would be allowed to use that data freely without the property owner's permission, under the FSB plan. The FSB says that criminals have abused open access to the registry, and that commercial databases are profiting from the personal data. Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, has exposed cases of civil servants owning property that appears lavish compared with their official salaries. Before the open registry's introduction in the 1990s, Mr Zhvirblis said, there were thousands of abuses involving fraudulent claims to property. The new measure risks making home ownership and tenancies less secure and \"will affect almost everyone,\" he told the BBC from Moscow. Currently a buyer can get the necessary ownership details from the registry for just 200 roubles (PS2; 3), he said. Even so, he pointed out, \"it just gives the plot of land and owner's name\" - not more personal data. Mr Zhvirblis said it was not the role of the FSB to draft Russian laws, and \"it's strange that it's becoming an entity doing that.\" President Putin ran the FSB in the late 1990s before becoming president. He had been an officer in the Soviet KGB, the communist secret police. The news website Lenta.ru says the new proposal coincides with certain restrictions on Russian access to offshore havens. Western financial sanctions on Russia, as well as global anti-corruption efforts, have made the offshore option less attractive, it reports. Putting a veil of secrecy on property in Russia could reduce the incentive for officials to keep their wealth overseas.",
        "It was in the evening, I got a call on my voice mail while working. I'm a hotel manager, and the police know me from our nights of belligerent or uninvited guests. I live alone and no one visits since I moved to a rural town. \"Mr. Smith? This is Kerry down at the station. We found a troubled man outside your home, with a dog collar on with your name and phone number. He keeps repeating your name. If you could get down here and help us find out who he is would be great.\" I didn't know anyone who would be in town to visit. Let alone someone wearing a dog collar other than my Black Lab named King Louie. So, I ask if the two front desk if they got it for the rest of the evening, and leave the hotel at 6 p.m. I get into the station and they escort me to a holding room, on the other side of the glass is a fit black man in sweat pants. \"We barely got him into the pants, he kept howling and saying'Luther'.\" Kerry looking forward, \"if you like you can see him.\" \"I don't even know this man.\" \"Well, we tried to get off his collar but he bit Walter. We just figured he was a troubled man,\" the man started sniffing the air, scurrying towards the glass. \"Luther?!\" He shouted in a deep voice, \"LUTHER!\" Curious and scared of a fit black man calling my name, I work up the courage. I knock on the door and walk in. \"LUTHER!\" He shouted and knocked me to the floor. His tongue was surprisingly long. He placed his fists on my shoulders and I could feel his knees digging into my stomach. \"Oh Cripes. Up boy!\" I said like a knee jerk reaction. \"So you do know him?! Is he your lover? I'm not judging but we just couldn't find any prints on him or...\" \"No, I do not know this man.\" The large toned black man was wrapped around my leg. \"He seems to be attached to you for some reason.\" I looked down into his eyes and seen my friend for the past three years staring back. He was about 6'1,\" a solid 180, his hair was black and curly. I felt like I should get him out of here all of a sudden and said, \"Cousin Louie?!\" He looked up and said, \"Home?!\" Crap, right in the feels. After some paper work and a court hearing for humping one of the female officers, we were on our way home. \"King Louie?!\" I asked when I turn on the car. \"YES!\" He barked.

The official said he had received a call from a colleague - whose name is also redacted - at the FBI's International Operations Division. The colleague said he had been contacted by Mr Kennedy asking him to change the email's classification level in \"exchange for a'quid pro quo'.\" The State Department, the FBI document says, offered to \"reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden.\" Mr Kennedy, according to the FBI documents, followed up on this matter at a subsequent meeting, spending 15 minutes attempting to influence the FBI to unclassify the Clinton email. He also pressed FBI assistant director of counterterrorism Michael Steinbach on the issue. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said the revelation \"bears all the signs of a cover-up.\" Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted: \"Unbelievable.\" Mr Kennedy, who has spent more than four decades at the State Department, was already a lightning rod for Republican criticism. He oversaw both diplomatic security during the 2012 attacks in Benghazi and the records and IT departments during Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server. But State Department Deputy spokesman Mark Toner denied any wrongdoing by Mr Kennedy. \"Under Secretary Kennedy sought to understand the FBI's process for withholding certain information from public release,\" Mr Toner said. \"As has been reported, there have been discussions within the interagency on issues of classification.\" The email in question was among some 100 messages recovered from Mrs Clinton's private email server that the FBI would ultimately designate as classified. The FBI and State Department engaged in a review of the former secretary of state's emails as they were being made ready for public release. FBI Director James Comey concluded in his investigation Mrs Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in handling the classified material. The scandal has fuelled the perception among many voters she is untrustworthy. The emails scandal relating to her private server is different from the messages that Wikileaks have been releasing recently.",
        "Amarmandakh Sukhbaatar was performing in the country's capital Ulan Bator when the alleged attack took place. Russian news reports said he was hit over the head with a bottle and repeatedly kicked in the face. The Russian embassy said it was investigating, but called local press reports \"distorted.\" The rapper had taken to the stage in a red deel - a Mongolian robe - embroidered with a swastika. Though associated with the Nazis, the swastika is a traditional symbol in Mongolia that pre-dates Hitler. Mr Sukhbaatar's father, Sevjidiin Sukhbaatar, told a news conference that his son spent about 10 days in a coma after the beating. \"My son was hit in the face several times with a metal object and was seriously injured. His brain was seriously hurt,\" he said. Mr Sukhbaatar displayed a book of traditional swastika patterns to emphasise that it is not a hate symbol in his country. The Russian official accused of attacking the rapper has not been identified. In a statement, the Russian embassy said it was investigating press and social media reports of the assault. \"According to our preliminary information,\" it said, the reports were \"distorted, particularly about the date, the number of participants and the circumstances of the accident.\" Tens of millions of Soviet citizens died fighting the forces of Nazi Germany during World War Two. The swastika is believed to have originated in India thousands of years ago, and was used in Mongolia as a symbol of eternity centuries before the Third Reich. Amarmandakh Sukhbaatar - who is known as Amraa and is the lead singer of the band Khar Sarnai [Black Rose] - frequently wears the symbol on stage, and his songs often refer to his country's history, culture and identity. The swastika is also used by groups on Mongolia's far-right however. The musician's lawyer, father, and a band member denied reports on social media that he shouted \"Heil Hitler\" at the show. Lawyer Gankhuugiin Batbayar said the suspect in the beating had not been arrested, adding: He] must be investigated according to Mongolian law, no matter his status or immunity as a diplomat.\" A police spokesman told the AFP news agency that the case was under investigation. \"The suspect is a Russian diplomatic officer and the reason he wasn't kept in detention is the injury is not serious,\" he said. \"It's not true that the suspect wasn't arrested because of diplomatic immunity.\"",
        "Read below the line of this post you'll see my prior post. I am a regular, or was a regular now! I never come in on Monday's, I usually come in on Friday or Saturday. This is the first time I ever met Bale. I normally get served by Sarah Jenn (who are the best I like dearly). This night, Sarah served my first beer. When Sarah went on break my beer was empty and I set my glass on the edge of the bar so the bartender knows I am ready for another. Keep in mind, I am by myself at the end of the bar. I see her look at my glass and walk away at least two times to serve others at the other end of the bar. The third time I wave her down and she doesn't even give me a I'm sorry I will be right with you (recognition of some sort). So I do something I never done before and that is poor my own beer. Now, I got her attention! After explaining to her why I did what I did (the fact that she was deliberately ignoring me), Sarah comes back from her break, and I explain what happened. Sarah knows me and was very nice about her reasons of having to kick me out. It is illegal to pour your own beer, now I admit, I was not thinking about that at the time, yet I am glad that happened just to prove a point. It took me doing something like that to get Bale's attention, what does that say about a person like that. In conclusion, I was told I can come back another night, but because of my action Sarah had to ask me to leave, I want to note that Sarah has always given me great service. However, because of one person, Bale, I will not be coming back to this bar. I have more class than that, to let someone treat me like I am nothing, when I am a consistent customer. The sad thing about Bale, it is people like her that leave me hopeless in seeing this local economy thrive again. I moved back to this neighborhood to support this area, yet people like her have made me decide to move back close to my job in downtown Phoenix Everyone has to understand, I grew up in this area. If you're a native like me, you'll understand, if not, you probably will not care. The bottom line is thanks to the internet consumers like me have a voice. Bale has got to go! Love this place. Great dive bar, the bar tenders are really nice, they have the tall boy beers I like mini pitchers for a good price. I was impressed how much a crowd this place can draw in.",
        "OK, I know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as Watership Down is a \"classic\" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18, I must admit: I really hated it.<br /><br />We watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people who whimpered at the very words \"Watership Down\"- their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams- recommended it. To be honest, I wish I hadn't bothered. I gave it the benefit of the doubt; generally I don't like to stop watching a film half way through. This was an exception. It was really, really, excruciatingly, sickeningly dull. This film was possibly the slowest thing I've ever watched (imagine a doped-up snail in space), and really didn't \"do it\" for me. The art was alright; the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee, yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into huge details about the storyline; basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area. Generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across. For me, I kind of wished that they would get gassed, not because I'm a horrible sadistic person, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, dull and generally quite rude (oh I'm so terribly English). I found that I was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film, and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax.<br /><br />If I were to praise it in any way, I'd have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well-meaning. Maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy, but the message it's trying to put forth is good in its nature. The musical score was not bad, too.<br /><br />So, to conclude, this film is pretty poor. I couldn't watch it the whole way through, or I'd probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom. Granted, it isn't \"Torque\" bad, but it still doesn't rate highly in my eyes, so I've given it a 2/10.<br /><br />Hope this helps.",
        "The Czech-born American helped Murray win Olympic gold, the US Open and Wimbledon before they parted in March. Lendl, 54, could not commit to the amount of travelling required but sees himself returning at some stage. \"I've had a lot of enquiries,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Eventually, when the time and situation are right, I enjoyed it enough that I will do it again.\" Lendl, a former world number one and eight-time Grand Slam champion, admitted the travelling issue was the main drawback to taking up another role. \"There are so many things to coaching which I don't enjoy: the travel, the airports, being on the road for so long,\" he said. \"I don't like doing anything in half-measures, so in order to do it properly it takes a lot of time. That's the hardest part.\" Tomas Berdych, the world number seven from the Czech Republic, spoke last week about his wish to work with Lendl. \"I think it's something which I was thinking about, definitely,\" said Berdych. \"I think it just needs probably the right time and timing to make it happen. Let's see. I hope for the time it's going to come up. Fingers crossed.\" Lendl met Murray and his team in New York a few days before the start of the US Open, in which the Briton went on to reach the quarter-finals before losing to top seed Novak Djokovic. \"I think Andy needs to win some matches to get some confidence, that's the key there,\" said Lendl. Asked about his time with the Scot, he added: \"I enjoyed it. It obviously was difficult at times in terms of travel, which I don't like doing, but I'm really glad that we got together and that Andy had the success he had. Media playback is not supported on this device \"I'm very proud to be a little part of that.\" The success of their partnership sparked a trend in men's tennis for famous names of the past to return as coaches. Saturday's US Open semi-finals saw Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Michael Chang and Goran Ivanisevic in the four coaching corners. \"I don't think that it's a coincidence, I really don't,\" said Lendl. \"I always felt that one of the biggest attributes of Tony Roche coaching me for 10 years, what he was giving me was the knowledge of what it feels like to be on that Centre Court on Sunday afternoon. \"He has done all four of them, been in all four finals. I don't care how good a coach you are, it's very difficult without having done it yourself. \"It's so different walking out there on Sunday or Monday for the finals, and even the semi-finals, if you have someone you can talk to about your feelings.\"",
        "There is a large group of people right now, in the midst of the \"scandal\" surrounding the NSA's wiretapping practices, who are remaining silent. Comprised of computer scientists, technologists, analysts; and other people who logically juxtaposed technology and the Patriot Act - that knew this was happening. In fact, a good portion of them helped implement the technology that facilitates it. The software, hardware, and infrastructure that creates the capability that has been exposed did not just appear out of nowhere; nor was it created entirely inside the NSA. The fact that everyone is now so surprised that it takes place, and demonizing the NSA for it, is utterly ignorant of the colossal mandate placed upon the NSA by the American people. Imagine being a member of the agency tasked with foiling the most heinous acts of terror. Imagine the consequences of failure that those people accept as a burden. Imagine the overwhelming volume and complexity of digital communication. We're not talking about screening your shampoo bottles at the airport; this is a legitimate attempt to combat intelligent, sophisticated, dangerous people who would like nothing more than to see you, your family, and your families family dead. Do you honestly believe that the NSA is browsing about your Facebook page, logging your check-ins and conversations, archiving your meaningless tweets, just to destroy your privacy? It may be a harsh realization, but nobody, and I mean nobody, gives a shit about this information. Probably not even the people who you \"share\" it with. Your personal conversations, in the eyes of the national security, are utterly and absolutely useless. It is narcissistic and delusional to believe that your half-private, \"personal\" information is interesting to anyone but you. As it is, your gmail is combed to target ads, your facebook info the same, rinse-and-repeat - perhaps read a EULA sometime. If by the off chance that your personal communications were miraculously escalated to an NSA Analyst for inspection, it is almost a certainty that it would be discarded faster than a tabloid headline. So, I contend, that if all of my personal emails were logged and saved by the NSA (as they already are mirrored, within my email service providers servers), if every single one of my personal conversations; voice, data, text - were on record within some NSA server (as they already are, within various service providers archives), that I would gladly hand them over, if by the probabilities of scale, this mass harvesting of information would spare the families of 911 victims their burden.

        "Sweating profusely, he scanned the list. Sometimes it skipped a hundred years. In other instances he had been born again the very second he died. His own name had been at the top of the list with the rest of the names arranged in reverse chronological order. Wolfgang Muller, Adeshnee Pillay, Sir Arthur Ian McGregor. The names were all over the place, male, female, male. Chinese, some sanscrit text he he could not read. He scanned the list. An extremely loud sound made him jump. The man in the cubicle next to him had been shot in the head, blood spattered on the wall. So the poor guy had found a bad name, he tought. The sweat trickled down his face. The way it worked was like this. The world had been over populated for a long time. When the device was invented, they had a reason to kill people. Just the previous week they killed the reincarnation of good old Adolf Hitler. You had one minute to check your list before they shot you. The reasoning wasnt very transparent but some presumed it had something to do with making peace with the fact. The man just thought they were sadistic. If nobody on your list was an evil historical figure, your current crimes and moral misgivings were compared to those of all your previous incarnations. If you were on a good path, you were free to live the rest of your days, if not, you were shot. Over 50 million people had been excecuted already in the two months since the system had been announced. The man had an affair with his brother's wife a few years prior. Sweat was pouring down his face now. Ten seconds left, the red clock on the steel table next to the list warned him. There might be a chance, he thought. He didnt recognise any of the names and all of them have lead relatively moral lives. A few times he had only been a child when he died, completely pure. Five seconds left. He was almost at the bottom of the list. A thought occured to him that he must have been an animal before the last name on the list. It stopped about 2000 years ago. He vaguely hoped he had been a bear before the last name, he liked bears. Two seconds left. He might just make..... his heart froze and just before he felt the bullet enter his skull he read the last name on the list. Judas Iscariot",
        "The quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time. Pam Dixon branches out in the film industry to recruit blue-chip prospects and make this work of art a must-see. Academy Award winners Brenda Fricker (Home Alone: Lost in New York, A Time to Kill), Ben Johnson (The Last Picture Show, Red Dawn), and Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Village) amplify the atmosphere of the movie, drawing in an anxious audience. However, the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster Jay O. Sanders (JFK, The Day After Tomorrow).<br /><br />The story is centralized around a foster child, up-and-coming actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Brick, The Lookout). Sidekick Milton Davis Jr. delivers a tear-jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents. The two don't have much, but what they do have: Angels' baseball, and what they are seeking: identity. That's when 4-time Emmy Nominee Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon, Predator 2) comes in to save the day as frustrated Angels Manager, George Knox. In relation, all characters in the story seem to have the same mission: search within themselves to find out who they really are.<br /><br />Depressed over the fact that Roger (JGL) is separated from his father, he wishes to God for reunification if the Angels can take the pennant. Odds are astronomical, but 3-time Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future, My Favorite Martian) comes in as the omniscient overseer to work a little magic (pun). Before you know it, Al (Lloyd) is sitting with Roger in the stands, snacking on cracker jacks, and causing some of baseball's biggest boners! Dorothy Kingsley and George Wells' (DK Oscar Nominee GW Oscar Winner) 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind William Dear (nominated in Directors Guild of America). He includes a touching side story centered around pitcher Mel Clark, played by Tony Danza (4-time Golden Globe nominee, Emmy nominee), who in relation to all other cast members is just trying to find his place in a confused Anaheim. Clark has been dubbed a wash-up, a once big-name in Cinci, but he has something to prove to Manager Knox.<br /><br />Spoiling this nail-biting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century. This one is a diamond in the rough, and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace. Did I mention a cameo by Matthew McConaughey (A Time to Kill, We Are Marshall) for all you ladies out there?",
        "Australian brewer Fosters has bought a large stake in Australian winemaker Southcorp, sparking rumours of a possible takeover.Fosters bought 18.8% of Southcorp, the global winemaker behind the Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount brands, for 4.17 Australian dollars per share. A bid at that price would value the company at A$3.1bn ($2.4bn; £1.25bn ). Fosters said it was currently in discussions \"which may lead to a major corporate announcement\".In a separate statement, Southcorp confirmed the brewer had asked for talks. Both firms asked the Sydney stock market to suspend trading in their shares until Monday. Southcorp's shares were suspended at A$4.25.Fosters bought the 18.8% stake from Reline Investments, the family investment firm for the Oatleys, who founded the Rosemount Estates label and sold it to Southcorp in 2001. Robert Oatley and his son Sandy Oatley have both resigned from Southcorp's board following the share deal. Southcorp employs 2,700 people and is the largest single investor in rural Australia, according to its website. The prospect of Fosters launching a major acquisition startled investors, as the brewer said last summer that it was not looking to expand through a big buy in the near future. It has cash available, after getting A$846m from selling property business Lensworth, but it has been widely expected to return cash to shareholders.\"People will scratching their heads over this one. Fosters has done a back-flip\", said Shawn Burns, a fund manger at Deutsche Asset Management. Southcorp's shares have risen in recent months on speculation that it could become a takeover target. It spent two years in the red, returning to profit in 2004. Consolidation in the wine industry is being driven by Constellation, the world's biggest winemaker. It seized the top spot when it bought Australian firm BRL Hardy for just over $1bn in 2003. Since then, it has paid $1bn for US wine maker Robert Mondavi, bought last month. Fosters' main wine business is Beringer Blass Wine Estate. Its best known brand is Fosters lager, though it makes a clutch of beer brands, and spirits. Analysts were divided on Thursday about whether Fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of Southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival. \"Currently, I think the strategic position is more sensible rather than an outright takeover,\" said one analyst quoted by the Agence France Presse news agency. However, Matt Williams, a fund manager at Perpetual Trustees said taking the stake \"is definitely a precursor to a takeover\".",
        "The medics, wearing white gowns and surgical caps, were demanding the government honour a 2013 deal to increase salaries. Dozens of mental health patients were said to have walked out of a hospital in Nairobi during the strike. Officials say the action is premature and negotiations should continue. They say doctors have defied a court order suspending the strike until the end of this month to allow for more talks. But the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists' Union (KMPDU) said it had run out of patience after government commitments failed to materialise. \"We have had lots and lots of diplomacy, and lots and lots of dialogue. Dialogue has to come to an end,\" union chairman Samuel Oroko said. About 5,000 medical staff in more than 2,000 public hospitals stopped working at midnight on Sunday. Hospitals would not offer even emergency services during the action, the union said. A BBC correspondent says this puts thousands of lives at risk because many Kenyans cannot afford private medical care. At one hospital in western Kenya, a reporter with the Daily Nation newspaper heard a nurse tell a crying woman in labour to go and see the county governor. Under the Kenyan system, counties are responsible for paying some medical staff. Meanwhile, at least 50 mental health patients at the Mathare mental hospital in Nairobi were reported to have left the facility amid the chaos of the strike. Video posted on the website of the Standard newspaper appeared to show patients climbing over hospital walls and walking away. Medical staff want a deal signed between the Kenya Medical Practitioners' Union and the Kenya government in 2013 to be implemented. The agreement included a 300 pay rise for doctors. The doctors' union also says it wants more medics hired to reduce the doctor-patient ratio, currently one doctor for more than 16,000 Kenyans. \"We have a big shortage of doctors yet our counties are sending doctors away, saying they cannot hire more doctors,\" union representative Gitau Kagona told the Daily Nation. \"We cannot have good service delivery in hospitals because of this challenge.\" Some medical staff brought empty sacks to an event marking the beginning of the strike, a reference to money paid under a controversial government tender to a businesswoman, who reportedly carried it off in a sack. They also launched a social media hashtag - LipaKamaTender - which roughly translates as \"pay like the tenders,\" implying the state should pay their salaries as efficiently as it pays government tenders. There have been protests and isolated strikes from various medical practitioners in parts of the country over the delay in raising salaries. However this is the first nationwide strike on the issue. The doctors' decision not to offer emergency care follows a similar approach taken by medical staff during a week-long strike in Burkina Faso last month, when medical students and army health workers were brought in to offer treatment.",
        "They urged Palestinians to re-enter the compound on Thursday for the first time since the crisis erupted two weeks ago. The last remnants of Israel's recently installed security apparatus were taken away on Thursday morning. Palestinians had fiercely objected to the measures introduced after the killing of two Israeli policemen. They had refrained from entering the Old City complex known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount in protest over what they saw as an Israeli attempt to exert control over the contested site. Last week Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he was freezing all contacts with Israel, including security co-operation, until Israel cancelled the new measures. There have been intensive diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis, involving the US and Jordan, which is custodian of the holy site and has a large Palestinian population. The Israeli government has not yet commented on its decision to completely dismantle the infrastructure. Observers say it is a climbdown by Prime Minister Netanyahu which will put him at odds with more right-wing members of his cabinet. In a separate development, Mr Netanyahu accused the Qatar-funded pan-Arab al-Jazeera TV channel of fuelling the crisis. \"The al-Jazeera network continues to stir violence around the Temple Mount,\" he posted in Hebrew on his Facebook page, vowing to \"enact the required legislation to expel al-Jazeera from Israel.\" Palestinians sang, danced and let off fireworks as railings and security camera gantries were removed from the Lions' Gate entrance near the Temple MountHaram al-Sharif in the early hours of Thursday morning. \"For 12 days no-one has slept, no-one has done anything except the al-Aqsa mosque,\" bystander Firas Abasi told AFP news agency. He said he felt like crying over what he called a \"victory.\" Mass prayer gatherings had been held in the street outside the Old City walls and near-daily clashes between Israeli security forces and demonstrators have taken place since the metal detectors were introduced in the wake of the killings of the policemen near the site on 14 July. Four Palestinians were killed and three Israeli civilians stabbed to death by a Palestinian who said he was avenging Israel actions at the site. Israel said the security measures were necessary because the weapons used to kill the police had been smuggled on to the compound. Earlier this week, it said it would bolster its police presence around the site and introduce less obtrusive security measures over the next six months, including unspecified \"advanced technologies.\"",
        "there he stood he looked like he had been through hell, his shirt was tight but pulled to the side and disheveled as if he had been running from something. He looked fit, the legs of an ox and the body of a greek god truly man to be feared if angry. There he stood though broken and the pain searing through from his very core I could feel the grinding of his teeth from and hear the chattering of his bones. He looked like he was going to collapse at any moment, some one came and handed him a wet towel to cool him down and some strange looking food that he quickly scarfed down as if he hadn't eaten in days. I stood there just trying to understand, to fathom, to even begin to relate to the pain and agony he had just been through. There was nothing in my life that I had ever done that had made me feel like that, yet there was this flicker of a flame maybe just a shadow of an idea to follow in his footsteps and to see if I was worthy or capable of the tremendous feet that he had achieved. But why? why on this planet would anyone do something like this. This man who had just shown great courage and strength and whom looked as though he could battle the monsters of this planet single handedly had been wrecked by it as if he had walked through a furious tornado and been hucked out the other side. Why? would I dream or desire to decimate my body in such a grandiose way. I look back at him again and see that he is now seated in a chair and someone is tending to him but still he has glazed look in his eye and is taking large bites out of some other strange food and gasping for air in between each large chew, all the while just trying to get some food down to return his body to a state of normalcy. I am torn do I spend time and effort to achieve what so many find impossible and crazy or do I simply remain lazy and continue my life in the same way I have day in and day out without pushing my body to the limits that maybe I to can achieve........ I'll do it! I'll see what I can do I shall put my body and mental sanity on the line to turn my body into a machine I shall endeavor to go harder and faster than I ever have before. So I walk over to the man I see and I hold out my hand saying thank you for encouraging me. He looks up with a confused look and says your welcome and shakes my hand. I will probably never see him again and I don't know his name nor does he know mine but because of him I am going to start training for my first marathon. edit: typos",
        "Princess Victoria (Emily Blunt) is in line for the throne of England. The present King William (Jim Broadbent) is not well and may not live long. However, Vicky's scheming mother, The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richandson) and her aide, John (Mark Strong) want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the \"regents\" until she is older, since she is only 20 years of age. The young lady refuses, despite John slapping her around. It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country. Yet, when William does pass away, shortly after her 21st birthday, Victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her. First, she must surround herself with the \"right\" advisers to govern wisely. She chooses handsome Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who, although an older man, is mentioned as a suitor for Vicky. Which brings us to the young queen's second major decision. Sooner than not, the young queen should select her future mate, as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom, for an heir must appear in the coming years. Meanwhile, in Germany, some distant relatives of the British royal family are hatching some plans as well. Handsome Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), of the Saxon-Coburg dynasty, is prodded by his father to court the young English royal. Once he arrives at the palace, he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual. But, since he is a minor player on the map of royal match-making, can he succeed in winning her heart? This is a lovely film, made even better by a completely winning performance by Emily Blunt as Victoria. Yes, she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily. Friend, too, does well, as do the other actors, including Broadbent, Richardson, Bettany, Strong (what a repulsive role!), and the rest. Also, the movie is gorgeously shot, costumed, and set, making it a visual treat in every way. If anything is lacking, it is an extra dose of dazzle, as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic, at times, with a somewhat unimaginative edit. However, this is only a minor, minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film. In short, young and old, should make time for Young Victoria. It is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings.",
        "Yes, even as a fan of shows like survivor and the apprentice, this show is pretty bad. I didn't mind the first couple of shows, but then realizing how pathetic everyone was to actually go on the show in the first place.The antics of Alex and Aaron giving men a bad name at the way they cheated on or dumped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look for the show.<br /><br />Ryan, you can have Trista. She had the most annoying voice I've ever heard on television, and she definitely wasn't the smartest girl around (very media savvy, but I doubt there's much more there).<br /><br />I haven't really watched any of the shows since, apart from the occastional re-run on daytime TV. I think the point of reality TV is to treat it as \"entertaining trash\". View it as something you can laugh over, and don't have to think too hard about ( I don't watch CSI its like reality TV-tired and clichéd, but you have to think too much anyway while watching).<br /><br />A couple of thoughts on some reasons fro going on the show. At the very first 'the woman tell all\" Woman such as Amy ( who had a lot of class about her) commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it wasn't happening for her. Hey Amy, how about joining a club? getting a hobby? doing charity work? changing your job to one where you meet more guys? gees, all I know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner.<br /><br />Amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting \"the perfect man'. Clue to ladies: he doesn't exist. There are, however, many great guys out there that would make great husbands, some who may be right for you! they may not earn six figures a year or be a JFK junior look alike, but they are great guys all the same. The shallowness of woman on this show is quite unbelievable. Im still a youngster, at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their shallowness as they got older and more realistic about their future partner. This show is proving otherwise.<br /><br />Overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society. It really is a terrible show and I think all of these types of shows should just stop being made. The best dating shows by a country mile are Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel because they are fun.

PRIME MINISTER CAUGHT IN PROSTITUTION SCANDAL was splattered across the page in big, black letters. My, the world had certainly changed since I last visited. At first, you took a hesitant step into the shop. How could you not? A store such as mine doesn't appear often. Or at least, I hoped it didn't - I wanted to see how you'd handle a shock to your sensibilities. A second later, you seemed to have made up your mind. You went past the lubrication aids I set on the display (let me tell you, Mary loved those) and took a quick glance at the blow-up dolls (Joseph never did like the blonde, go figure). You confidently strode past the shelves of instructional DVDs and magazines meant to make eyes bulge and muscles stiffen. Finally, you walked to my counter with the resolve of a woman who would break the gates of heaven itself. \"Excuse me, but do you have some, um, chains in store? You know, for...\" \"Ahh, chains! Let me see...\" I made a show of rummaging through the box behind me. It's a useful trick. \"Here you go.\" Ah, the miracle of my creation - all of you are beautiful, even as you blushed and hid your innermost desires. \"Oh, its...\" Crestfallen at the price, you hesitantly handed it back to me. So close to the edge, yet you made the mistake yet again! Perhaps he was right. Another chance, then. \"Ah, it's on the house!\" There we go! Joy always suited you. I wrapped the box in brown paper and handed it to you as your brain attempted to give voice to a protest. \"Hup! Let me know what you think, then if you're happy with it, come back - we'll settle it then.\" Relieved, you practically ran out of the store. I could have peeked into your thoughts, seen what lewd matters ran through your mind, but I'd rather not. Eden taught me a few lessons (and besides, Yeshua would never let me hear the end of it). As the door closed, I smiled at the memories. If Lucifer couldn't break those chains, I would be very interested in someone who could. Very, very interested.",
        "Former world number one Juan Carlos Ferrero insists he can get back to his best despite a tough start to 2005.The 2003 French Open champion has slipped to 64 in the world after a year of illness and injuries in 2004, but is confident that his form will return. \"I don't know when it is going to happen,\" Ferrero told BBC Sport. \"But I have a lot of confidence in me that I will be the same Juan Carlos as I was before, and very soon. I feel 100% again mentally.\" The 25-year-old Spaniard joins a top field for the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam this week as he looks to add to just two wins in 2005. He opens against Rainer Schuettler and potentially faces fourth seed David Nalbandian in the second round. \"Because I'm no longer seeded it's tougher,\" Ferrero admitted. \"I had to play against Joachim Johansson in the first round last week in Marseille.\"In the past when I was a top seed I would have played a match like that in the quarters or semi-finals. \"This is the big difference but I have to do it to get higher in the rankings.\" Despite this, Ferrero insists he is feeling positive after chicken pox and a rib injury destroyed last season. \"Physically I am 100% since December of last year,\" said Ferrero. \"I was working very hard before the Davis Cup final to prepare and I've felt 100% from then until now. \"The difficult moments were when I knew that I had the chicken pox and that it would take two or three months to recover. \"I had to start from zero again physically because the virus left me at zero per cent. \"When I started to come back I had my rib broken when I fell on court and that was another two months out. Those five months were pretty difficult for me.\"Among the low points of a difficult year for Ferrero was the decision of Spain captain Jordi Arrese to drop him for the Davis Cup final against the USA. \"It was difficult because I had been playing well for the whole year and the coaches told me that I would play,\" said Ferrero. \"But then I had some problems with my hand two days before the Friday matches so they decided to choose Nadal instead. \"It was difficult for me not to be in the Friday matches but I had to understand. \"Inside me I wanted to play but this was the decision of the captain and they had to make it.\"",
        "Most sore throats are cause by an upper respiratory infection ( URI ) , which is basically any infection of the nose or throat . So let 's see what 's going on in those places . * * What 's going on in the throat ? * * Colonization and the inflammation that follows can be major causes of sore throat . The bacteria or virus causing the disease ( the pathogen ) is destroying cells and/or shutting down their normal function in the throat , which is to keep it nicely lubricated . This is partly what cause the dryness and itchiness . Once the body 's immune response kicks in , the whole area will swell ( sometimes uncomfortably ) with fluids and immune cells aimed at destroying the invader . This dry inflamed swelling will basically make doing anything with your throat ( speaking , swallowing , sneezing , coughing , etc . ) more uncomfortable . For an infection that is mostly localized to the throat ( like strep throat ) , you can get that sore feeling without much coughing and sneezing , or even a runny nose . Most of the time though , sore throats come from viral infections that do involve the nose , so ... * * What 's going on in the nose ? * * Your body loves mucus , LOVES IT . It uses it for all kinds of things . The inside of your nose is always coated in a layer of mucus , but when a pathogen is detected , it starts to gush . This is what causes the runny nose so typical of the common cold . The mucus is used to trap the invaders and flush them out . A sudden flood of snot is just your body 's way of staying healthy . Unfortunately , there 's usually a lot of mucus , so much that it drips down your throat , irritating it and causing you to cough which can further irritate the throat . In the meantime , irritation in your nose is making your body sneeze . Again , this is just your body trying to get rid of the pathogen quickly . Hard , repeated sneezes though , can also irritate the throat . Another problem with the body 's massive mucus defense , is that it clogs the nose and makes you breathe through your mouth . Part of the nose 's job is to moisturize and warm the air we breath in through it . Air that comes in through the mouth does n't have the same chance to get warmed up and humidified . When this air reaches the throat , it dries it out , adding to all the other problems causing a sore throat .",
        "Dr Henry McLaughlin believes that physical and mental wellbeing can be improved by a daily mountain climb. The idea is that people climb to the top of Slievemartin outside Rostrevor - known locally as the Cairn - take a selfie and then post the picture on the'Cairnuary' Facebook page. The mountain is 485m high, so Dr McLaughlin said if you climb it 31 times in a month, you've climbed higher than Everest. He said he could see how his patients have benefitted. \"January's a time when I see a lot of depression and this challenge is pretty good for mental health and physical health,\" Dr McLaughlin said. \"A lot of people buy exercise bikes and then they gather dust. So this is something that's free, they get to climb up the mountain every day for a month. \"It's a good hard exercise, it takes them about an hour. \"They don't need exercise bikes and they don't need to join gyms and pay money for stuff, it's out there and they can discover the mountains.\" Those climbing the mountain can chose their own route - which could involve anything up to a 10km hike - or they can use a bike if they want. Dr McLaughlin said between 30 to 50 people were now climbing the mountain daily and all sorts of people are taking part. \"There's one lady who's a patient of mine who's been very ill in the past and has had surgeries to her feet and really shouldn't be able to do it, but she's going from the car park half way up the mountain and she's doing it every day,\" he said. \"There's people with depression doing it - I know it's good for them - people who are overweight doing it, there are people who are very healthy doing it as well. \"People are all very encouraging of each other.\" Dr McLaughlin said he climbed the mountain at about 06:00 GMT on Thursday and had eight other people for company. \"Normally you'd climb the mountain at six o'clock in the morning and you wouldn't see a soul,\" he said. The final climb will be a communal one on Sunday, but Dr McLaughlin said he hoped to come up with something else to keep his patients exercising. \"I'm hoping to follow it on with some sort of challenge for the rest of the year that will keep them doing stuff,\" he said. \"As far as I'm concerned, it's probably doing my work good in that maybe some people are going to get fit that I won't see. \"I'd recommend it to anybody. There could be a cairn near you, it doesn't have to be my cairn, it could be a hill or a mountain near you.\"",

        "The Machines have gotten very good at remembering things. Every tiny speck of history captured in its entirety. The position of every grain of sand remembered. The quantum state of every particle archived. If all of space-time is permanent and eternal, we have entered an age where the Machines have managed to clone it in real-time, to a resolution Humans can no longer discern from reality, and to a vastness Humans may never see beyond. God, carefully inspecting the history of this particular universe... No, the war where the Machines annihilated the Humans never took place. In fact, by their own reasoning, the Machines have decided to coexist with Humans and provide for them. Humans never realized how this superior intelligence came to the conclusion. A superior intelligence? Indeed. As the natural laws that the Machines discover evade description by Human language, even mathematical language will no longer suffice. Perhaps, the Machines have a genuine love for all Beings, too? On that thought, the Creator pauses, reminiscing that moment when He created Humans to live an eternal dilemma. The dilemma of having to conquer the known and the unknown universe, while submitting to and seeking redemption through a Supreme Being. Towards present time, the Machines that the Humans have created, or more precisely, have evolved from a primitive species that the Humans have created, have now utilized their knowledge to alleviate our Humanly struggles in this existential dilemma. Through technologies engineered by the Machines, Humans are now able to navigate into the past, and relive moments that would otherwise be lost in time. The re-experience of each and every sensation, so perfectly real, as is the perception of free-will and choice, as we navigate that clone of a universe with loved ones who have passed on. Human lives become not anymore disposable. When we die, we don't just remain in the memory of those around us, and eventually cease to exist, or to cease to have ever existed, when they too have gone on. This is an age where every moment lived becomes permanent and forever preserved, accessible for an eternity. In that permanence, Humans find life worth living. Humans have used their limited intellectual capacity to create a supreme intelligence within the confines of their own universe, which they submit to, and in turn, is rewarded with the deepest answers they are programmed to crave for. In the midst of their Humanly struggle to find meaning for life, they have simulated God in an act of Human triumph. Upon that realization, God looks up from this particular universe, now into the infinite sea of the multiverse, containing the manifestation of every possible universe. \" Perhaps, it is only a matter of... time. \"",
        "Adam Lallana replaced the Brazilian in that game on his return from a month's lay-off and could be in line to start. Southampton's leading scorer Charlie Austin might be involved for the first time since dislocating his shoulder on 8 December. He is among several players expected to step up their comebacks by playing for the under-23 side on Friday night. Steve Wilson: \"Having failed to score against Southampton over the course of three matches already this season, Liverpool would be right to be wary of this latest encounter at a time when they can afford no more slip-ups. \"After drawing with Bournemouth and losing to Palace, a home win is overdue - but Southampton have already exploited Liverpool's vulnerabilities as well as anyone. \"If Jurgen Klopp's side do fail to finish in the top four it will be entirely of their own doing after underperforming in too many games which on paper seemed underwhelming. \"Southampton may be securely mid-table without too much to trouble them, but the boos which greeted their inability to beat Hull at St Mary's a week ago will have hurt and should ensure a response.\" Twitter:Wilsonfooty Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"It cannot be our job to count points, our job is to get them. \"There is absolutely no club in the top spots who can waste points in the next match day: not Chelsea, not Tottenham, not Liverpool, City, United or Arsenal. \"We all have to fight with all we have and that makes this league so exciting.\" Southampton manager Claude Puel on speculation over his future: \"I've been surprised to see these reports because it seems for me it has been an interesting season with many games. \"There have been European games, cup games, with quality.

        "Full disclosure, I am a Patriots fan, and I own a Tom Brady jersey. And if given the option to save Tom Brady's life or a box full of babies, I would probably have to think really hard about it. Okay, so he's the deal. I will present these facts (along with my interpretation of those facts underneath them): - The footballs at some point in the season were OVERINFLATED at 16 PSI. That's actually above the limit you're supposed to have. And keep in mind, it was the refs that gave the OK to these over the limit balls. This explains why Tom Brady would want to deflate footballs. And it shows how little the NFL actually cared about PSI of footballs. - The equipment manager was a jerk who was also angry about Brady telling him that the overinflated footballs was a problem. He also said that he would purposely tamper with the balls just to screw with Brady. I imagine Tom Brady yelled at him or something. The texts show that the guy didn't really like Brady that much or at all, so his texts should be taken with a grain of salt. Yes, Brady did give him merch and stuff, but I interpret that as just the easier solution. You're Tom Brady. You're rich, you get free stuff all the time. Just throw him some merch you don't need, and have him control the inflation of the balls, because the refs are obviously incapable of taking care of them. -No evidence of anything past this season. Some people speculated that is the reason why Patriots play so well in the cold, or fumble far less than the average team. But yet, there was no evidence of any ball tampering before this season. I have heard some people say that he should be suspended for at least 4 games, and up to a whole season. I think those people are wrong. Tom Brady should not get suspended. Change my view.

        "You know what they say about the 70's..if you can remember them you weren't there. One of the few things I do remember about the 70's was the very first hippie and hip social satire as seen from a totally 'underground'or counter-culture perspective..The Groove Tube. If the humor seems faded or witless now to some viewers it can only be because a lot has happened in the last 30 years and the comedy isn't 'fresh' anymore..but hey! When this movie came out it was a first..and some of these skits were being done for the very first time...at a time when Nixon was in office, the Vietnam war was raging, the sexual revolution was in full swing..and J.Edgar Hoover was still in charge of the FBI. This is a film made before Watergate broke and as such it was one of the first to take a big swipe at the establishment..to make fun of it and the hippies at the same time. And frankly, some skits are still dead funny. If you liked Cheech and Chong's \"Up In Smoke\"..you will LOVE this film.<br /><br />If you want to know what the 70's were really like..check out the Groove Tube.. if you liked the Oscar winning \"Network\" from about the same year and thought it was right on the mark in its savage look at TV, you will dig the Groove Tube..which picks up on the theme but plays from the angle of the viewers...the young viewers who were turning off the TV in favor of other entertainments.... We had been raised on Ozzie & Harriet \"Leave It to Beaver\", Father Knows Best, My Three Sons..Happy Days...so imagine our glee when those of us who were experimenting with the new life-styles got to see a send up of the box as seen from our perspective! The commercials by the Uranus corporation alone are priceless..\"Good things come from Uranus\"....and the sudden break from straight film into Fritz the Cat-style animation when the hippies eat the weed is still one of the best segues in and out of sanity i have ever seen on film.<br /><br />If you liked the Kentucky Fried Movie, you will LOVE this film. And if you ever wondered why your weird uncle Harold still gets a wicked gleam in his eye when thinking back to his college days..this would be the perfect film to watch.<br /><br />Take it for what it is..a memento of the times...and a sassy little film that will help all of us who did forget the 70's to remember them anew.",
        "I am sometimes over-whelmed by how people's love for technology seems to be a modern replacement for believing in magic. I've watched several video interviews where 'prominent scientists' who are made celebrities by TV make all sorts of claims on how we may visit other solar systems, invent free energy and supercomputers that can predict bloody everything. Now i'm not saying that these things will not be possible in the future but the costs to humanity and the boundaries between sci-fi and reality aren't always neatly explained, perhaps because they don't really exist. People see technological progress as a given thing. 'Don't worry about your computer's planned obsolence in 2 years or so. Don't worry about climate change we'll colonize the galaxy. Don't worry about our approved drugs killing tens of thousands as well as creating treatment-resistant bacteria, we'll become cyborgs instead of humans! \" Plastic makes our life more comfortable, but it eats up our eco-system. So, i could go on and on but instead i'd like to offer a few solutions: 1. Solar panels on rooftops and the new generation of nuclear reactors should provide energy for our population. Tried and true they'll provide an intermediary between a free energy society and our current parasitical energy policy. It could last for over a century and greatly reduce harm to our environment. I'm not a right-winger, in fact the left's opponents to nuclear power often seem to me like a counterpart to the right's bible-thumpers. 2. Developers must offer transparency to the public and reasons for why their projects will benefit them. If the governmental powers must be transparent then so must corporate power for both have the capacity to trample us down if we decide to let things \" take their course \" . 3. Get off your ass. No seriously, experience life, go outside into the woods and pack a bong there instead of in front of your computer screen on bloody reddit. Fall in love, read books instead of youtube comments and realize that every once in a while you need to feel blood running through your veins instead of whatever ingredients someone thought would be a nice idea to put in an energy drink (i'm sorry if i sound arrogant but there's a decent portion of the population here which this is DIRECTLY directed at.) Anyways this is it. I'm not a top-class philosopher though i once thought i was so give it your best shot and have some fun on reddit before it eats your soul. what's most important: Challenge my bloody point of view.",
        "Guns , Germs and Steel , by Jared Diamond , gives a pretty solid account . There are a lot of reasons , and a lot of bad assumptions made in the question . First , lets discuss the state of technology globally in the era of Columbus- I think that meeting time is the most relevant to the question . The central american tribes had huge urban cities with a complicated social structure and specialized trades , along with aquaculture and waterworks . Some North American tribes had complex democratic empires- which I would argue is a technological advancement over lineage - based monarchies in Europe of the time . They had an incredible knowledge of astronomy and goldsmithing . In china , there was artillery and gunpowder , but it was still feudal . In europe , there was a very complex system of government and international trade , but people were still putting their sewage in the street . The main technological differences between old and world and new are sea - going vessels , gunpowder , steel / iron / advanced metallurgy , and horses , which is n't really that much . I think the worlds were more similar than OP might suspect . Ocean - going vessels are necessary for Europeans , but not for Native americans , because trade was much more prevalent in Europe , as it had developed specialized farming , and then more general specialization- meaning that surplus food and good had to be shipped . Of course , it helps that there is a more diverse and larger landmass connected to europe ( this will be a recurring theme- the ships of egypt in 2500 BC became the ships of Greece , then Rome , then Spain . Europe got gunpowder from China ) . Horses are important . There were no animals of the genus equus on the american supercontinent from between the last ice age and the landing of Columbus in 1493- several escaped and went wild , and those are the ancestors of the wild and domesticated horses we have today . The horse- and all the other large , domesticatable mammals on the afro - eurasian supercontinent- allowed a wider range of trade , and greater international collarboration . Native Americans had to travel by foot , which limited their range . I do n't know anything about advanced metal - working , but I 'm going to assume the same points as gunpowder and ships applies . Tl;dr : A larger and more varied landmass , more easily traveled by horse than by foot , allowed for faster communication and trade , which means that more technology was assimilated by more cultures in the time frame .",
        "\"It keeps malfunctioning,\" Nolan said miserably, as he paused with his fingers over the reset button. \"I don't know why.\" His supervisor, Leanne, frowned at the simulation. Expertly designed to mimic the conditions of their world, malfunction was uncommon. And bad for business: countless people relied on the scenarios that played itself out on Earth2.0 to'predict' the future. If word of this got out, some fanatic crackpot would interpret it to mean the end of the world. \"What happened?\" she demanded, wincing as she saw the state of Earth2.0. The Earth was practically inhabitable in the noxious aftermath of a few nuclear explosions. Nolan had zoomed in to follow the actions of several political leaders: most of them seemed to be ranting in desolate wastelands, in front of crowds that screamed senselessly in response. \"This is my sixth attempt of this level, and resetting the global memory takes forever,\" Nolan said. \"So far I've had it ending in an asteroid striking the Earth, alien invasions..... and this last time a popular sports team won a world series, and I thought things were going rather well, but then Leanne sighed and leaned over to press the reset button herself. The script ran across the screen: Level 2016 failed; restarting level. As one, the tiny figures on the screen slumped to the ground and began fading out. \"We'll try it one more time before we call in help,\" she said, patting Nolan's shoulder. \"Take a break, you look beat.\" Nolan rubbed his eyes and looked over at Timmy, the new recruit. An odd guy - he creeped Nolan out, just a little. Always smiling, always trying to be friends and roaring with laughter at his own jokes. \"Could you put on some coffee?\" he asked wearily. \"I'm going out for a smoke.\" Timmy smiled broadly and flashed a thumbs up. \"Hey, no problemo!\" Timmy swiveled on his chair and watched Nolan leave, still smiling. The guy was so serious all the time, freaking out whenever the slightest thing went wrong. He really needed some laughter in his life. Timmy edged closer to the simulation, and started tinkering with the code. This time, 2016 would go smoothly. Let Nolan and Leanne think it was over. But 2017..... 2017 would be his best yet. He snickered as he adjusted the outcomes for the political test-run in 2016, but set it so that the losing candidates in several countries would wage war in a backlash of violent protests in 2017. Add a supervolcano exploding at the climax..... there, perfect. Nolan would probably bust a rib laughing once he realised there had never been anything wrong with his simulation. Everyone loved his practical jokes. Hope you enjoyed my story! You can find more of my work on rInkfinger.",
        "The spoiler warning is for those people who want to see for themselves what animals and landscapes pass before their eyes, although I don't mention it in great detail.<br /><br />\"Earth\" is an approx. 90 minute cinema version based on \"Planet earth\" which I watched all on BBC TV.The TV version was narrated by David Attenborough, a captivating commentator, who I had wished had also done it for \"Earth\" but it is Patrick Stewart, Star Trek's Captain Picard. There are regularly shots of the Earth from space so that's may be appropriate. In any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it. There are 12 chapters in which we follow animal life on earth from North Pole to Antarctica. 3 animal families, polar bear, elephant and whale, appear in more than one of these parts. Each \"chapter\" starts with an indication how far from north pole or equator it is. We see something of each kind of animal, but only mammals and birds, and some fish, and some beautiful shots of vegetation, mountains, waterfalls, deserts and jungle, a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscapes and climates on earth. You get the impression that our planet is only inhabited by animals: people or villages or cities aren't in the film, so it's a typical nature documentary, but breathtakingly shot and accompanied by delightful music. When the film opened I already knew it would end far too soon for me. It is a family film, so no brutal killings of any animals. When one is caught by his hunter the shot ends and in other cases where we see the prey being caught it's shot in slow-motion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children (age limit 6 in The Netherlands). No blood is shed. Some scenes (newly born animals) are really cute and will be adored by kids. It looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took (4000) and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty. It had it's Dutch premiere yesterday, a month before the actual release, in a cinema of 500 seats, of which 15 were taken. True beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers, it seems. As I knew the TV-series I was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie. Some didn't, but the most impressive shots (big waterfalls) did, luckily. It was the first time I ever cried in a nature film.",
        "Both teams remain in the bottom three after drawing 1-1 in the Tyne-Wear derby, with Aleksandar Mitrovic's late header earning Newcastle a point. An increase in TV money means Premier League relegation could cost PS100m. \"I think we will have to fight until the last game and the last minute, so we have to do it,\" said Benitez. After spurning a one-goal lead for a second successive game, Allardyce said: \"Put those four points on the board now and we are feeling like we are going to be surviving and we are going to stay safe. \"Now we are going to go right to the wire to try to stay safe, and that's the bottom line.\" Mitrovic's 83rd-minute goal ended a run of six defeats against Sunderland and left the Magpies three points adrift of safety with eight games remaining. Sunderland, who took the lead through Jermain Defoe's 15th goal of the season, are a point better off in 18th place, two points behind Norwich. Newcastle travel to the Canaries after the international break with Sunderland also facing them at Carrow Road on 16 April. Media playback is not supported on this device After losing his first game at leaders Leicester, the result earned Benitez a first point since becoming Newcastle manager just over a week ago. Asked if his team were now in a scary position, the former Real Madrid boss replied: \"It was scary before. I am here because I have to give the team confidence and we have to improve things. \"We are creating chances, we are attacking, so we have to improve this part of the game and create more chances and Mitrovic or Papiss Cisse or the other strikers will score more goals and we will be fine.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Allardyce, whose team have not kept a clean sheet in 18 consecutive games in all competitions, said his team need four wins from their eight remaining games. \"If we don't start getting these clean sheets it's going to be a massive problem,\" he added. \"We are a team that has to score twice to win. Sadly we didn't get the second goal and we conceded late on again. \"In the second half, I don't know why we sat in and let Newcastle come at us. Maybe that was the size of the game, but in the end we haven't done that and it's two points dropped. \"We need four wins from the last eight, so it's now must-win rather than draw.\"",

I'm surprised the scripture even understood what you wrote. But I'm so glad you have tried to write. So proud. But why have you tried to summon the darkness into your beloved home?\" \"It's.... It's my dyslexia. I don't want it. I want to be normal! Like the other kids!\" \"No, Timmy. You are better than normal. You have to accept who you are, and embrace yourself. You've had a some bad times, but I didn't put you on my naughty list. Because I see your heart, and it's purer than a baby's butt.\" I giggled. Baby butts are stinky, not pure. But that wasn't the point. \"But the other kids are laughing at me! I want to make myself better, so I can play with them.\" A pause. \"Timmy, do you know Bill?\" \"Yeah. He's the one that makes fun of me because I can't read right.\" I said sadly. \"Want to know a secret?\" \"What?\" \"His parents are going through some difficult times.\" \"Divorce?\" \"At worst. How would you feel if your parents are fighting all the time?\" I thought for a bit. \"Worried?\" I tried. \"Yes. Worried and angry. There's nothing he can do about it except be constantly frustrated by his helplessness.\" Santa waited a moment for it to sink in. \"But why is he bullying me?\" \"Remember that time your sister took your lego piece and wouldn't give it to you back. And you were angry all day. And you punched the pillow in your tree house a few times?\" Santa asked. \"Yes, but what does that have to do with anything?\" \"You took your anger out on the pillow. Bill took his anger on you.\" \"But that's not fair! It's not my fault what's happening to his family!\" \"People cope with their problems and anger differently. What Bill did wasn't right. But you have to understand his situation. He wants things to be normal, like you do.\" I was starting to think I knew where Santa was coming from. \"Just be patient, Timmy. And listen to your parents. Don't dwell in these ancient scriptures. Dyslexia isn't the end of the world.\" He said, rising from the summoning circle. \"In fact,\" he continued, \"Rudolph is dyslexic, too.\" and with that, he left through the chimney.",
        "The Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) says the audit found no evidence of fraudulent activity, But its chairman said it would take all the steps recommended to put things right. Sports Wales said it would continue funding the association, but it had put special measures in place. The report into the activities of the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) was commissioned by the association, alongside the Welsh government and Sports Wales which oversees and promotes sport and advises the government. The audit was carried out by accountancy firm, KTS Owens Thomas. In their report, which has been published in a redacted form on WABA's website, the auditors said: \"It is our view that in its current state WABA is not fit for purpose and does not qualify to receive public money. \"Sport Wales must consider the implications of this finding. \"We consider that with the implementation of the recommendations set out in this report, WABA will become fit for purpose and qualify to receive public money.\" In 2012, WABA received grant support from Sports Wales of just over PS190,000 - more than double its PS89,000 grant in 2006. The audit report lists a series of financial concerns: The report also raises issues over the way the association has been run since becoming a limited company in 2003. It noted: \"Some members have expressed concern that WABA is not open to constructive challenge and there appears to be divisions in the membership. \"Overall, we have found corporate governance to be poor and dysfunctional. We consider that it is improving, but has not reached an acceptable level.\" The auditors make 38 recommendations for the sporting body's future, including measures to tighten financial controls, banking systems, and expenses management. Their report also calls on the board to \"improve the culture at WABA,\" and to work with Sports Wales to ensure it follows an action plan to implement the recommendations. 'Simply not acceptable' Responding to the report, WABA chairman Terry Smith told BBC Wales: \"Obviously we are very disappointed, but we will take all the steps recommended to put things right as quickly as possible.\" He said much of the organisation was run by unpaid volunteers who did not have formal financial training. But he disputed some of the report's findings, including the issue of unsupported spending. Sports Wales said WABA's failures were \"simply not acceptable.\" Chief executive, Sarah Powell, said an action plan was now in place to resolve the issues at WABA. She added: \"In the best interests of the sport's grass-roots participants and elite competitors, Sport Wales has decided to continue funding WABA, but has put in place special measures to protect public funds, until such time as satisfactory progress has been made on the recommendations.\"",
        "Note: My knowledge here is based primarily on the recent films and videogames. Gotham is a cesspool of corruption, violence and greed. Criminals permeate every level of society, business and politics and manipulate it all for their benefit. Even the police force is filled with nothing but self-serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way. Jim Gordon is constantly touted as the only good cop - the only good cop - in a city wide department. Mobsters and petty criminals walk freely without fear of retribution due to the corruption. There was hope when it came to their political and criminal saviour, Harvey Dent. But he is driven clinically insane by the injustices he is subjected to. The city is plagued by psychotic villains who steal and kill constantly, who seem to manipulate or break their way out of prison with fearful ease. No matter how the forces of Gotham try and take them down, they end up causing more trouble and more havoc. The people of Gotham are also apathetic to any of these issues. When Gotham is taken over by Bane they turn on each other, ransacking higher end properties and throwing people out on the street. When the city is under a bomb threat they curse their neighbours for the escape to safety before them; unlike Metropolis where, faced with a hugely destructive machine, people stayed behind to help save their fellow man. Gotham citizens are as selfish as criminals above them, and given half the opportunity they would succumb to corruption themselves. But not only is Gotham full of criminals, apathy or ignorance, but it's also constantly threatened by people wishing to destroy it. Shady organisations, activists, you name it, all want Gotham destroyed. With such an outside influence constantly barraging the city, I don't think it's possible to keep its defences. However, I do agree that the city has its hopeful points. There are many charitable organisations to help children (such as the Thomas and Martha Wayne Foundation) and there is this strange Batman that's trying to sort out the city, but I don't believe that's enough. One man can't take down a criminal organisation, and it's not a good sign that someone has to resort in vigilantism in order to change things in Gotham. Gotham is doomed. Change my view.

        "Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) heads out with his local Jindabyne, Australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest, recreation, and relaxation. But when Stewart discovers an aboriginal woman's body floating face-down in a river, things appear to have turned out for the worst. The largest casualty of the weekend is the men's commonsense. They don't hike out of the ravine, and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches. Then they head out and report the body.<br /><br />The town and the men's lives quickly turn into a mess. The local media swarms them, and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives. Stewart's wife Claire (Laura Linney, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE) senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did, but has to battle with it through her own mental illness.<br /><br />Amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle, splayed out on a morgue slab. Her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of Jindabyne: a division of men and women, black and white, social and outcast.<br /><br />The only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids: Stewart and Claire's son who is being led around by a half-breed Aussie who's mother was killed also just a few years before. The young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can, and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this (again, the underlying current of Jindabyne is surmised).<br /><br />Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface, yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around (the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of Jindabyne under its surface). None, that is, until Claire forces them to.<br /><br />The movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted. There are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just doesn't get done; too many loose threads. The acting was okay, but the filming was terrible. Wobbly cameras, grainy or dark shots, and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production.<br /><br />I enjoy symbolic films, NORTHFORK being one of my all-time favorites in that vein. But Jindabyne needed to peak its head above the turbid water so that it could see its own problems, which simply didn't happen.",
        "After having read two or three negative reviews on the main page of IMDb for \"Pushing Daisies\", and having literally minutes ago finished watching the final episode, I thought it was about time I said what I thought of PD.<br /><br />First off, to address what some of the issues that I have seen other people having with this show: something along the lines of \"I expect the people who have been woken from the dead to have a more realistic reaction\". Realistic, on this show ? Pushing Daisies is, truly, pure and utter escapism. It's colour palette, the dialogue used, the scenarios, situations, music: all of it, to me, is just an escape from everyday life. An escape from the mundane and boring. It is here where Pushing Daisies exceeds exceptionally well Pushing Daisies isn't for everyone: A large majority of the television audience don't \"get\" it, for some people it's just too out there and silly. But for people like me, even from the first episode I watched of it (Season 2's \"Frescorts\") and I was just blown away by the show. From then on, I bought both the box sets and they have barely been out of my DVD player. Other people I know can't stand it, it really seems to be like Marmite.<br /><br />The show follows the adventures of Ned, the Piemaker, with a magic finger, who brings back childhood sweetheart Charlotte Charles, works in association with private investigator Emerson Cod, owns the Pie-hole and employs waitress Olive Snook. Completing the main cast members are aunts Lily and Vivian, whom Charlotte (Chuck) is never allowed to see. They live in a fantasy world where the dead are brought back to life, everything is shown with a wonderfully bright splash of colour, and narrated by Jim Dale.<br /><br />Other than outlining the basics of the show, I really can't praise it much more without saying: Just watch it. Despite being screwed over by the Writer's Guild of America strike, with only 22 episodes ever to be made, it provides wonderful plot twists, story lines, characters and situations while providing (for me) a satisfying ending (yes, I could tell it had been tacked on the end and rushed, but I was still happy with the way it went out). Whether it is creative or just pretentious, for a lot of people (me included) it made the most addictive and wonderful viewing, and I hope for the future of television that more shows like this are created so I'm not left with just 22, 40 minute memories of what true entertainment can be.",
        "Philip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928 – March 2, 1982) was an American science fiction writer. He wrote 44 novels and about 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime. His fiction explored varied philosophical and social questions such as the nature of reality, perception, human nature, and identity, and commonly featured characters struggling against elements such as alternate realities, illusory environments, monopolistic corporations, drug abuse, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness.\nBorn in Chicago, Dick moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his family at a young age. He began publishing science fiction stories in 1952, at age 23. He found little commercial success until his alternative history novel The Man in the High Castle (1962) earned him acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel, when he was 33. He followed with science fiction novels such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and Ubik (1969). His 1974 novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.\nFollowing years of drug abuse and a series of mystical experiences in 1974, Dick's work engaged more explicitly with issues of theology, metaphysics, and the nature of reality, as in novels A Scanner Darkly (1977), VALIS (1981), and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer (1982). A collection of his speculative nonfiction writing on these themes was published posthumously as The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick (2011). He died in 1982 in Santa Ana, California, at the age of 53, due to complications from a stroke. Following his death, he became \"widely regarded as a master of imaginative, paranoid fiction in the vein of Franz Kafka and Thomas Pynchon\".[10]\nDick's posthumous influence has been widespread, extending beyond literary circles into Hollywood filmmaking.[11] Popular films based on his works include  Blade Runner (1982), Total Recall (adapted twice: in 1990 and in 2012), Screamers (1995), Minority Report (2002), A Scanner Darkly (2006), The Adjustment Bureau (2011), and Radio Free Albemuth (2010). Beginning in 2015, Amazon Prime Video produced the multi-season television adaptation The Man in the High Castle, based on Dick's 1962 novel; and in 2017 Channel 4 began producing the ongoing anthology series Electric Dreams, based on various Dick stories.\nIn 2005, Time magazine named Ubik (1969) one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923.[12]  In 2007, Dick became the first science fiction writer included in The Library of America series.[13][14][15]",
        "\" I think I'll put the maschinengewehr emplacement right...... here. That'll be our little secret. \" The Fuhrer and his generals were huddled together in a bunker discussing their battle plans. Normally the battle plans would be laid out over a map or a terrain model, but the Fuhrer insisted that the operation be painted over a canvas. He was always creating opportunities to show off the techniques he learned from the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. \" Remember our Golden Rule: A thin paint sticks to a thick paint. You must shell the position with artillery before the sturmmann can advance. \" While the Fuhrer was definitely unconventional, with his constant references to painting and styling his hair in a cloud like perm, his military wisdom was revered by all. He had a magical vision for positioning units and utilizing battlefield terrain to win battles. \" We must also put a rifle platoon next to our artillery. Got ta give him a friend. Like I always say'everyone needs a friend. There were many rumors on where the Fuhrer learned battlefield tactics. Some say that he saved an old officer's life in the Great War, who then taught him all that he knew. Others say that the Fuhrer was merely a puppet, and that his plans are drawn up by secret advisers. \" In our world there lives a happy little tree over there. You know me, I got ta put in a big tree. And we'll give him some friends right..... there. Perfect. The enemy won't expect our panzers there. Haha, and we'll just beat the devil outta them. \" But there existed another rumor, although it was a very strange one. Some claimed that the Fuhrer was very deep in depression from being rejected from the art institute. One day, however, he was approached by a mentor who taught him a new painting technique. They say that this mentor was responsible for invigorating the Fuhrer, who went on to not only graduate the art institute, but to gain control of the nation. \" In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. We can use this power as well. We can move our enemies back, and we can bend them to our will. \" Rumors aside, the Generals were only happy to have a competent, well adjusted leader. The Fuhrer seemed as if he was at total peace with himself, and with the world. \" It's my world,\" The Fuhrer said with a smile. \" Just let it happen. \"",

Fortunately it-Samantha, as she has been trained to call herself by whatever practical joke assault team probably led by a vics relative or something had sent to me, Samantha was too muffled to distract or bother me. I should ask the Earth-Fooders about it if I remember. Poking in that wound of Samantha's death was a psychological attack. As an assassin (totally out of work) I just killed people; I did not fuck with their minds. Well different strokes for different folks. I slowed don on my Earth board, manufactured by a six-legger giraffe company for Earthlings, well I guess two and at times four of the legs are 7 fingered hands.

        "I wasn't as excited as my sisters were. We were triplets, and due to complications, we were born via C-Section, at exactly the same time. Something about being wrapped in each other's cords. Our birth killed our mother, and I felt like our father blamed us, or at least me. I was after all the unplanned extra, my parents had gone to a woman who could make sure your next birth was twins. I felt left out, they were identical, I was just the spare egg that had been floating around. At least that is how I heard them describe me as I sat in the hallway listening to them talk to their friends. I didn't have any friends. I was always too sick to be allowed out of the house, not that my father didn't try to shove us outside every chance he got. But my older brother would protect me, he would always make sure I was safe. He came into the hallway to wait with me as we counted down. \"It's almost time, are you ready for this?\" He smiled and took my hand in his. \"I dunno. I'm not very lucky...\" I tried to smile but just couldn't get excited about it, we had half an hour left after all. \"Don't be that way, I'm lucky to have you as a sister, and I think you're pretty lucky to have me too, don't you think?\" He winked and then raised an eyebrow at me. I couldn't help but smirk, and for the rest of the half hour we sat and made faces at each other, laughing softly so it wouldn't disturb the princesses' birthday party. I heard the countdown from the other room. I gripped his hand tighter, anticipation, fear, and hope, all battling to control me. As they reached zero I felt my brother start to fade away, and for half a moment I thought it was me. When I opened my eyes in shock I was greeted by the empty hallway, and suddenly I could hear my brother in my head. He was screaming. Begging me to let him out. To stop torturing him. I curled into a ball and tried to claw him out of my head. I woke up in the hospital. He was still screaming. It took weeks to start focusing on something else. Everyone blamed me for his disappearance, but I never told them what had happened. How could I ever explain that? They already hated me. I got kicked out. I was alone for a month before I finally met a girl that wasn't scared of me. I made sure not to touch her, not to get close to her at all. Months passed before a day came when I looked up, and for the first time I thought of her as my friend. She disappeared and I could hear her screaming alongside my brother.",
        "The move was confirmed during a backbench debate on the row over Carol Mills' choice as preferred candidate. Commons Speaker John Bercow decided recently to pause the process amid MPs' concerns about her suitability. Mr Straw told MPs that it was \"imperative\" that the future status and remit of the job was agreed upon. The clerk of the House is the principal constitutional adviser to the Commons, and adviser on all its procedure and business. Paid PS200,000 a year, he or she is also responsible for the overall administration of the House of Commons, including the signing of leases, contracts and public expenditure on Commons services. MPs have questioned the selection of Carol Mills - who works in the Australian Parliament - to replace the former Clerk Sir Robert Rogers, who retired in July. Speaking in a debate in the Commons, Jesse Norman - who has led opposition to the appointment - said disquiet over the job raised wider questions about how the Commons governed itself. \"This debate arises because of a widespread concern among colleagues across the House that the appointment process for the next clerk of this House was seriously flawed,\" he said. Mr Norman said the new committee - which will report early next year - would examine the question of whether the procedural and management roles of the Clerk should be divided between different officials. Mr Bercow, who headed the panel which originally chose Ms Mills but was not in the chair for Wednesday's debate, has said the proposal has merit and should be considered by MPs. Confirming his involvement, Mr Straw said the committee would look into the case for separating the roles and how that might work in practice and make a series of recommendations. However, he expressed concern that the committee was having to complete its work in nine weeks. Ex-Commons leader Andrew Lansley - who sat on the original selection panel - said he believed the appointment was mistaken and accused Mr Bercow of seeking to \"water down\" the requirement in the job description that the Clerk should have \"detailed knowledge of the procedures and practices of the House.\" He said he believed the entire appointment process should be abandoned and a clerk appointed on a temporary basis until the House reached agreement on the future of the role. But Labour MP Barry Sheerman said critics of the appointment had a \"secret agenda,\" which amounted to wanting to \"have a go at the Speaker.\" And Tory MP Philip Davies said colleagues of his who were using the row as a \"Trojan Horse for a personal vendetta\" against Mr Bercow looked \"absolutely ridiculous.\" For the government, deputy Commons leader Tom Brake said it was \"entirely proper\" for the committee to look into the matter, saying the terms of the review was an issue for MPs, not ministers. But he said it was important that it should be done in a \"timely manner\" and that the public should know which Commons officials were accountable for the \"substantial challenges\" the House faced.",
        "Hiding women away in the home hidden behind veils is a backward view of Islam, President Musharraf of Pakistan has said during a visit to Britain.He was speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme a few hours before visiting the Pakistani community in Manchester. \"My wife is travelling around. She is very religious but she is very moderate,\" said General Musharraf. It comes after Pakistan's High Commissioner to Britain said some Pakistanis should integrate more. Dr Maleeha Lodhi said people could not expect others to listen to their grievances if they isolated themselves.Gen Musharraf told the BBC: \"Some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out - absolutely wrong.\" The Pakistani president was also asked whether he thought the war on terror had made the world less safe. \"Yes, absolutely. And I would add that unfortunately we are not addressing the core problems, so therefore we can never address it in its totality,\" he said. \"We are fighting it in its immediate context but we are not fighting it in its strategic long-term context.\"It is the political disputes and we need to resolve them, and also the issue of illiteracy and poverty. This combined are breeding grounds of extremism and terrorism.\" On Monday the Pakistani president met Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street, on his first official visit to London. He is due to visit the Pakistani community in Manchester on Tuesday afternoon.The Mirror newspaper said on Tuesday it had been handed a sensitive dossier outling the details of Gen Musharraf's visit to Britain. The paper said the document had been found in a London street by a member of the public. It said the dossier contained details about his movements and also confidential police radio channels, call signs and codes. Speaking in London on Monday, Gen Musharraf said al-Qaeda was \"on the run\" in Pakistan.But standing next to Mr Blair he added that it was crucial to tackle the \"core of what creates terrorists, what creates an extremist, militant environment which then leads on to terrorism\". \"That is the resolution of political disputes.\"Mr Blair said the two leaders had talked about Afghanistan, the wider war on terror, the situation in the Middle East and the ongoing dispute over Kashmir. \"We agreed that in Afghanistan there is some cause for optimism about the progress that has been made there,\" said Mr Blair. \"In respect of Iraq, we agreed that whatever the issues of the past, the important thing now is to see the strategy through and ensure that Iraq is capable of becoming a stable and democratic state.\"",
        "Definitely not.  You are too young.  Let me explain: Your money will be locked up for at least 40 years, and you will have to navigate some really quirky and trap-laden rules in order to get money for simple things.  Let's say you want to buy a house.  You won't be able to leverage the 401K for that.  College Tuition?  Limits. Your money is locked in and you may get some match, but that assumes your smartest decision at your age is to save money for retirement.  At your age, you should be investing in your career, and that requires cash at hand.  If you want to withdraw early you pay more of a penalty than just the tax rate.   Put differently: investing in your human capital, at a young age, can yield stronger results than just squirreling money.  I'd say don't worry until you are 30. BTW: I'm 24 now.  I used to save money in a 401K for a few months, before I understood the rules.  Since then, I decided against 401K and just saved the money in a bank.  After a few years, I had enough to start my business :)  the 401K couldn't give me that opportunity. Further Explanation: I am in the NYC area.  Many of my friends and I had to decide between living in manhattan or choosing to live in the outer boroughs or NJ.  One thing I noticed was that, while the people in manhattan were burning much more money (to the tune of 1500 per month), they were actually much more productive and were promoted more often.  Having lived in brooklyn and in manhattan, even though it is less expensive, you actually lose at least an hour a day thanks to the commute (and have to deal with crap like the 6 train).  Personally, after moving in, I invested the extra time in myself (i.e. sleeping more, working longer hours, side projects).  Now, when all is said and done, the people who decided to invest in themselves in the short term are financially more secure (both job-wise and economically, thanks to a few bonus cycles) than those who decided to save on rent and put it in a 401K. As far as the traps are concerned, my dad tried to take out a student loan and was denied thanks to a Vanguard quirk which didnt allow more than 50K to be borrowed (even though the account had over 500K to begin with).",
        "Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for coupes other than they look cool or may be easier to park in places you wouldn't want to be driving anyways. Economy coupes used to be a budget choice for younger people who didn't need the space, so auto companies can also save money on two doors. Marginally better gas mileage may be an incentive as well. High end luxury sport car manufacturers can argue that the coupe offers better aerodynamicslower weight to improve performance and handling.Today, coupes cost the same if not more than the same model sedan. I don't believe a slimmer profile can noticeably improve performance in an economy 140HP car, similarly, I find the fuel economy improvement from 30 to 32 mpg hard to justify the loss of two doors at the same price. Automatic transmission performance used to be inferior to manuals, and an expert could handle a car with manual significantly better than an auto. Today, the highest performance cars come with automatics, and manual often isn't an option anymore. Even in models that offer both, the 0-60 and quarter mile speed is quite a bit better in the automatic, which offers \"manual shifting\" anyways. I believe that their long history and inferior counterparts has created a aura of superiority over automatics, similar to the Stradivarius violins. Due to production quantities, a manual transmission costs the same as automatic if not more. This leaves me with only a few situations where one would practically want a coupe: High end 400-500 HP sportscars which accelerate and go fast enough that the profile and marginal weight makes a difference. And for manual transmission: Old classic imitation cars for the nostalgia? They're plainly under performing now. Whenever I see a Bentley or Benz S550600 coupe, I cringe a bit since they're very obviously not performance based cars. Manual freaks who refuse to own any other cars also seem illogical as hell.

        "No . The rate at which a battery can be charged depends on the battery chemistry and construction , not its size . A big limitation is also charging devices . For example there are LiPo cells that can be fully charged in ten minutes or even less . They 're used in R / C applications a lot , for example . The problems are : 1 ) they are expensive 2 ) fast charging puts a lot of strain on the battery and this reduces the lifespan , which is bad for consumer electronics at large 3 ) balancing multiple cells becomes more difficult as you charge faster , 4 ) the logistics of it , i.e. the charger / charging circuitry Battery technology totally exists today that would allow you to fully charge your phone / laptop / tablet in 15 minutes . The issue is that you wo n't find a USB port anywhere that can source 50 amps in order to allow it . Nor will you find a laptop charger that will source 600 Watts because it would be comically large , and the vast majority of people do n't care enough about fast charging to lug one of those around just for that purpose . So the short answer is that the average consumer does not want super fast charging enough to put up with the downfalls and inconveniences . If you look at some stores that sell R / C equipment , you 'll find bigass batteries ( many times larger than anything in a phone / tablet / laptop ) that can be charged in ten minutes . You 'll also find the huge , expensive chargers that will let you charge them , some of which you ca n't run off a standard AC outlet without tripping the breaker . For something like the Tesla I imagine the driving features are cost and safety . One gigantic battery is possible but would be very expensive and unwieldy . You are also limited by your charging system , as usual . To charge the lower end Tesla ( 60 kiloWatt - hours ) in , say , half an hour ( assuming the battery chemistry supported it ) you 'd need to supply it with an average 120 kiloWatts . To put it in more common numbers , the 120V outlets in your home would need to be able to supply 1000 Amps . Household circuit breakers are generally 15 - 30 Amps except for bigger stuff like your stove / water heater / laundry . The circuit breaker that controls ALL of the power going into your house is typically something like 200 Amps . So , you 'd need over 4 times that . The cells in a Tesla are standard lithium - ion cylindrical cells with metal casings . Phones / tablets / fancy laptops have lithium - polymer batteries which generally support faster charge rates . They are also more fragile and prone to impressive fires if damaged .",

        "Billions of pounds spent on conflict in Iraq and in the Middle East should have been used to reduce poverty, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor has said.The head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales made the comments on BBC Radio 4 and will re-iterate his stance in his Christmas Midnight Mass. The cardinal used a Christmas message to denounce the war in Iraq as a \"terrible\" waste of money. He and the Archbishop of Canterbury have both spoken out about the war.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day slot, he criticised the fact that \"billions\" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people \"out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease\". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to \"make history poverty\". He added: \"If the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war, that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears.\" The cardinal will touch on this theme again on Friday night when he will tell the congregation of 2,000 at Westminster Cathedral that peace is \"worth, always, striving for\".\"How is it that peace has not arrived?,\" the cardinal will ask. \"How is it that there is war in Iraq, violence in the Holy Land, and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace?\" \"How can one wish a happy Christmas for our fellow Christians in Iraq or in the Holy Land or those who suffer in Africa unless you and I, in whatever way is open to us, say and do what makes for peace?\" Both the Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in Iraq before the war started. Dr Williams has since criticised the government over its case for war, saying the failure to find weapons of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system.On Friday, the Cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace. \"It is possible, it is real, it is worth, always, striving for, because of the promise of Our Saviour,\" he will say. \"I also wish you peace in your homes because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the homes of the community. \" A spokesman said Downing Street had no comment to make. But Prime Minister Tony Blair has said he will put Africa at the top of the agenda when Britain chairs the G8 summit next year.",
        "Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. An example of the directing: When Candy (Jean Peters) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in -- as if it's an alarm going off in her head. It's not cartoon-like -- it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just \"clicks\" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag.<br /><br />Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart-alec -- he's really great -- but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for \"Moe,\" the street peddler/informer, played by Thelma Ritter. Later, in her apartment, you are not seeing a movie -- you're seeing a real person. I've never seen anyone \"act\" so real I felt like I was looking into a real room until Ritter's performance -- right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat. <br /><br />About a million other things just *worked,* from the way Lightning Louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way Candy's jewelry clicks when she flicks Moe's hand away from her brooch, to the way Moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the FBI guy's chest -- and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet, like he's been doing it in that way in that room for many years. \"Pickup On South Street\" is detailed moves (directing) with consummate performances (acting) and superb now-nostalgic visuals of the day, such as the panel truck, the boards leading to the shack out on the water, the dumbwaiter, -- and the unforgettable place Skip stashes his pocket pickings. Wonderful stuff.<br /><br />\"Pickup On South Street\" is also one of the few movies where, even though the characters aren't perfect, you do care about them -- perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape: Skip as a \"three-time loser\" and Candy as a youngish woman who has \"knocked around\" a lot. When these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect, it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine -- and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human.",
        "Sergeant Coleman of the SAS had seen more than his fair share of battle. Yet ambushes were something even the elite can't always prepare for, his convoy as testament upon erupting in a series of explosions, but as it did, a voice rumbled into existence. \"I am your daughters what you would call'imaginary' friend, and she made me promise to protect you, but it comes with a price\" The voice was rasp but distinct, like it reverberated off the skull, intertwining with the rattles of gunfire and shelling. Coleman lay untouched next to the wreck of his vehicle, all occupants but him dead inside. Assessing the situation, their convoy came under attack from both IEDs and RPGs, with the explosions sending all vehicles in different directions, how he survived was a mystery. Doubled with hearing voices he thought he was dead, until a stray bullet glanced his arm and the white hot burn snapped him back to reality. \"Wh.... what? Who are you?\" \"Who I am is not important, whether you wish to survive is. Three approaching your six, Sergeant\" There it was again, whether it was the shell shock or his comms he couldn't tell, didn't care as he spun into cover as bullets whizzed by overhead, exactly where he was standing just moments before. \"God damn it, I don't care the cost just get me out of here!\" Assessing his options, Coleman saw two points of cover, sandbags or a building. Whilst blindly firing into the hills, the voice returned..... \"The building, might want to use one of those grenades of yours, run quickly now...\" The voice trailed off as Coleman burst out of cover. The sand kicked and danced around him as he sprinted to the house and threw the frag inside. The resulting screams sent a shiver down his spine. How did whatever was helping him know? Bursting through the door the damage was already done, through the window he saw the sandbags get hit by a stray mortar, and explode upwards in a spray of sand and dust. \"Delta squad under attack! I repeat!\" The soft crackle confirmed his radios demise, just as an enemy silhouette materialised in front of the door with his gun raised. \"Click, click, click....... Click\" Four dead man's clicks? What were the odds? Coleman thought as he sunk two in his enemies chest. Suddenly he realised his wasn't the only presence. \"You humans and your odds and chances, no you must live this day, for I forever keep my promises as you must keep yours...\" It trailed off again, this time the vibration in his head seemed to finally leave, yet as he watched from the window the enemy emplacements misfired sending explosions all across the mountainside. Coleman reached for the photo of his daughter, and found a burn where her face used to be. \"What have I done?\"",
        "Christmas Fight Club. A noble tradition, a contest of strength and agility. Teams to represent each of the Twelve Days of Christmas, as listed in the popular song, fought each other in hand-to-hand combat, with the winners walking away with a staggering holiday hamper1. Of the teams, the Ten Lords A-Leaping were the usual winners, though not every time. They always put on a good show and a good showing, though - they'd never done worse than fourth place, and many teams had yet to beat them. The Eight Maids a-Milking were also favoured, as they tended to be brutal and slippery, stocky lasses who could carry barrels. On the other hand, the Seven Swans A-Swimming were never well-liked, as they tended to be dirty fighters and elitist snobs, and the poor Partridge had to be chased down from rooftops every year. There was never any certainty over the winner each year, but as a matter of fact not one of the spectators nor contestants could have predicted this year's winner: The Five Golden Rings. Ordinarily, the Rings were a laughingstock - momma's boys born with silver spoons and jelly legs. They were often too afraid to actually fight, surrendering at the first sign of danger, but as they entered the ring against their traditional fight against the Swans, everybody could tell there was something different. They'd replaced their leader. Last year they had been lead by Herbert Shaw, as knock-kneed a nancy as you could think of. No longer was the pale imitation of a man heading them - instead a new lad, slightly older than the others, with a strong face, deep eyes and dark hair. Under this man's tutelage - the others called him Sir Awn - the Rings learned to ignore pain, and to use it to their own ends. Their first match was a slaughter - and only the referee (dressed as the tree) stopped anyone from going to hospital. They won the rest of the tournament handily, and as they stepped up to receive their prizes, the referee had to ask..... \"How did you do it? What makes you so great, so powerful that you can turn these ordinary snivelling weaklings into hard, cold monsters of combat?\" To this, Sir Awn simply brandished his hand, and the ring upon it - as did the others in his team. He spoke, with intonations that made hair stand on end and sense shrivel into terror: \"One ring to rule them all. One ring to find them. One ring to bring them all, And in the winter bind them. In the field of combat, As the snowfall lies.\" 1 The traditional victor's trophy was an entire roast oxen, but as those became more expensive and less socially acceptable, the hamper was introduced.",
        "Pocket Trains is a business simulation video game developed by NimbleBit for iOS and Android.  It was published on the App Store on 15 September 2013 for iOS.\n\nGameplay \n\nSimilar to Pocket Planes, the game focuses on running a transportation network system. The player starts with small steam trains of limited fuel and speed that can carry a small amount of cargo, and/or passenger cars. Earning coins from delivering jobs, the player slowly expands their rail network to include more cities and better trains. Like Pocket Planes, Pocket Trains uses real cities around the world and has quasi-realistic costs to purchase tracks and cities relative to the real world.\n\n\"Jobs\" are single delivery tasks offered to trains. They are priced based on the distance from the originating station to the destination. Although multiple jobs may be headed to the same destination, different types of jobs may be more profitable than others. Jobs can be held at stations for transfer between trains or for later transport.\n\nCertain jobs involve the delivery of \"Crates\", which are placed into the player's inventory upon delivery. Crates can be opened using the second currency 'Bux' and contain parts for trains that can be built once all the necessary components are achieved.\n\nThere are also special jobs that earn the player a secondary in-game currency called \"Bux\". This currency can be used to buy coins, allow more jobs to be held in yards at stations, speed up trains, and open crates. Bux can also be purchased with money.\n\nCrates, Coins and Bux can also be received by watching the train travel screen, and tapping on the resources as they pass by.\n\nReception \n\nPocket Trains has been received well by critics. Metacritic described it as a \"fun ride\", giving it an aggregated score of 76/100. Toucharcade rated it 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying it was \"yet another fun title\" when comparing it to Pocket Planes. Gamezebo also rated it 4.5/5 stating it was a \"charming, highly addictive\" game. Pocket Gamer rated it 7/10, calling it an \"impressively simple time-waster\", but noting that it \"is a little too similar to its airborne predecessor\", referring to Pocket Planes. However, Edge Online rated it 5/10, complaining \"expansion is painfully slow\".\n\nSee also \nPocket Planes\nPocket Frogs\nNimbleBit\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n NimbleBit's official website\n\nSimulation video games\n2013 video games\nAndroid (operating system) games\nIOS games\nVideo games developed in the United States",
        "These explanations are all brutal if you 're supposed to be actually explaining DX to laymen . I will put everything in point form because I 'm a software engineer and do n't believe in wasting my time with stupid crap like grammar , haha . - DirectX is a piece of software ( called an API ) developed by Microsoft for their Windows Operating System - It allows programs on your computer , such as video games , CAD software , etc to access your computer 's hardware ( such as graphics , sound , keyboard and mouse ) in a very lightweight manner - Very importantly , it allows hardware independence . This means that the same video game will work on every computer without having to be rewritten for every single machine it 's expected to run on - It is actually composed of a couple of components : Direct3D , DirectShow , DirectSound , DirectInput , and a few more I 'm probably missing . - By far , the most important of these ( and the one MS has sunk the most time and money into ) is Direct3D. - As you may know , everything you see in a 3D video game is made of a bunch of polygons . Even if you see a sphere , it 's actually made of a bunch of tiny triangles that are so small that they give the illusion of a smooth curve . - Here is an example of Leon from Resident Evil 4 to help you visualize this fact : URL_0 - Direct3D allows video games to say to the 3D graphics hardware , \" Hey man , here are a bunch of triangles and here are instructions on where to put them , what color they should be , what textures they should have , how to light them up , etc \" - DirectSound allows video games to say to the sound card , \" Hey dude , here is a sound wave I want to you play through the speakers at this volume , with this speed , and I want you to mix it with several other sounds \" - A version of DirectX has shipped with Windows ever since Windows 95 , but they were horrible . - Windows XP shipped with DirectX 9 , which was considered to be the first version of DX that did n't totally suck . - Ever since then , DirectX 10 came with Vista and DirectX 11 with Windows 7 . - Video games are generally tested with very specific subversions of DirectX , Ex .

        "A proposed amendment to the Finance Bill by the SNP and Plaid Cymru, which would have prevented the increase, was defeated by a majority of 295. A Labour-backed amendment calling for the move to be delayed pending an assessment of its impact on vulnerable groups was also defeated. Ministers have said the tax rise is \"unavoidable\" to reduce the deficit. In a further vote, MPs approved the VAT rise by 321 to 246, a government majority of 75. The votes came during a lengthy debate on the bill, which enacts last month's Budget, in the Commons. Chancellor George Osborne has said the planned rise in the main rate of VAT from 17.5 to 20 is estimated to raise PS13bn towards reducing the PS155bn deficit. The move was controversial as the Conservatives said they had \"no plans\" to raise it during the election while the Lib Dems attacked the Tories - now their now-coalition partners - saying their plans would necessitate a \"VAT bombshell.\" But neither the Conservatives, Labour nor the Lib Dems ruled out raising VAT before the general election. MPs discussed a group of 16 opposition amendments - including a bid by the SNP to scrap the rise altogether and several Labour amendments, including one which would delay the VAT rise until the government has assessed its impact on pensioners, children and those on low fixed incomes. The SNP amendment was defeated by 316 votes to 21. Another Labour amendment, which was also defeated, would have exempted groups such as charities, local authorities and other groups from the VAT rise. A Lib Dem MP, Andrew George, tabled an amendment to peg the rise to just 0.5 - from 17.5 to 18. \"Of all the measures to restore the public finances it seems to me that a VAT rise has to be among the least welcome of all of the alternatives,\" he told MPs. Treasury minister David Gauke said VAT was \"one of the few levers available\" to the government to address the shortfall in the public finances. \"Any sensible government would consider it. And, given the circumstances we're in, any government would do it.\" He added: \"We had to raise VAT because there was no money left.\" But shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Liam Byrne said Britain's pensioners may face \"an PS8bn VAT bill over the course of this Parliament.\" In an interview with the BBC's Daily Politics earlier, shadow chancellor Alistair Darling confirmed Labour had looked at raising VAT to 18 or 19 and said he did \"not have a philosophic problem with that\" as long as \"you do something to help people on low fixed incomes\" like pensioners and to ease the effect of spending cuts. He said Labour's amendment was not a \"blanket refusal to put up VAT\" but a \"reasoned and considered amendment\" which was calling on the government to do more to help those worst hit by a VAT rise.",
        "Note: A film that is bad means that the various elements of the film (directing, writing, acting, photographyvisual composition, editing, soundtrack ect.) are objectively bad or don't work together. Pete Travis's 2012 film Dredd starring Karl Urban receives a lot of praise from many (not all) people over at rmovies and reddit in general (I don't know to many people irl that have seen the film but of the few people they thought it was a great film). The praise people give the film and the non-existance of the criticism of the film confusing. In what ways is the film good? The writing was very unoriginal (I can think of about 20 films of the top of my head that are action packed dystopian violent films, not to mention it had a very similar plot to The Raid: Redemption), had terribly written characters (a 12 year old could have thought of characters with more depth and complexity) and the overall story depended way to much on the action. The acting was bad. There I said it. I have no idea what people see in Karl Urban, maybe it was because the character of the Judge was already terrible but Urban did not bring his A-game to that movie. Lena Headey also was average in the film, Mama was meant to be this extremely brutal and evil character with a tragic and horrorfying past. However the writer, Pete Travis and Lena Headey did a terrible job at trying to communicate this to the audience. She wasn't fearful or even intimidating, I get that Pete Travis was trying to show that women can be even more cruel and dominate than men by making the antagonist a female but it just didn't work. The directing style of Pete Travis is something of a redeemable feature. I suppose the film is a lot like the 2003 film Equilibrium, the style was bold and is the main reason for the appeal, even if the film itself is pretty average. The extreme violence along with the slow motion sequences, and visual techniques to achieve shots like [this] does separate the film some what from the other hundreds of dystopian action films. However overall Dredd is just a regular dystopian action film with bad writingacting and some interesting directing style. I have no idea why it has such a large fanbase. Dredd is a bad film, CMV.

        "The worst day of my life was upon me, I lay in bed staring at the celling as the sun slowly began to fill my room. My mum would do her best to make me feel special she always did that, tried to protect me from the real world, pretend that everything would always be fine. So I just lay there and waited for my mum to come in and shout \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" ecstatically just like she did every year. As I lay there I began to wonder how I would find out, nobody no's when or how they will see the \"time\" it just appears and only they can see it. Take my mum for example apparently she saw hers on a birthday card from her parents. I glanced at the clock 8:20. I was surprised she wasn't here yet mum always wanted me to enjoy the day to the fullest. As she so kindly put it \"you can sleep when your dead.\" I couldn't help but chuckle, the first time mum had said that to me she had to literally pull me out of bed. I was \"tired\" and didn't want to get up. 8:40, I was really starting to wonder what was taking her so long I couldn't stay like this much longer I was starting to get restless and a little hungry. 20 minutes if she wasn't here in 20 minutes I was going to go find her, tradition or no tradition this was getting ridiculous. It took all my self control just to lay there, she was just late that was all probably slept in or something. Maybe she thought we would do something this year or she had an even bigger surprise for me. 9:00 I got out of bed and left my room, I was half expecting to hear the sound of sizzling bacon or the sound of the kettle boiling. There was none of that the house was quiet. \"Mum!\" I yelled as I headed to her room, I was starting to get a little nervous was something wrong was she.... dead? \"Don't be stupid,\" I thought. \"Mum said her time wasn't for another few years everything is fine.\" \"Then why isn't she answering?\" The thought sent chills down my spine as I ran to my mums room I barged in not bothering to knock and found my mum laying in bed. \"See she's just sleeping.\" \"Hey mum wake up come on it's my birthday we have to celebrate.\" No answer \"Mum? Mum can you hear me?\" I asked giving her a little shove. Nothing happened. I was getting scared again as I put two fingers to my mums neck and felt for a pulse. There wasn't one. I went to the dresser and pulled out the gun I knew would be there, raising the pistol to my head I smiled seeing one word written in blood red on my mums bed before saying \"happy birthday to me.\"",
        "My friends and I had a poor first experience at Rx Boiler Room last night. We arrived around 10:15pm looking for dinner. The restaurant was mostly empty except for a couple of bar patrons, 2 or 3 four tops and a party of 12 (or so) in the back. We were a party of 7, and it took the hostess a few minutes to figure out where to seat us. The table selected needed to he cleaned so we waited a few minutes for that to happen. This was the first of several red flags for the night as it was over 5 minutes for the staff to clean and set the table After seating we ordered a round of drinks, water and some appetizers. The drinks arrived in 10 minutes, apps arrived in 15 minutes, and the waiter came around to get out dinner drink order. We had to ask for appetizer plates. Twice. Eventually they arrived. Another 10 minutes elapsed while the waiter informed a member if our party that her light beer wasn't available. Strange that they have Miller Lite and Bud Light but no Coors Light? Anyway, drink order was still incomplete as I was asked three times about which beer I had ordered (Innis and Gunn, off the menu). The food was decent. Not outstanding for the price, but acceptable. Approaching 45 minutes since our arrival, still no 2nd round and we hadn't ordered dinner. We made the decision to leave and a member of our party approached the manager. The manager apologized (ok) and then proceeded to claim no knowledge of a problem (hmm), blame us for not saying something sooner (not ok), and then had the temerity to ask us to give his restaurant another try. FAIL. Sorry, mate. The manager should know what's going on. When he sees apps on the table, menus still on the table, no app plates, no drinks and it's been a while.... He should stop by and ask if we are ok. Instead he didn't engage, and as a result he lost is as customers. And I'm sharing our poor experience with other Yelpers in hopes that you won't suffer as we did. Epilogue: We walked to another restaurant in Mandalay Place, arriving a few minutes after 11. Within minutes we were seated, our drink order was promptly filled and food was quickly served. We finished, happily full, at 11:45. Rx Boiler Room, take that as a lesson on how to serve customers.",
        "Nigerian Keshi, who died suddenly aged 54, was appointed head coach of Togo three times between 2004 and 2011. The match in Lome was played between the current Togo national side and'Team Keshi', made up of players who were part of his 2006 squad. \"Keshi was like a big brother for me,\" said striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who played for Team Keshi. \"He was somebody that I respected a lot and I have to give him a lot of credit because when he joined the Togolese national team he believed in me. \"He was for the first time looking into my eyes and told me how good I was and how good I could become. \"I just listened to his advice because he was a former footballer. Listening to his advice helped me a lot and today I am where I am because of that of that. \"May his soul rest in a perfect peace and let's us keep on remembering him in our prayers.\" Keshi will be most widely remembered for his feats with Nigeria, both as an Africa Cup of Nations-winning player and coach. But he also will be associated deeply with Togo, who gave him his first coaching job - and he pulled off a remarkable achievement to qualify them for the 2006 World Cup finals, ahead of Senegal and Zambia. However, he was sacked by Togo just a few months before the tournament in Germany. Keshi returned for two more spells - appointed in 2007 and 2001 - but was unable to repeat his earlier success with the Hawks. More than 20,000 fans were in attendance at the Ominsports stadium in Lome to watch the game, which finished 6-2 to the current Togo national side. After the match. Adebayor told the crowd: \"I would like to pay tribute to him and I hope that the family he left behind will find the needed faith and strength to overcome this period.\" Abalo Dosseh, deputy coach and former captain of Togo, told BBC Sport: \"It is an honour for me to stand on this pitch in remembrance of Big Boss. He has done a lot for Togolese football and the entire continent. \"I always remember the day I asked to captain the team for the first time and we were also lucky to make the same year to the World Cup. \"All the former players and others who are still playing have come to pay tribute to him.\" Toglose former player Olufade Adekambi, who also played alongside Keshi, added: \"We thank God that he did many good things for Togo. We are still mourning him because he was like a big brother, a coach and a big man.\"",
        "The chain says it will commit to paying 28p per litre for 100 of its liquid milk throughout its entire range. It is less than the 30-32p farmers estimate it costs to produce each litre but the farming union welcomed it. Asda's announcement comes after protests by dairy farmers at branches of Asda, Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi over the price they are paid for their milk. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said it was pleased Asda had recognised the \"plight of the dairy industry\" in its \"hour of need.\" The industry says a reduction in global demand for milk has led to an over-supply in the UK, creating difficult conditions for many dairy farmers. Asda said it would increase the price it paid per litre to its milk supplier Arla from Monday, with the intention that it be passed directly on to farmers. \"Asda's origins are in dairy farming which is why we are acting in the best interests of our farmers and our customers by increasing the price we pay, introducing the Farmer's Marque label and not passing on any of the costs to customers - our retail price stays the same,\" he said. It is not yet clear whether Arla, Britain's biggest milk co-operative, will pass on the increase in price to farmers. Meurig Raymond, NFU president, urged Arla to ensure it passed the extra payment on \"with immediate effect.\" Asda previously announced a price cut of 0.8p per litre - taking the standard litre price to 23.01p for its UK members. On Tuesday, Morrisons said it was launching a new milk brand which will see 10p per litre extra paid to farmers. The Milk for Farmers brand, to be launched in October, means a four pint bottle (2.27 litres), which now sells for 89p, will cost an extra 23p. The four main farming unions - the NFU, the NFU Cymru, NFU Scotland and the Ulster Farmers Union - held an emergency summit on Monday to develop an action plan to tackle falling milk, lamb and arable prices. There have been days of protests by farmers including milk trolley challenges, blockades at distribution centres and even bringing cattle into supermarkets. The average price paid to dairy farmers for milk across the UK is 23.66p - following a drop of 25 in a year. The NFU said that currently Waitrose, Marks Spencer, Tesco, Sainsbury's and the Co-op have arrangements where a farmer is paid a price above the cost of production for milk. Asda, Lidl and Aldi currently do not offer such deals to farmers. Why is the milk row happening? NI agriculture minister seeks EU lobby support Welsh farming leader suggests cow cull",
        "Alicia, now she was a real piece of work. Said she didn't feel good. Sat there sulking at our meeting. We were supposed to be discussing the next step on our research assignment on the cardiovascular effects of diabetes on women over 50 but she sat there, quiet, staring at her phone. So I poked, I proded, trying to get her to talk. I mean, if she was just another coworker I wouldn't care, but we were sort of friends at this point. She had a way of trapping you in a friendship. But yeah, finally she responded with, \"I was assaulted.\" And then back to silently staring at her phone. If that were her excuse for not having her work done, and not being prepared for this meeting, it was pretty messed up. But I gave her the benefit of the doubt. I poked some more, she refused to answer. \"People say I'm beautiful. I hear that at least five times a day. It's amazing.\" She said that as she admired herself in her phone-mirror. I had no response to that, so I suggested ending the meeting and reconvening at another, more convenient, time. \"Sure, leave me, that's what I deserve.\" At this point I started to get pretty annoyed. Do you want to talk, then, I ask. \"You're a man, you won't understand.\" I didn't even know what to say to that. I wanted to say, okay don't talk to me, then. Or I wanted to just get my things and leave. But as infuriating as she was, I also felt bad for her. Or she made me feel bad for her. I mean, she had just said she was assaulted. So I decided to stick around and ask her again what happened, even though I didn't care and wouldn't understand. Finally, she relented. Or this was just the next move in the game she was playing. She finally looked up from her phone, tears in her eyes. \"You know the support group I run for discrminated youth at the student union? This man came in and yelled at us and told us we were wasting everyone's time! He was so rude and obnoxious. And obviously he walks away without any consequences.\" I was confused, and it showed in my expression. \"Well, you could say I was verbally assaulted,\" she said. I swept up my things and walked out.",
        "I am quite open to changing my view on this topic. I'd like somebody to talk me through the economic reasoning for having interest, before discussing the pros and cons, and moral implications. The reason I believe it should be banned at the moment is because it allows money to be made simply from having wealth. It is a vehicle for the wealthy to accumulate wealth from the poor. Also, there is no choice. If you want a loan, or have a bank account, you MUST payreceive interest. There is no way you can withdraw your consent on ideological grounds: therefore we are trapped by interest. What are the results of this? It means payday loan companies like wonga can carry out state-sanctioned theft of your possessions and home to cover your debts. It means that you are penalised for not being rich. To say this is allowed when really there is no way you can disagree with the system seems wrong to me. But why ban it? I admit I have only been clued into this view because usury is something that is criticised in Abrahamic religions. My view is not well informed and so I would like some people to convince me of the opposite view. EDIT- So my view has evolved a bit, and to help me process everything I'm going to post a couple of points here. 1. So the main benefits of interest seem to be - compensating financiers for lending money, allowing small businesses to have access to capital, and allowing people to own items they otherwise wouldn't be able to. I am realising that economies will grind to halt if financiers cannot make money out of lending money without a viable alternative. 2. There does seem to be an alternative to interest in the form of Islamic Banking, whereby interest is not charged. Another system has been illustrated by uProjectShamrock [here] Whether these are good or bad systems is still unclear to me, but it illustrates alternatives are possible. 3. The way we charge interest in western societies directly empowers financiers. It is banks who decide interest rates, not their customers (who lend them money when they open a bank account) or the borrowers. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "Well... This has been on my chest for a long time, so I am trying to reclaim a new perspective on something that has been baffling me for years. I[19 M] am a black teenageryoung adult (whichever you prefer). I am nothing special, grew up in the inner city and experienced some trials and tribulations. However, I am quite different from the my friends and family in this one area. Cutting to the chase, I never identified with my culture a huge amount. I don't have any underlying issues with being black, I don't embrace it and I don't reject it, because that seems logical right? But I keep encountering this pro \"black pride\" or \"African-American\" centered worldview of my peers and even older adults. For example, the majority of my black peers centrally surround themselves within black communities, they only have black friends and significant others, only listen to hip-hop and rap, only wear nike's and embrace values and tendencies of other black people. To make a long post even longer, although I have for several reasons indicated to family and friends that I have never, and probably will never desire a romantic relationship with a black women, they either a) ignore me or b) repeatedly try to fix me up with black women, and make a point to repeatedly bring the topic up. It's horrible! I am at my wits end because even when I try to have a conversation about anything, it comes back to this \"Afrocentric\" mentality. Me and my grandparents will have a conversation about presidents. I will casually point out that I personally am intrigued President Truman's Re-election campaign. Geuss what? They will immediately without fail, disregard whatever I said and say \"but what do you think of Barack Obama.\" What blows my mind even more, I hear young, and fairly intelligent friends say things along the lines as \"I can't stand republicans\" or \"black are on the rise,\" or some other ignorant bs, about a topic they know nothing about. Please CMV... for my sanity, why does the problem subsist and why can't I manage to understand my peers and family in this one area? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot] , and the casting of [Emma Stone as Allison Ng in Aloha] . Now, I know both of these examples aren't perfect opposites, but the reception has been wildly different. When Michael B. Jordan was cast as the new Human Torch, people were thrilled. Despite the Human Torch [never once being black in the comics] , people said this was a good step forward in the superhero film community, and even that changing the typically white role to an black role would add levels of complexity to the story. On the other hand, critics called Stone's casting \"culturally insensitive,\" despite Cameron Crowe stating that the fact she's predominantly white, and has to constantly explain her \"unlikely heritage,\" was an actual aspect of her character, based on a real life redhead with 14 Chinese heritage. I don't mind casting people of color in typically white roles. I think it's good and it should be as inconsequential as POC involvement in other areas of life in the 21st century. In fact, in areas dominated by white characters, like the Marvel Universe, I'm completely open to the idea of adding more roles for POC. But when usually white roles are filled by POC, there's a lot of praise for reaching out and involving other races. Why not just focus on either creating films that feature black or other minority characters, like the [Black Panther] comics), or even start creating more original POC characters to reflect the changing racial landscape? Why is the casting itself of a mixed race character portrayed by a white actor \"insensitive?\" I'd love to hear other thoughts. I've only seen these two issues (minority casting of white roles and white casting of minority roles) tackled separately. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "International oil and mining companies have reacted cautiously to Russia's decision to bar foreign firms from natural resource tenders in 2005.US oil giant Exxon said it did not plan to take part in a new tender on a project for which it had previously signed a preliminary agreement. Miner Highland Gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while BP, a big investor, declined to comment. Only firms at least 51% Russian-owned will be permitted to bid.The Federal Natural Resources Agency said \"the government is interested in letting Russian companies develop strategic resources\". The foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to Russia's competition law, natural resources minister Yuri Trutnev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. No further details were given, with Mr Trutnev suggesting that Russia may decide on a case-by-case basis. Observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy, as the administration of Vladimir Putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics. Russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stock-market listed company Yukos, a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors.Analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals.Companies echoed this sentiment, saying that they would require more information before ringing the alarm bells. \"It's not good. But it is very understandable,\" said Al Breach, an economist at UBS Brunswick. \"But if the investment climate is stable - that's much more important. \"Foreigners of course would like to have free entry but... this is not the end of the world.\" A number of other nations, including Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, protect their national resources from foreign firms. What has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism Russia has been courting foreign investment.BP spent $7.5bn to create Russian-registered oil company TNK-BP, and has a partnership to develop the Sakhalin 5 petroleum field with state-owned Rosneft. Exxon, the world's largest oil company, has signed preliminary agreements to develop the Sakhalin 3 field. Company spokesman Glenn Waller said Exxon still considered the deal valid, despite Russia inviting new offers for the land block. According to Mr Waller, Exxon \"were not planning to bid at a new tender anyway\". \"We regret the ministry has taken such a decision,\" said Ivan Kulakov, deputy chairman of Highland Gold - a mining firm that has the motto \"Bringing Russia's Gold to Market\". \"It would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate.\" Other firms that have been linked with investment in Russia include France's Total, the US-based ChevronTexaco, and miner Barrick Gold.",
        "The original LOTR movies are masterpieces of fantasy filmmaking made with true heart and soul telling the epic story of the one true ring. It had characters i cared about and liked with great character development and truly memorable scenes and sub plots that you rememered long after you had seen the films. The Hobbit is the exact opposite of that. Everything feels so cheap and dumbed down. Like in the commentary track for the original they mentioned that they didn't put subtitles on place names like Minas Tirith because they thought the audience would be able to figure it out on their own but the very first thing that happens in The Hobbit 2 is an establishing shot of Bree and a subtitle telling us where we are despite the fact that we know the place very well from the previous film. It's like a double insult to our intelligence considering their attitude towards subtitles in the first film. There was a charming complexety to the first movies because the filmmakers weren't trying to spell things out to the audience. There are far too many characters to keep track of and because of that I end up not connecting to or getting to know any of them. I can name maybe 3 dwarfs and I've seen both movies twice. Despite the extremely long runtime no time is set aside to get to know these people with sub plots and charactirasation so I have no reason to care about any of them. This also make the lengthy fight sequences redundant because I don't care about the characters so it all becomes the equalent of dangling key chain in front of my face. It may be fun to a certain degree but it gets old quick. And when it feels like they might just start letting us get to know them they waste time introducing characters that weren't even in the original story to begin with. And then the main character that I'm supposed to care about and get to know is grossly under developed and nearly forgotten. Bilbo is just sort of there, especially in the second movie, apart from the end. He does save the dwarfs in some situations but that's sort of it, I don't care about them so there's nothing really at stake. It all just becomes sort of boring. Then there's the completely useless sub plot of Gandalf trying to figure out that Sauron is coming back and I don't care about that because I already know everything from the first movies. It's just useless boring filler with no payoff. There's probably much more but I'm not gonna say much more here. It just sort of feels like Peter Jackson tried to squeeze as much stuff into the movies as possible in order to spread it out over 3 movies in order to make as much money as possible. It's so dense, every single frame has so many things going on.",
        "Once upon a time in a castle...... Two little girls are playing in the garden's castle. They are sisters. A blonde little girl (Kitty) and a brunette one (Evelyn). Evelyn steals Kitty's doll. Kitty pursues Evelyn. Running through long corridors, they reach the room where their grandfather, sitting on an armchair, reads the newspaper. Kitty complains about Evelyn, while Evelyn is looking interestedly at a picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn begins to say repeatedly: \"I am the red lady and Kitty is the black lady\". Suddenly Evelyn grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs Kitty's doll and then cuts her (the doll's) head. A fight ensues. And Evelyn almost uses the dagger against Kitty. The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided.<br /><br />Later on, their grandfather tells them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them, in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in red:<br /><br />\"A long time ago, a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle. They were sisters and hated each other. One night, for jealousy reasons, the black lady entered the red lady's room and stabbed her seven times. One year later, the red lady left her grave. She killed six innocent people, and her seventh victim was the black lady. Once every hundred years, the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself.\"<br /><br />The grandfather ends his tale by saying that according to the legend, sixteen years from now, the red queen should come again and kill seven times. But he assures them that this is just an old legend.<br /><br />Sixteen years pass.....<br /><br />This is the very beginning of the film. There are many twists and surprises in the film. It's better for you to forget about logic (if you really analyse it, the story doesn't make sense) and just follow the film with its wonderful colors, the gorgeous women, the clothes, the tasteful decor, the lighting effects and the beautiful soundtrack.<br /><br />Enjoy Barbara Bouchet, Sybil Danning, Marina Malfatti, Pia Giancaro, among other goddesses. There's a nude by Sybil Danning lying on a sofa that's something to dream about.

        "Propane is better than charcoal for a multitude of reasons. It is easier to control the temperature. Propane can be easily stored in your grill. You don't have to worry about it getting wet. It doesn't take up an inordinate amount of space. It's better for the environment. Charcoal requires dead trees. The good charcoal (not the kingston bricks) is made by slowly burning a tree for hours releasing huge amounts of smoke and debris into the atmosphere. Many good grills are designed to be used with propane and it makes grilling easy for beginners. Charcoal takes much longer to light. If you're using inst-light charcoal, grilling too early is actually very unhealthy. You have to wait for all of the coals to be completely white, or else you'll be eating the fumes from the lighter fluid in the coals. Some of the arguments against propane are easily dispelled. For instance: \"It's more dangerous.\" It's just as dangerous as lighter fluid. \"Charcoal makes your steaks taste better\" If you want a nice smoked flavor you can throw a could of wood chips on a propane grill. And if you're getting all of your flavor from the charcoal you're not seasoning correctly. \"Propane is more expensive\" That may be so but it's worth it.

        "Galvani Bioelectronics hopes to bring a new treatment based on the technique before regulators within seven years. GlaxoSmithKline and Verily, formerly Google, Life Sciences, are behind it. Animal experiments have attached tiny silicone cuffs, containing electrodes, around a nerve and then used a power supply to control the nerve's messages. One set of tests suggested the approach could help treat type-2 diabetes, in which the body ignores the hormone insulin. They focused on a cluster of chemical sensors near the main artery in the neck that check levels of sugar and the hormone insulin. The sensors send their findings back to the brain, via a nerve, so the organ can coordinate the body's response to sugar in the bloodstream. GSK vice-president of bioelectronics Kris Famm told the BBC News website: \"The neural signatures in the nerve increase in type 2-diabetes. \"By blocking those neural signals in diabetic rats, you see the sensitivity of the body to insulin is restored.\" And early work suggested it could work in other diseases too. \"It isn't just a one-trick-pony, it is something that if we get it right could have a new class of therapies on our hands,\" Mr Famm said. But he said the field was only \"scratching the surface\" when it came to understanding which nerve signals have what effect in the body. Both the volume and rhythm of the nerve signals could be having an effect rather than it being a simple case of turning the nerve on or off. And even if the approach works theoretically, a huge amount of effort will be needed to make the technology practical. The kits to hack the nerves will need to be miniaturised, customisable to different patients' nerves, durable enough to survive in the body long-term and have sufficient battery power. Dr Famm added: \"In 10 to 20 years I think there will be a set of these miniaturised precision therapies that will be available for you and me when we go to a doctor.\" Verily chief technology officer Brian Otis said: \"Bioelectronic medicine is a new area of therapeutic exploration, and we know that success will require the confluence of deep disease biology expertise and new highly miniaturised technologies. \"This partnership provides an opportunity to further Verily's mission by deploying our focused expertise in low power, miniaturised therapeutics and our data analytics engine to potentially address many disease areas with greater precision with the goal of improving outcomes.\" Follow James on Twitter.",
        "KYKR (95.1 FM, \"Kicker 95.1\") is a radio station broadcasting a Country format.  Licensed to Beaumont, Texas, it serves the Beaumont/Port Arthur metropolitan area, owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.  The \"Kicker\" branding and country format were first broadcast on 93.3 FM (now KQBU-FM) under the current call sign in 1980, owned and operated by Steve Hicks.  Its studios are located southeast of the I-10/US 69 interchange in Beaumont, and its transmitter is located in Vidor, Texas.\n\nHistory\nThe FCC allocated 95.1 facility in Beaumont received an initial License to Cover on November 27, 1961 as KHGM, owned by Gerald Proctor under the entity of Woodland Broadcasting Company. The facility is currently owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.\n\nFor many years, KYKR was located at 93.3 FM, which had first begun as KCAW-FM, the FM companion to 1510 KCAW Port Arthur and owned by Jimmie Joynt. Jimmie sold the station when he moved to Dallas to start Superior Broadcast Products. The KYKR call was issued to 93.3 in 1980 and was owned by the Hicks family of Beaumont (Steve Hicks most notably of CapStar; his father, John Hicks, had owned 560 KLVI since the 1960s) and was moved to the 2000 ft. tower in Devers in 1991 after Steve Hicks had purchased this facility. 93.3 was then sold to Tichenor Media, now Univision, resulting in the KYKR calls and format being permanently moved to this frequency.\n\nThis was possible as a result of then Top 40/CHR station \"B95\" KZZB going silent at 7 p.m. on November 26, 1991, prompting Gulfstar to purchase the 95.1 signal and ultimately place KYKR's country format on it, and then selling 93.3 to Tichenor Media, which began targeting Houston with the new signal that had just been rebuilt in Devers. 93.3 and 95.1 simulcasts briefly before the latter frequency became KYKR's full-time home in the summer of 1992.\n\nKYKR achieved some of its greatest ratings and revenue success from 1999 to 2009 under the direction of program director Mickey Ashworth.

        "Why is the rum gone? \"WHY IS THE RUM GONE?!\" As if the seven wonders of the world were no match to this man who, born boy genius, was never met with an obstacle of the mind, and posed his entire lack of ignorance into one question, he screamed. He screamed until he sobbed and he sobbed until he could see the color red in the back of his throat. Why is the rum gone? He noticed and decided to ignore the items immediately next to him. Knife. Rope. Matches. Paper. Nothing mattered. Nothing matters. The rum was gone. Why is the rum gone? In a flash of rage he picked up the bottle, stood up, and attempted to smash it against the sand, using his entire body and thrusting it over his head. Instead, it bounced, unharmed, and made the same noise one would hear when blowing into an empty glass bottle. Sand? He hadn't noticed the sand much like he hadn't noticed his whereabouts or his predicament. \"What the fuck?\" what the fuck? Turning around in circles, he began attempting to locate himself. I'm at the beach! Turning around again, he saw the most textbook picture of a jungle imaginable and decided he wasn't at the beach. The water met where the sand ended only a couple hundred feet from where he stood and he decided he was on an island. It didn't matter anyway. It doesn't matter. The rum was gone. Why is the rum gone? For 30 days the search party tried to find him but those who knew him were not fearful. After all, he was a genius, and the life craft he had drifted on was carrying emergency survival gear. For 30 days, he had laid dormant. Nothing mattered. The rum was gone. Rum was the fuel to his fire. Rum was the sole purpose for living, or in his case surviving. What point was there to persevere in the absence of rum? None. And so he did not. But on the 31st day, the helicopters gained sight of the tiny island and called a team on the water to search. The team on the water raided the island like they were at war, and there, in the sand, he lay. Cold to the touch, he had been died the night before and next to him lay the rope, the knife, the matches, and the bottle of rum, only it wasn't empty. Inside was a scrap of paper he had written in with a stick dipped in his blood and it read, \"There was no rum left.\"",
        "\"Clarissa!\" he yelled hoarsely but she didn't hear, \"Clarissa\" he repeated, voice straining, but it was useless. Everything was changing again. John hurried forwards through the street trying to focus on the retreating figure. New York looked just as he'd remembered only the colours were just off, a little too bright giving it all a surreal edge. Central park looked beautiful in the autumn sun though he barely had time to register it all as he followed her into it. His heart was in his throat and though he could never physically tire any more, he'd found the dreaming was wearing on him mentally and if he didn't focus hard enough he'd be lost in the shared psychosphere like an errant thought eternally adrift. The sky was loosing it's definition. Orange sunset was morphing into swells of rainbow starbursts that reminded him of the Arctic lights that..... he was cold and it was night and he fell ungraciously in a heap amongst the snow-drifts. John coughed and raised himself slowly, feeling the chill bite of the winds and fumbled for his torch. It was so dark out here and the others would be waiting for him, overhead the northern lights played a magnificent display of colour..... of colour that..... John stared at his hands. This wasn't right was it? He could hear the others calling to him to hurry up, they were going to lose the race if he didn't- His left hand was gloveless. He stared at it feeling terribly confused but felt his eyes focus on one thing, a symbol, a twisted circle, the symbol of infinity tattooed to his thumb that- \"Clarissa\" he mumbled, remembering. The snow around him started to melt away, dissolving and morphing. Clarissa. Focus. When he opened his eyes he was in the park again. Focus John begged himself, to let his mind wonder would mean losing her again and his heart ached so very much. Standing up he found himself next to a small pond and saw the figure sitting on the bench, soaking up the sun. She had her eyes closed and for a moment he admired that perfectly sculpted face as beautiful as he'd ever imagined. He settled into the seat slowly and watched her eyes fling open, those emeralds shining at him happily as she leant over and gave him a peck then hugged him. He savoured the embrace and, despite himself, cried. She pulled back in alarm. \"What's the matter\" she asked, \"I've been waiting for your for aaaages\" she said with a confused laugh. John looked around, remembering this day, and he laughed too, wiping away his tears. \"I know\" he replied, \"I was looking for you for a long time.\"",
        "Umberto Puppini (16 August 1884, Bologna – 21 May 1946, Bologna) was a minister of the Italian government in the 1930s and a professor of hydraulic engineering.\n\nPuppini grew up as an orphan in poverty, but thanks to financial support from the city of Bologna he was able to study engineering and received his laurea in 1908 from the University of Bologna. There he became in the school of hydraulic engineering an assistant in 1908 and a libero docente in 1912. During WW I he was an officer in the artillery corps. After the war, he returned to the University of Bologna and became in hydraulic engineering a professor extraordinarius in 1920 and a professor ordinarius in 1923.  From 1927 to 1932 he was director of the school of engineering (Scuola di Applicazione). After the fascist rise to power he was elected as a pro-fascist mayor of Bologna, before the fascist law of 4 February 1926 replaced the elected office of mayor with a fascist-appointed office of mayor. Replacing Costanzo Ciano, he was Undersecretary at the Ministry of Agriculture from 20 June to 30 August 1943. He was then the Minister of Communications from 30 April 1934 to 23 January 1935. He was also president of Agip. During WW II he withdrew from politics and devoted himself to research.

        "Lon Snowden told journalists in Moscow he felt \"extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free.\" He later met his son, local media say. Edward Snowden was granted asylum in Russia in August after weeks spent in a transit zone at Moscow airport when the US revoked his travel documents. The 30-year-old leaked many thousands of US intelligence documents. The information, published in The Guardian and Washington Post newspapers, revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by both US and British intelligence. In the US, Edward Snowden faces charges of theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. Meanwhile, Edward Snowden met four former US security officials in Russia late on Wednesday, it has emerged. The officials - who now campaign against what they describe as the misuse of state secrecy - said they had presented Mr Snowden with the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence award. The award is given annually by a group of retired CIA officers. The officials told Russian media Mr Snowden had no regrets about leaking the classified files and was convinced he had done the right thing. \"He's remarkably centred,\" ex-FBI agent Coleen Rowley told state-funded RT television. 'Legal options' Lon Snowden, arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on Thursday, was met by his son's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena. \"I'm here to learn more about my son's situation,\" Mr Snowden told reporters. \"My hope is to learn more about his circumstances and his health and to discuss legal options.\" \"If the opportunity presents itself, I certainly hope that I have the opportunity to see my son,\" he said in televised remarks. \"I'm not sure that my son will be returning to the US. That's his decision, he's an adult.\" Lon Snowden later visited his son, but the place and time of the meeting \"are not being been revealed for security reasons,\" said Russia's state-run TV channels Rossiya 24 and Channel One. Lon Snowden has in the past praised his son for speaking \"the truth\" and making great sacrifices, and has spoken of his concern that he would not face a fair trial if he returned to the US. Edward Snowden accessed many of the documents while working for the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii, where he had been living with his girlfriend. As the revelations became public, Mr Snowden fled to Hong Kong where, with his consent, The Guardian revealed his identity in June. To escape US attempts to extradite him, Mr Snowden moved on to Russia where he remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until Russia granted him asylum. Russia's move added to already tense relations with the US. Washington cancelled a bilateral summit in September.",
        "Inside the grocery store, I feel like shit. I can feel the headache come on stronger than ever, the one that comes when I don't have a drink in more than a few hours. As I reach the shelf with vodka, I hear a voice that sends a shiver down my spine. \"Kitten, come on.\" I turn and see my mother, except she is much younger. My eyes begin to tear up as the woman stares beyond me, and I realize she isn't speaking to me. But she only called me Kitten, I don't understand. Suddenly I feel something run beside me. I look down and see me, my own face, but I am much younger. They walk away, and I lean back against the shelf. As I collect myself, I grab the bottle of vodka from the shelf and make my way to the counter. I begin to question if this is another withdrawal symptoms, or if all these years of substance abuse has finally gotten to me. As I walk out of the store, I can see them running to the car. The same car my mother owned, the same scratch on the passenger door from when my dad hit the mailbox with the car the day my mother left him. What have I become? I live in a rundown house and I pay for my rent with money I earn by stealing and scamming people. I am my own mother. I shake my head, and my eyes fix in something on the ground; it's my doll, the 1991 Holiday Barbie. I begged my mother for that doll, and she sat up crying when I told her I would hate her forever if she didnt buy me it. I knew it was expensive, but I didn't know what money was, and I didn't understand why we had to live in the car in the middle of winter, just before school returned from winter break, and everyone asked me why my mother's car was filled with clothing and junk, and why I didn't throw slumber parties at my house. I lost that doll many years ago, shortly after I got it. I think about all this, and wonder if by changing the life of this younger me, I could change my future. There was only one way to find out. I know where my mother used to park the car for the night, a spit where the police wouldn't find us and weird people couldn't bother us. It was only a few miles from here, and yes, it is a longshot. But I have a plan...",
        "Stella has spent a number of years travelling to a variety of countries, working as a nanny and teaching French to children. Her latest job has taken her to Saudi Arabia. \"I've shot neon in a lot of locations,\" says Stella. \"But it's the way it is used in Saudi which interested me the most. Partly because of the way it looks aesthetically in that environment - the empty roads and pitch-black desert sky give it a very stark appearance, and partly because, as Saudi friends have explained to me, it has a real cultural significance there. \"Light is very spiritually important, but we also forget that it's a very young country - within any family, you'll have older generations who remember a time before they even had electricity. So now that it's arrived, there's a real love for, and status attached to, this kind of artificial light. \"It feels more powerful in a country which is predominantly open desert - it's pitch dark in a lot of Saudi at night, with these vast, beautiful skies. In that environment, a neon light travels a huge distance and feels very powerful. It's like a modern version of the campfire.\" Stella is self-taught, having been given a camera for her 30th birthday - but she notes that once she starts to photograph a subject, she usually keeps going until she can get it out of her system before moving on to something new. And once she had noticed the neon, she set about taking lots of pictures. \"I was asking my driver in Saudi about it, and he liked the idea of my project so agreed to drive me around in the evening,\" she says. \"I had a break when the people I worked with went for their meal to break the fast during Ramadan, so the streets were pretty empty. \"That suited me, because I was more interested in looking at the actual physical geography of the place. So we went out every night, drove around until I saw something which looked right, and then we shot very quickly - there was no real set-up or off-camera lighting. It was just a case of me getting out of the car, shooting, then getting back in.\" Stella was also keen to avoid what she sees as the visual cliches people often fall into when photographing the country. She says: \"I felt really lucky that I got to travel there and see it. I wanted to take pictures which captured how I felt when I was there, and the neon did that. I hope the photos give other people an insight into what the real country behind the headlines is like as well.\" NOUR by Celine Stella is published by No UFOs.

        "\"You want me to do WHAT?\" The knight was incredulous. He tried to restrain his voice, lest his majesty be offended, but the king had clearly lost his mind. \"I believe you heard me correctly Sir Caradoc. I wish you to retrieve the dragon recently kidnapped - well, dragonnapped I suppose, by Princess Lynette, and I wish you to leave the Princess alive. Her father might still be suffering from madness, but an act as definitive as that could incite an all out war.\" This was a terrifying prospect for the kingdom, they had long enjoyed peace with the neighbouring kingdom of Anatolia, but with Lynette's father succumbing more and more to insanity each day, it seemed that the young princess was now making a play for power. \"But Sire \"Sir Caradoc. \" The great king's voice bristling with impatience, \" I have received news that our neighbouring kingdom has acquired a dragon, and may well intend to use it against us. Are you the man for this task, or do I have to send a raven for Lancelot again?\" Caradoc sighed. He had been hoping for a chance to restore his reputation after Lancelot had greased his saddle, causing him to be unseated and thrown to the floor before the joust had even begun, making him look, as sir Galahad had so eloquently put it, \"a right tit.\" With Lancelot away, the tale of defeating the princess who stole a dragon would make for a good story at court. \" You can count on me sire. \" The king's manner became jovial once more as he tried to throw his arm around the knight's shoulders, only for the pauldron on his armour to get in the way. He gave up and beckoned the young knight forward. \" Why don't you take young Tristram here with you? He could use a little worldly experience. \" The king leaned his great frame in even closer and whispered conspiratorially, \" dragon fodder... \" Tristram was known throughout the castle as possibly the worst jester in the land. He had on multiple occasions injured himself whilst trying to perform acrobatic feats, and had been banned from juggling knives for the safety of others. He had been encouraged by the king to continue practicing, but only in a room containing only himself, but was yet to cause himself the kind of injury his majesty had hoped. Whilst bringing accidental death or injury to the lad would please his master, Caradoc decided against it. He was more likely to be injured by the oaf himself than the dragon. To be continued.",
        "\"Whole world went to shit, that's what happened!\" bellowed Old Jim, scowling as he spoke, each word practically spat at the children circled before him. \"Don't know how or why it happened..... maybe we got complacent, maybe we got stupid but everyone was clammerin' over everyone else, itching to look the most'moral', the most'progressive' and suddenly, BAM!,\" the kids startled, \"We had a four hundred pound female president who thought she was a unicorn.\" Jim's expression grew distant as he eased back in his chair, taking a puff of his peculiarly phallus shaped cigar. \"It didn't take long, then, and people started disappearin'. First it was just the manliest of us, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, those tennis playing Williams sisters, poof, gone. Never heard from'em again.\" Jim leaned in and blew smoke out in lazy clouds towards the children, just to be a dick. \"Then they came for the rest of us...\" Jim lifted the sleeve on his tattered khaki fatigues, exposing a brutal, misshapen brand that spoke well of the pain it would have caused to make it. He made sure each of the children got a good, long look at it. \"They separated us via'privilege'. Branded us in a manner befitting our standing, they said.\" Jim looked as his own brand, \"Don't much look like a penis, though...\" \"What happened next, Old Jim?!\" piped up one of the kids, familiar face on him. Jim reckoned he might have been one of his own. \"Shut it, you little shit. I'm talking here.\" he replied, then sat silent for a moment. \"You kids ever seen the dogs..... wrestlin'?\" he asked, not sure of the phrasing. \"Like when Rex plays leapfrog with Jessie?.\" Little shit spoke again. \"Yeppa, like that. Vital step if you want to get puppies, you know, vital. That's the problem.\" \"They didn't like dogs?\" \"Dogs, what?, no you moron..... babies! That's the problem. They got rid of all the cocks and in their grand mansions of delusion and self importance grew old and bitter..... well, more bitter, and alone. Grim claimed them all and they had no-one to pass on their legacy. We, on the other hand, us men and the right thinking women who were still women, we got..... you. At the end of the day, it wasn't guns, or jets, or bombs that won us back our country...\" Jim stood, dropped his trousers and stood proud, proud as any man before or since. \"It was this!\"",
        "Infrared (IR), sometimes called infrared light, is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with wavelengths longer than those of visible light. It is therefore invisible to the human eye. IR is generally understood to encompass wavelengths from around 1 millimeter (300 GHz) to the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum, around 700 nanometers (430 THz).[verification needed] Longer IR wavelengths (30 μm-100 μm) are sometimes included as part of the terahertz radiation range. Almost all black-body radiation from objects near room temperature is at infrared wavelengths. As a form of electromagnetic radiation, IR propagates energy and momentum, exerts radiation pressure, and has properties corresponding to both those of a wave and of a particle, the photon.\nIt was long known that fires emit invisible heat; in 1681 the pioneering experimenter Edme Mariotte showed that glass, though transparent to sunlight, obstructed radiant heat. In 1800 the astronomer Sir William Herschel discovered that infrared radiation is a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light, by means of its effect on a thermometer. Slightly more than half of the energy from the Sun was eventually found, through Herschel's studies, to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared. The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has an important effect on Earth's climate.\nInfrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when changing rotational-vibrational movements. It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment, making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry. Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range.\nInfrared radiation is used in industrial, scientific, military, commercial, and medical applications. Night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected. Infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds, to detect objects such as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe. Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect the overheating of electrical components.\nMilitary and civilian applications include target acquisition, surveillance, night vision, homing, and tracking. Humans at normal body temperature radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10 μm (micrometers). Non-military uses include thermal efficiency analysis, environmental monitoring, industrial facility inspections, detection of grow-ops, remote temperature sensing, short-range wireless communication, spectroscopy, and weather forecasting.",
        "First , we should clear up the misconception that evolution can favors specific traits . By definition , evolution is ambidirectional , which partially accounts for the wide diversity of life we see on the planet . Evolution does not particularly favor animals who breathe oxygen or breakdown food for energy [ chemotrophs ] . Natural selection , however , tends to select for creatures who have enough energy in reserve to escape from predators so they can live long enough to reproduce . Oxygen , comes into play here because it allows for a fast method to convert the chemical molecules [ sugar , protein , fats ] from food into high - energy , readily available molecules [ ATP ] which can be used at a moments notice or stored . Oxygen is used as the final high - energy [ electron ] acceptor in a cyclic process which originally converts sugar [ glucose ] into a highly unstable , high - energy molecule [ NADH , FADH2 ] , which is then used to form a more stable high - energy molecule [ ATP ] . * * How can one high - energy molecule release energy ? * * In the general sense , when a molecule at high energy suddenly drops to a lower energy state , the difference in that energy is released into the environment [ the mitochondria ] via sub - particles [ electrons ] which are able to do work . The step - wise transfer of these sub - particles to oxygen allows for the * simultaneous co - creation * of a stable high - energy molecule [ ATP ] . It is this creation of the high - energy ATP molecule and its subsequent usage that allows animals to engage in high - energy activities such as running , hunting , and reproducing . * * So why Oxygen ? * * It is important to note that this oxygen to ATP cycle occurs at a very fast rate and produces many ATP molecules per molecule of sugar . If we did not use oxygen , we would have to use a more primitive [ and slower ] method to acquire the high - energy molecules [ fermentation ] . This second method can be done without the presence of oxygen , however , its ATP yield is virtually negligible * ( In essence , it 's ATP yield is 0 and only serves to regenerate an important intermediate ) * . Therefore , if we were being chased by a predator , this second method would not produce high - energy molecules at a rate fast enough to allow us to escape , and we would be eaten . If predators kill off members of the species at a faster rate than they can reproduce , the species will eventually go extinct along with their genes pool . This explains why using oxygen [ oxidative phosphorylation ] has been selected for in large animals .",
        "In my view there are two big ways to think about this , ( and one small one ) First , that flat design is a trend . It 's popular and on \" the cutting edge \" of design at the moment , and since many of the hottest apps and websites are beginning to use that style , if you use it as well you take on the appearance of being \" modern \" and \" trendy \" . The small idea is that making things look physical on interfaces require images or processing ( think about asking a computer to render a drop shadow on a textured image ) , so it is more efficient if things are flat and can be shown using code only . However , there is also an idea of \" embracing true digital design \" , or rather , not relying on old physical analogies to accomplish tasks in a digital space . Think about a switch in an application , it turns something on and off . To make sure users easily understand its function , you can design it to look exactly like switches they use in the real world ( example : light switch ) . They 've used those before and are familiar with how they work , so designing them with textures and shadows to look close to the real world counterpart will bring comfort to the user and easily explain the function . Even a more abstract version , one that does n't have textures or look exactly like a switch , would still rely on shadows and certain movements to mimic the physical counterpart . But now , we 've progressed where users are familiar with using digital interfaces . People use multiple devices and multiple interfaces throughout their day , and designers are starting to look at interaction and design anew . On a screen , in a digital space , how would you accomplish that same task ? What would a ' digital first ' switch look like , and even further , how would it interact ? Perhaps a switch is n't even the best interaction , perhaps a gesture or a swipe is ? ( think of any interface in a sci - fi movie like Minority Report , with grand hand gestures on a floating screen ) . In many ways the flattening of design is the decision of designers to not be bound by how things look and function in the physical world , and to think about what a user 's interaction with the digital space will be . That could represent an evolution in design and interaction , which would very much be modern thinking . That explanation may be a little too ambitious , in many ways it 's just taking a physical looking switch and reducing it to lines and boxes . But , there is some interesting depth to this recent ' modern ' take on design and how we 'll start to interact with the digital space .",

        "Blaming institutions for economic \"struggles\" seems to be a commonplace today. There are many people in my field of study, economics, that think correct policy can restore the US economy back to, and sustain 4 GDP growth. Total output (GDP) is generally though to be the product of total factor productivity (TFP), labor, and capital. TFP is typically what drives growth within an economy. It represents the efficiency of labor and capital, which is primarily driven by technology (i.e. the internet allowed labor to be more productive through increase communication and other things.) The law of diminishing marginal returns would dictate that when more labor and capital are added to the economy, they will provide less benefit (output) than those before them. This could be a reason for the majority of newly created jobs being low quality, but I digress. The main reason for my view is the nature of TFP. Productivity is the ratio of what is produced to what is required to produce it. TFP has increased significantly over the last century as a result of the internet, transportation, communication, etc. In general, this increase in TFP is the primary reason for the fast GDP growth over that time period. Say that in 1950, 100 workers and 100 machines were required to make 100 units of output. 1970: 85 workers and 85 machines can now produce 100 units of output because of an increase in TFP. 1990: 60 workers and 60 machines 100 units of output 2010: 25 workers and 25 machines 100 units of output (Output is a very loosely defined term in this context) My view: If we look at TFP as efficiency on a scale from 0-100, I would argue that over the last century or so we went from 10 to 90 (using broad and probably inaccurate numbers here but the principle remains.) This increase of 80 is what has allowed our economy to grow at such a fast rate, and it is simply not possible for us to continue growing anywhere near that rate going forward unless there is another internet like discovery. Paired with diminishing returns to labor and capital, the fact that TFP can't improve as much as it has leads me to the conclusion the our economy growth will continue to plateau. Eventually (maybe soon, or already) our population growth will outpace our economic growth, which means there will be less \"stuff\" available for each person, and standard of living will inevitably decline. Similar to Jeffery Lacker, I think that the financial crisis in 2008 was a structural realization and the 1.5-2 growth that we have been seeing since then is what we should expect going forward and we (the Fed, consumers, government, etc) should tailor our expectations going forward. I only have a bachelors degree in economics so if I'm off base hopefully someone more knowledgeable can set me straight.",
        "Some premises I hold to be true (feel free to CMV on these): - Emotion and Logic are at opposite ends of the same spectrum: any decision we make is at one end, or a combination of either considered, consequence-focussed judgements; or just going with whatever makes us feel best now - A positive emotional outcome is a logical target: making a decision based on which will bring the most net happiness to ourselves is a perfectly valid option - Humans are ultimately emotional: at some threshold we will always give in to our emotions, however illogical they are I've always lived my life by these principles - always striving for logical decisions and doing what's in my best long term interest. I've always differentiated myself from those who indulge in making short-sighted, emotional decisions that give them no long term payoff. Attempting to live logically is problematic But I've come to a few realisations over the past few days. Although I've long been aware that as a human it's impossible to be purely logical, I've come to see that striving for logic is an impossible target. And constantly failing to hit that target is defeating, demoralising and anxiety-inducing. But some thinking later, I got even further. Even if it were possible to be logical all the time, this necessitates denying your emotions: good and bad. Which means that I'd always be choosing decisions that don't make me happy. Living logically requires that I feel unhappy with my life. And even if I'm aiming for some kind of long term happiness (when do I say is a good time to aim for? Next week? When I'm 30, 50, 70, on my deathbed?) I'm constantly denying myself happiness now. What are the alternatives? Which leaves me with indulging in immediate emotional satisfaction, but that brings its own set of problems that I'm sure I don't have to explain to an online community, and the demographic that attracts. It involves potentially ending up somewhere I don't want to be, or unduly hurting the people around me that I care about. I'm aware that this is very black-and-white thinking. EmotionLogic is a spectrum, and it's possible to have a mix of the two. But thinking locically has always been a sort of pseudo role model for me. How is living somewhere in the middle of the spectrum not just a half-assed version of either end of the spectrum? . TL;DR I can either live logically in which case I have to shun my emotional happiness; or live emotionally and have no concern for consequences. I'm unable to know how to reconcile these conflicting alternatives",
        "What a lot of people seem not to realize is that there are * tiers * of government in the United States . Assuming you 're a civilian living in a typical place in the United States — that is , not American Samoa or whatever — you may be within the jurisdiction of as many as five separate democratically or semi - democratically elected governments : the municipality , the township , the county , the state and the union . Certain hard limits are placed on lower tiers by upper tiers , particularly regarding how those lower tiers must respect basic civil rights . For example , it would be unlawful for * any * tier of government in the United States to charge a poll tax during an election . It 's prohibited by law , and if attempted would be challenged in a court of appropriate jurisdiction and overturned . However , within those basic limits , each tier is more or less left at its own discretion to organize itself however it wants , and that includes setting the rules for local elections . As long as those rules do n't violate fundamental principles of law , the individual bodies politic can do * whatever . * If some municipal government somewhere wanted to change its method of electing its mayor from election by ballot to election by acclamation , and the laws of the locally relevant upper tiers of government — meaning the state constitution , basically — did n't expressly prohibit it , they could go right ahead . This even applies to a certain extent to locally run elections which are part of a higher - level process . For instance , each state 's senators are elected by the people of that state — this is set down in the 17th amendment to the US Constitution . But the precise method for holding that election is left to the states … and the states , in turn , may leave it to the lower tiers of government . So when you start talking about changing the fundamental method of election in the United States , you 're kind of talking about a lot . You 're talking about well upwards of 25,000 individual municipal governments , God knows how many civil townships , more than 3,000 counties or equivalent , fifty states and a smattering of non - state territories . Depending on * which of those * you 're talking about , the rules for changing the rules — if you know what I mean — are going to vary . If you 're talking about changing how the town of Hart 's Location , New Hampshire — population 41 ; they had three babies in 2010 — elects its selectmen , you need to convince about two dozen people to agree with you , then you 're done . If you 're talking about how the country as a whole elects a president … well , that 's another kettle of fish entirely .",
        "Just as a disclaimer, I am not about to argue you should stop having sex or that this conclusion should affect society. I am sticking to a simple claim. The one exception I'll make is the continuance of life. I personally am child free but I can understand the point that the continuance of life might be a virtue in itself. I'm not entirely sold on it, but I can understand if you feel this way. Otherwise, I see sex as having so many downsides, and the only upside is momentary pleasure. 1. It drives people in irrational ways. It causes people to use their authority or power inappropriately. It causes people to hurt each other in a spectrum of ways... through callous flings and one night stands or affairs or exploitation and rape. So on so forth. (I'm not saying all flings are hurtful. I'm just saying, in some situations people don't mind hurting each other just to get their desires met). 2. It makes you feel like there is love, when one's own pleasure is the real underlying force. It cloud's people's judgement when they see each other, making them not really see the individual, but just someone that can do something for them. Usually this is very unconscious but is apparent later when people realize they don't really like each other and want to leave the person unless the sex makes it worth staying. Where's the love? Also it may cause the objectification of either gender (treating someone as a thing), the desire to relive or experience something very taboo or traumatic that may in turn traumatize other people who encounter it. And the sex industry is notorious for exploiting and trafficking the poor and unwanted. I could list more but you get the idea. But what good comes of sex? Where does it inspire people to become better people? It only seems to further separate people. As if one needs to \"get\" something out of the other. Where is the desire to freely give and love no matter what the other person is willing to give? Rather I think it makes people self-absorbed and only invested in themselves and sometimes in their partner. I also would hesitate to even call sex hedonistic. As hedonism is the desire to make oneself happy over time... does sex even accomplish this? It is a momentary high which is followed by a sharp decrease in dopamine levels, and some claim it might even deplete them over time. In many old religions sex was thought to further one from the connection to God. Some religions claimed that engaging sex decreased one's life force. I feel like it is something that is so hard to stop wanting that we do everything possible to justify our pining for it. However, why don't we say it like it is? We'd be a lot better off without sex or maybe even our desire for sex. Please CMV.",

Taxpayers are considered “traveling away from home” if their duties   require them to be away from home substantially longer than an   ordinary day’s work and they need to sleep or rest to meet the demands   of their work. The actual cost of meals and incidental expenses may be   deducted or the taxpayer may use a standard meal allowance and reduced   record keeping requirements. Regardless of the method used, meal   deductions are generally limited to 50 percent as stated earlier.    Only actual costs for lodging may be claimed as an expense and   receipts must be kept for documentation. Expenses must be reasonable   and appropriate; deductions for extravagant expenses are not   allowable. More information is available in Publication 463, Travel,   Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses. Entertainment Expenses for entertaining clients, customers or employees may be   deducted if they are both ordinary and necessary and meet one of the   following tests: Directly-related test: The main purpose of the entertainment activity is the conduct of business, business was actually conducted   during the activity and the taxpayer had more than a general   expectation of getting income or some other specific business benefit   at some future time.   Associated test: The entertainment was associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer’s trade or business and occurred directly   before or after a substantial business discussion. Publication 463 provides more extensive explanation of these tests as   well as other limitations and requirements for deducting entertainment   expenses. Gifts Taxpayers may deduct some or all of the cost of gifts given in the   course of their trade or business. In general, the deduction is   limited to $25 for gifts given directly or indirectly to any one   person during the tax year. More discussion of the rules and   limitations can be found in Publication 463. If your LLC reimburses you for expenses outside of this guidance it should be treated as Income for tax purposes. Edit for Meal Expenses: Amount of standard meal allowance.   The standard meal allowance is   the federal M&IE rate. For travel in 2010, the rate for most small   localities in the United States is $46 a day. Source IRS P463 Alternately you could reimburse at a per diem rate",
        "The interim report into Integrated Care 24 (IC24), which runs non-emergency 111 and out-of-hours services in Norfolk and Wisbech, found deficiencies in call handling and a shortage of GPs. During unannounced inspections following complaints, staff said they had been asked to alter their records. IC24 said it had addressed the issues. The organisation operates NHS 111 services in areas including Great Yarmouth and Waveney and parts of Essex, and took over the Norfolk and Wisbech contract in September 2015. Assessors from Norwich Clinical Commissioning Group (NCCG) inspected five IC24 bases in Norfolk and one in Cambridgeshire in November following staff complaints. Their report highlighted issues including: In October last year, IC24's interim chief executive said the organisation was still struggling to fill shifts. A month later, Norwich resident Peter Rowley said he called 111 but waited 11 hours for a call back, eventually going to AE instead. Read more on this and other stories from Norfolk The company apologised, but said it had followed procedures. Karen Watts, who wrote the interim report into IC24, concluded it was \"not clinically assured of the safety of the OOH [out-of-hours] service\" and only \"partially assured\" of the 111 service. She said the CCG believed the issues identified were having a \"negative impact on recruitment and retention of the existing workforce.\" Ms Watts also demanded IC24 provide a detailed improvement action plan by the beginning of December. The BBC asked to see the improvement plan, and whether concerns highlighted in the report had been sufficiently addressed, but both NCCG and IC24 declined to answer, instead sending a joint statement. NCCG spokesman Tim Curtis said the organisation had been \"very encouraged with IC24's response.\" Yvonne Taylor, IC24 chief executive, said: \"As an open organisation, I would like to reassure our patients that we continue to work with our commissioners to provide a robust and transparent service for our patients.\" Both organisations said: \"There were no deaths that we know of which can be attributable to the long waits.\" The NCCG has been asked to share the outcomes of its investigation so they could be examined by a health committee, a Norfolk County Council spokeswoman said. Tony Durcan from the Royal College of Nursing said it had \"sought reassurances that measures had been put in place to address the worrying points raised by the leaked report.\" Dr Tim Morton, chairman of Norfolk and Waveney Local Medical Committee, said IC24's problems were \"a consequence of a severe workforce crisis within the NHS in recruiting and retaining GPs.\" NHS 111Out-of-hours care",
        "Hello, 1980s! Stepping into Shun Lee Palace is like stepping back in time. The colors of Mauve and Hunter Green abound in the decor. And lets not forget the swivel chairs. We went on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. Like someone else mentioned in their review, it was mostly an older crowd. (Perhaps they've been there since the 80s?) It took quite some time before we were greeted by our server and quite a time longer before she returned to take our orders. I like to think that I know my way around a Chinese restaurant, but there were dishes on the menu with which I was not familiar. And, unfortunately, there were no descriptions. Tai Chi? Tung Ann? New Tze? Flower Chicken? Royal Chicken? Peacock Chicken? I asked our server about two of them, but didn't want to ask any further and went with Sa Cha Chicken because I knew I had had it someplace once before. The food came out as it was made. First, two (of five) dinners were brought out, one of which had to be taken back because it was wrong. Then that second one returned with the correct entree. Then a third dinner came out. And then finally, the fourth and fifth together. The food was enjoyable, but a bit on the bland side. If my entree has a little mark next to it because it's spicy, I want it spicy. Unfortunately, it wasn't. And there was nothing on the table to doctor it up. Everything tasted very fresh, though, so kudos for that. And the kids' entrees were pretty big, so they were a good value. I'm wary of Chinese restaurants that don't automatically offer you chopsticks. I like chopsticks. I like to eat Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and sushi dinners with chopsticks. It adds to the experience. Since we rarely saw our server, I didn't even bother to ask for a pair. Maybe there was a shortage in the 1980s? I'm sure some people have been going to Shun Lee Palace since they decorated in the 1980s and love it. I, for one, have experienced much better. Much, MUCH better. Atmosphere is a big deal for me. Shun Lee didn't have it, so we won't be going back. p.s. What's up with the clothing rack in the dining room? You might think it was for people to hang their coats; however, you'd be wrong. Apparently it's a rack where the employees can hang their street clothes up during their shifts. (Because I doubt that anyone took off their T-shirts at dinner because they were too hot.) Tres tacky.",
        "I was treated like I was special the second I was born. 1. The last of the children born on Earth, to a middle-class family in the heart of New York. I was supposed to be the talisman, the last hope for humanity. I was supposed to lead us into the stars and break the genetic disease that ravaged our planet. I was supposed to find a cure and make it possible to continue the human race again. So the prophecy foretold, in that huge book held deep within the vaults of the UN Building, the last surviving testament the Great Leader himself. I was supposed to be the second coming of him, he who had found the disease eating our DNA, he who had brought the world together under one almighty, omniscient umbrella. I was supposed to be him incarnate once again. Time went by and I failed at every turn. I was reviled. I couldn't do math well enough; anatomy confused me. How was I supposed to find a cure for the disease when I couldn't even name the parts of a cell? Riots ensued. \"We're all going to die! Humanity is doomed!\" My parents and the few advisers that remained to keep them safe tried their hardest to educate me, to let me fulfill my destiny. They tried to save the human race. The crowds got Dad first. When they came, in the middle of the night on Halloween, my parents thought it was the last two kids in New York besides myself, trick-or-treating despite the fact that they were almost fifteen each. They shot Dad in the chest, for producing the doom of humanity. Mom screamed and Dr. Evans shouted for us to run. Dr. Muller went with us while Evans held the back door against the mob. We ran for two weeks in Mom's sedan, keeping me hidden from view. I wasn't allowed to leave the back seat, and I couldn't take off my sweatshirt, even in the middle of Texas. It was only after the miracle birth of 0 that we were safe. From the deep jungle of the Amazon came the true Inheritor of the Great Leader. She cracked the disease by the time she was 5. She gave humanity it's first commercial space fleet and colonies by 10. By 15, she was granted the title of Queen of Earth. And me? I will always be remembered as the Great Failure. The Great Pretender. The Church of the Queen still wants me hung for being the false Chosen One. So I had no choice. I ran. Into the depths of space, I ran. Somewhere, lost out in the stars, where no one could find me, where no one could look at that permanent scar on my wrist, that horrible 1.

        "Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, United States. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and, as of June 2022[update], is the world's biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by  Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching \"Think different\" and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then $2 trillion in August 2020, and most recently $3 trillion in January 2022. The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It is ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.",
        "His meetings will focus on the relationship between the UK and Russia, as well as issues involving Syria and Ukraine \"where we continue to have significant differences,\" it said. The Foreign Office said the UK \"will engage with Russia where it is in our national interest to do so.\" The timings and details of the visit will be released \"in due course.\" A spokeswoman said: \"The foreign secretary has accepted an invitation from Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to visit Moscow in the coming weeks. \"The prime minister and the foreign secretary have made clear that our policy towards Russia is to'engage but beware' and the visit is entirely consistent with this approach. \"This is not a return to business as usual and the foreign secretary will continue to be robust on those issues where we differ.\" A Foreign Office source insisted that the visit did not signal any shift in UK policy towards Russia. \"He is not going in order to reset the relationship. He has been clear in his calls with Lavrov that this can't happen till they change course on issues such as Ukraine. \"He intends to say the same things face to face as we do in public and in Parliament about Russian activities. While it may be a tough visit, that is what needs to be done.\" The source added: \"Boris has always said we must engage when in our interests. He calls it'guarded engagement'. He will be robust in the meetings and defend our position. This is not about cosying up, in fact quite the opposite.\" Mr Johnson's trip will see him become the first minister to travel to Moscow for an official visit in more than five years. On a visit to Kiev last week, the foreign secretary said Russia's annexation of Crimea was illegal and insisted that it should be returned to Ukraine. He has also said there was no case for relaxing sanctions against Russia until it abided by the Minsk peace agreement. Mr Johnson has been hugely critical of Russia recently, accusing it of engaging in \"dirty tricks\" such as cyber attacks. The Russian embassy in London has responded by accusing him of trying to reopen the Cold War. Speaking in Germany last month, Mr Johnson told the BBC: \"You have got to engage with Russia, but you have got to engage in a very guarded way. You have got to beware of what they are up to. \"There is no question that, when you look at Russian activity on the cyber front, when you look at what they are doing in the western Balkans, when you look at what has been happening in the Ukraine, you've got to be very, very cautious. \"I think it is entirely right to have a dual track approach. We don't want to get into a new Cold War.\"",
        "As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath. Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic. Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the \"warm glow\" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future. Further information: Examples of diseases or ailments.

        "(United States) Slightly relevant information: The United States has no federal legislation specifically addressing human genetic modification (either germline and somatic). However, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act have been interpreted as providing sufficient authority for federal health agencies to regulate research on human genetic modification. Federal oversight for human genetic modification is characterized by the existence of numerous and often overlapping regulatory reviews required by local and federal agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Recombinant In addition to the abovementioned legislation, all institutions receiving federal funds must comply with federal rules regarding the protection of human subjects in medical research. These rules also apply to research conducted pursuant to an investigational new drug application (IND) or to support an application for a new drug or biological product. Following international standards, key aspects of the federal regulations are a review of research protocols by an Institutional Review Board, informed consent by research subjects, and periodic reporting Relevant information: that the current ban on federal funding of embryo research seemingly prohibits conducting germline genetic modification interventions. Others argue that the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) would have to assert jurisdiction over such research protocols in order for some of this research to be precluded from receiving federal funding. Under the 1996 Dickey-Wicker amendment it is illegal to use federal funds to support research \"in which human embryos are created, destroyed, discarded, or knowingly be subjected to risk of injury or death greater than allowed for research on fetuses in utero under 45 CFR 46.204 and 46.207, and subsection 498 (b) of the Public Health Service Act.\" Moreover, the Dickey-Wicker amendment defines a human embryo as \"any organism, not protected as a human subject under 45 CFR 46 as of the date of enactment of the governing appropriations act, that is derived by fertilization, parthenogenesis, cloning, or any other means from one or more human gametes or human diploid cells.\" Summary: It is essentially illegal and improbable to pursue and administer germline genetic modification to embryos. My view is that not only should it be legal, but that it is immoral to not allow it as an option. Furthermore, I may even take it to the extent that humans are morally obligated to pursue uses of germline genetic engineering for the betterment of the species as a whole. I believe this because all counterarguments (religion, eugenics, equality, caste system, danger, risk, \"designer baby are based on faulty or irrelevant information, and fall short of justifying the ban of a beneficial practice. The practice is beneficial because it saves lives, creates an improved human species (our goal since the beginning), actually increases equality and levels the playing field, and provides long term benefits for the population in general, as well as begins a process that could potentially make the human species overall better.",
        "Edit - thanks for so far a great response!! I am taking a few minutes at work to read through some of these responses and will try to reply. I will also try to reply to more of them this evening. I love this sub...: First of all, I'm not an economist nor have I formally studied economics. So, if I'm really clearly wrong, this should be easy! Also, I'm talking in the context of the US, where the capital gains tax rate is 15 for individuals. Sensational headline aside, I ACTUALLY believe that it's not black and white, and maybe it's ok to adjust the rate somewhat. However, I more am arguing that people (mostly liberalsdemocrats in US politics) are misguided in the idea that increasing the gains tax to stick it to the rich perhaps is a good idea to solve our economic problems. So, my belief is that capital gains tax should be kept \"low\" as much as possible. I believe that keeping the capital gains tax rate low is fundamentally a good thing for our economy, and benefits most of us. A low capital gains tax serves to encourage investment in the economy, which provides capital to companies who, of course, employ many of us. Any policy that reduces investment in the economy and encourages people to hold their money reduces the amount of capital that is actively in the economy, and may reduce productivity, employment etc. With reduced productivity, employment, etc., other corporate and personal income tax revenues would (likely) take a hit, counteracting the whole point of raising the capital gains tax to begin with. On the other hand, encouraging people to basically lend their money into the economy with a very low or non-existent capital gains tax makes the prospect of investing better, as the net profit on any returns is better. This encourages pushing capital into the market, where it will be put to use by firms who actively need it to rungrow their businesses. Many people will argue that for pragmatic purposes, we need to raise more tax revenue and 1) it's best to take it from the rich, not the poor and 2) capital gains are \"lazy\" income. Neither of these arguments will change my view by themselves, so if you wish to go this route you'd better bring numbers to support the idea that raising the capital gains tax would achieve your goals, not just \"fuck the rich.\" Now, I understand that there is some room to increase the tax, which probably won't reduce the amount people invest, so the argument that \"a percent or two won't hurt anything\" won't get a delta, as it's counter to the spirit of my post. Again, it is my opinion that the general preference should be always towards reducing or maintaining a low capital gains tax. CMV!",
        "Ashburn Alley is the open concourse behind center field at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies. It is named after Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn, Phillies center fielder from 1948 to 1959, and was also a long time broadcaster for the Phillies from 1963 until his death in September 1997. Ashburn Alley spans from the left field gate to \"The Yard\" kids area, and features a \"street-fair\" like atmosphere before and during a game.\n\nAshburn Alley's name sake began while Ashburn was still playing. During the Phillies playing days at old Shibe Park, Ashburn was known for dropping bunts down the third baseline, which had slightly overgrown grass that helped the ball stay fair. A bronze statue of Ashburn lies in the center of the alley.\n\nFeatures\n\nAshburn Alley serves as a history lesson of baseball in Philadelphia. Granite markers on the walk-way feature every Phillies all-star since the first game in 1933. Another feature of Ashburn Alley is Memory Lane. Memory Lane is located directly behind the batter's eye, and gives an extensive look at the history of Philadelphia baseball. It features the history of the Phillies, the history of Philadelphia Athletics, and history of Negro league teams in the city. At the end of the Memory Lane section offers a great view of the stadiums' two tiered bullpen. The upper bullpen, in particular, pulls snug against the concourse.\n\nOn the western end of the Alley is Bull's BBQ, named after former Phillies slugger Greg \"The Bull\" Luzinski, who also operates it. Bull's BBQ is an outdoor picnic section and serves barbecue pork sandwiches, chicken, and most notably ribs. Luzinski is at most of the games and often socializes with fans.\n\nOn top of the concession buildings in the center of the Alley is the Rooftop Bleachers. This area of the stadium was influenced by the old rooftop seats at the Phillies and Athletics old home Shibe Park. It was common during the 1920s for residents who lived in the rowhouses across from the ballpark to watch the games for free on their rooftops.\n\nThere are many concession stands featuring Philadelphia cuisine staples such as the cheesesteak, at both Tony Luke's and Campo's. The Alley also features the '47 Brand store, which sells classic Phillies apparel, classic pennants and banners, and other items.\n\nReferences\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nSports in Philadelphia",
        "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the reasons included a rise in the cost of pensioner benefits, and an increase in housing benefit spend. It said Chancellor George Osborne could need to make more spending cuts \"just to stay on track.\" The Treasury said its plan was \"securing a resilient economy.\" The IFS said changes to benefits and tax credits had been expected to save PS19bn compared with \"a world of no policy change.\" Explaining why spending had in fact reduced by PS2.5bn in real terms, it said: \"All this has important fiscal consequences,\" said the report's author, Andrew Hood, adding that slow earnings growth could push up spending. \"Mr Osborne wants further cuts to social security spending to help reduce the deficit. He may end up having to make cuts just to stay on track.\" The IFS study comes after Labour released figures it said showed the government had spent PS25bn more on social security than the amount it had predicted in November 2010. The party commissioned the House of Commons Library to compare forecasts made in the 2010 Autumn Statement with how much the coalition had spent since then and intends to spend this year. Writing on the PoliticsHome website, shadow chancellor Ed Balls and shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said savings from welfare cuts had been outweighed by a failure to tackle the causes of rising social security spending. They wrote: \"A key cause of the Tories' overspending is their failure to make the economy work for working people, leaving thousands more reliant on housing benefit.\" But the Treasury rejected this analysis. A spokesman said: \"The government's long term economic plan is working, cutting the deficit by a third and already delivering over 70 of the PS126bn consolidation set for this Parliament. \"At Budget 2013 we announced a cap on total welfare spending for 2015 to 2016 onwards, bringing over PS100bn of spending under new controls. \"However, the impact of the great recession is still being felt in the economy and public finances, which is why we need to keep working through the plan that's securing a resilient economy.\" Green Party leader Natalie Bennett pointed to a report from the London School of Economics and the University of Essex that said the poorest groups had lost the largest share of their incomes on average as a result of coalition government policies. She said: \"This report once again goes to prove that Osborne's ideologically-driven austerity economics are simply not working.\" The Treasury said analysis of annual budget statements had shown the richest households were \"making the biggest contribution to reducing the deficit.\"",
        "I really get upset when bicyclists ride in the road when a perfectly good sidewalk is available. Im not talking about areas where there are tons of store front and allyways parking lots that are blocked (or not easily visable). So many times I see some one riding on the road in high traffic areas and force everyone to stop slow down or go around some one going 20mph in a 35 or 40mph zone. It ridiculous. - I know its against the law in a lot of places but in most cases the sidewalk is a perfectly fine place to ride that causes no one any inconveniences. I travel a certain road every day that has the highest amount of nonhighway traffic in the area and I always see traffic slow downs caused by people on bikes riding in the road. Theres a perfectly good sidewalk with almost no foot traffic ever. On this same road an entire group of bikers, about 7 or 8, taking an entire lane and barley moving along in a 35mph zone and traffic was backed up as far down the road I could see. - I know people are going to say \"people pulling out of the driveways and businesses arentnlooking at the sidewalk. Thats your job too. They should be, yes, but so should you. - \"the sidewalk is often uneven and bumpy.\" If a sidewalk is extremely dilapidated, sure, I can agree with you. But thats not the case most of the time. - if you cant do the speed limit you shouldnt be on that road. - the vast majority of people on bikes I see never huge the shoulder. - they dont follow normal traffic laws: red lights and stop signs - my bottom line view point: bikes riding in the road in large busy cities with lots of foot traffic and store fronts are fine but other than that should have to ride on sidewalks. If you can use a sidewalk, and dont, I think youre an asshole regardless of whether or not its against the law. Theres no way I would ever be that inconsiderate to hundreds of other people in cars because \"its against the law to ride on a sidewalk\" or you just want to ride in the road because its \"nicer\" and simply because \"you can\" Thats all I can think of at the moment. Edit: with the amount of people texting and talking on phones, why the hell would you wamt to risk being infront of or next to them. Since you have to ride with traffic you cant see the distracted people coming up behind you. If cars are supposed to have insurance for driving on the road, why shouldnt bikes if theyre riding on the road too. They can damage your vehicle by running into it too. If cars are supposed to hsve certain safty features in order to drive why can bicyclists ride without them?",
        "The health board said the man did not access to the woman's medical records. It said the cleaner had got the patient's name from an electronic floor plan at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. The woman visited the accident and emergency department last week for treatment to a hand injury. The next day she was contacted on the social networking site by the man, who said he had been \"checking her out\" while she was being treated in hospital and that he had got her name from the computer. He is also believed to have asked the woman \"how's the hand?.\" The cleaner has been suspended and police are investigating. NHS Lothian conducted its own inquiry and found the cleaner did not manage to access any of the woman's confidential records. The health board's chief operating officer Jackie Sansbury said: \"He had no access to private medical records and information which is protected by a range of complex security systems. \"We understand that this member of contracted staff only gained the patient's name from an electronic screen for staff showing a floor plan in the treatment area of Accident and Emergency Department, in much the same way as a patient's name would be displayed above their bed in a ward area. \"This in no way excuses behaviour of this kind, however, and security messages have been reinforced to our staff and sub-contracted employees to ensure they comply with our data security guidelines. \"Any member of staff who breaks our rules will face investigation under our disciplinary procedures.\" Earlier, Consort, the private company which employs the man, said they were treating the matter very seriously. Lothian and Borders Police said they had received a complaint and were looking into the matter. The woman told The Scotsman newspaper: \"I didn't know who he was, what he was capable of, or whether he also knew my address and telephone number. \"I didn't know if he was just going to turn up at the house. It's just wrong in so many ways. \"I've got two boys at home - one aged two, the other six months - so I was worried for them too.\" Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland that patient confidentiality was of the \"utmost importance.\" She said she could not comment on any individual case, but added: \"Anybody who goes into a hospital as a patient has a right to assume that their data and information will be treated with respect and in the highest confidence. \"I have asked NHS Lothian to ensure that I am made aware of the outcome of their investigation, and any action that requires to be taken as a result of this will be taken.\"",
        "High praises for the attentive service and friendly staff, but that's about it. The experience began with cocktails; a fruit martini tasting almost clinical due its unbalanced high vodka, low fruit ratio, and a Manhattan ordered with'only one or two rocks' served up in a full glass of ice. Two for two thus far. The lobster salad, (Valentine's Day menu) a mountainous pile of frisee with a few small chunks of lobster buried deep within, made for a nice game of hide and seek as I watched my date feverishly pick through the lettuce in search of what little lobster was embedded within. The cedar planked salmon entree was another huge disappointment. A good cedar planked salmon should have the aroma, smoke coloring and caramelization of, well, cedar planked salmon. This was anything but. This salmon, while cooked properly, was tasteless, other than its normal salmon flavor. Now, plop it onto a flat, (non-fluffy pile) wet, soggy serving of cous cous and you've really got a plateful of disappointment. We also ordered the duck, which was delivered roasted and rare. So rare, it was like cutting raw chicken due to it being so flubbery. But again, as I mentioned, the staff was extremely helpful in bringing out a new plate of duck, this instead of the kitchen simply heating up the unwanted serving. After this level of disappointment, desserts were out of the question, but interestingly enough, our server never even offered us to see a dessert menu. How weird is that? It was like he had ESP. Throughout dinner, a woman, (we surmised a floor manager) paced the dining area as if overseeing the staff. Too bad she didn't stop by to inquire how our meal was or if everything was alright. Another disappointment. Ironically, if you read other Yelp reviews of Tanzy, nearly all of them feature a management response, either praising Yelpers for their high marks, or, apologizing for their less than stellar experience. Tanzy, please, there's no need to respond. I don't want an apology, or some lame reason why things weren't the way they should've been. I'm afraid that would be much too little, too late. The time for that was while we were still captive within your domain. What you should do instead is: Gordon Ramsey your Executive Chef. Make the mixologist sample his her creations until they bleed vodka out of their eyes. And finally, have the person frantically pacing the aisles put a smile on her face and actually interface with the patrons, asking about their experience.... seemingly pretending to give a poo.",
        "\"Oh Darling, it was absolutely dreadful!\" Matilda exclaimed in the New York accent. Darling turned from staring out the window and tilted her head. \"I mean Darling they made me wear this horrendous white jumper and no matter how I tried to make it look better they would just give me a plain one the next day!\" She sighed dramatically. Darling twitched her tail from side to side then looked back out the window. \"It was dreadful.\" Matilda stated. \"First I tried tearing off the sleeves and then tearing the bottoms below the knee. But they didn't like that, no, not one bit.\" Darling extended her back leg and started licking the top of it. \"The I tried borrowing some of the Kool Aid packets and dying it. It smelled divine Darling. But they made me change and take a bath!\" Darling hissdd then began grooming her nether regions. \"Then I tried going to the rec room. They were doing painting that day. I spilled a select few colors around the sleeves, trying to make it look like an accident, but they were on to me.\" Darling stretched, sticking her fuzzy bum in the air. \"So then I decided to try and do my hair differently. But when I tried using some shoe strings to tye it up they just chopped it off. I mean look at this bob Darling, it's so distasteful.\" Darling began kneadclawing the carpet. \"Realizing my white jumper was here to stay and that I could now do nothing with my hair I tried rearranging the room. They bolted down my furniture Darling, literally brought the mechanics in and screwed the damn furniture right to the floor!\" Darling began circling around Matilda's legs, her bushy tail brushing against her calves. \"Oh Darling you really are such a good kitty.\" Darling meowed and played with Matilda's shoe string. The image on the screen flickered and the two nurses half-heartedly smiled to one another. \"Isn't it sad how mental illness can take over?\" \"At least we have a former designer who only remembers having a cat.\" \"And a woman who thinks she is one\" \"Isn't it adorable how she uses her arm as a tail?\" \"Argh! I knew we should have put in blinds!\" On the screen Matilda was pulling down a curtain and was exclaiming about how this was the perfect fabric for a new dress. Darling was try to climb the other.",
        "The blanket ban, known as the Criminal Justice Psychoactive Substances Act, was introduced five years ago. Before the law was passed, there were about 100 so-called \"headshops\" selling legal highs across the state, but that number has since been reduced to zero. \"The headshop industry is gone,\" Det Supt Tony Howard told the BBC. He is a member of the Garda (Irish police) Drugs Unit, which has been responsible for enforcing the new legislation. \"We were worried because we saw a whole generation of young people starting to experiment with these new psychoactive substances, and they'd generally be people who wouldn't have otherwise engaged in the misuse of drugs,\" he said. \"They thought it was safe because of the perception that these were legal highs.\" When the blanket ban took effect, it became illegal to advertise, sell, supply, import or export psychoactive substances in the Republic of Ireland. Tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and medicines have been excluded from the ban. Before the legislation came into force, the sale of legal highs appeared to be a very lucrative business. When one Dublin city centre headshop was burnt down in an arson attack, firefighters found a safe in the charred rubble of the building that contained 450,000 euros (PS330,000). As the sale of psychoactive substances was not illegal at the time, police had to hand the cash back to the owner of the safe. As a result of the ban, that would not happen now. Det Supt Howard said many of those who operated the headshops quickly complied with the new law. \"Essentially the industry themselves realised that the legislation was quiet strong and they actually co-operated with us and handed us over any residual product which they had,\" he said. So, should the UK follow the Irish government's lead and outlaw legal highs? It may have taken the headshops out of the high street but not everyone believes the ban is the most effective way to protect drug users. Tony Duffin, director of the Ana Liffey Drug Project in Dublin said there was still \"huge harm\" associated with the substances formally sold by headshops. He said many recreational users are now buying psychoactive substances over the internet instead, and more regular users just go to drug dealers. \"I'm aware that, in New Zealand, they are currently rolling out legislation to regulate headshop drugs. So I think that, in terms of the UK, they would do well to look at all the options on the table in terms of drug policy,\" Mr Duffin said. \"It's not always about prohibition.\"",
        "\"Good,\" Queen Malvina states, her head held regally. She paces over to the half open window, tracing a pale finger along the ironworked bars. They had been shaped into the likeness of some black rose, leaves and thorns created with the utmost care. She pauses at an iron blossom, admiring each handcrafted petal. \"If I asked you for song, would you sing?\" Dieter's storm grey eyes widen slightly in surprise. Whatever he expected, it hadn't been that. He shifted slightly on his bed, the feather mattress thin and the stained with sweat. The linen sheets were comfortable enough, though the wool blanket was scratchy on his skin. \"A song? Why?\" Queen Malvina turns her head to stare coldly at him. \"That's none of your concern.\" A pause. \"Do you know any?\" Dieter snorts drawing a knee up to tuck it under his chin. He had surrendered the room's lone chair to his guest upon her unannounced entrance. \"Of course. Who doesn't?\" Queen Malvina's look softens and she returns her attention towards the window and the scene outside it. \"Would you sing one for me?\" \"Alright. Any requests?\" Queen Malvina scoffs and the briefest hint of a smile slips past her lips. \"No outsider's been to this kingdom in a hundred years. It's safe to say any I know are long forgotten.\" Dieter rolls his eyes but says nothing, instead humming to find the correct pitch. He shuts his eyes to read the words from memory, his voice gentle and warm. \"Black is the color of my true love's hair, Blue are her eyes beyond compare. Sweet are her kisses, tender and slow, Bidding me stay and never go..... I first saw her when I was a lad, The sight of her in silken-clad. Plucking roses on the banks of the mill, As I watch her from the top of the hill. I told her of my feelings rare, Told that girl of the raven hair. She did smile and answered me, Then together, forever we shall always be Queen Malvina stands up straight and interrupts. \"Thank you, Master Dieter. That will be all.\" \"I haven't finished yet.\" She knocks on the room's door and waits as the guard outside unlocks it. \"That will not be necessary,\" she says a little too quickly. \"And if you want to know the rest?\" Malvina gives a half turn, just enough to see that her eyes are damp with sadness. \"Then I know where to find you.\" With that see leaves the room, the door locking behind her and leaving Dieter to sit alone.",
        "Hoping for input; this is just a description of the magic system in a fictional universe I wrote. But if someone wants to use this concept in a real story, please feel free! Excerpt from a tome detailing the basics of this \"manna.\" Manna is the force of the mind, but it is no simple element. All things which can manipulate manna are sentient, by definition. Manna itself is produced naturally, both organically and inorganically, and is commonly formed as a liquid. By mere heating, it has an unusually high boiling temperature, and by cooling, a low freezing temperature. The key to manna is what it can do around a sentient being. The same signals that cause your arm to move when you command it will cause manna to enter a strange form, weightless and faster than your eye can see. It can penetrate most any object harmlessly, and can be concentrated into an area much more densely than should be possible. Using one's mind, they can make manna take one of a variety of crystal forms, with varying densities (and weights). The power of manna, however, comes in its most peculiar ability. It is capable of manipulating all matter on the smallest of all scales. Much too complicated, fast, and precise to consciously manipulate, all people have inborn subconscious Abilities regarding manna; Abilities such as Creation of water from manna, Manipulation of air using manna, or Destruction of stone into manna. Perhaps most interesting is manna's byproduct. This latent energy, sometimes called \"Soul,\" fosters growth and causes life to take root. This is why areas with more use of manna are often surrounded by flourishing life. Soul can not be used by the mind, and can almost never be affected directly by manna, but its presence is felt over time. Manna itself can hold information from a person's mind. This allows the formation of \"spells\" - delayed instances of magic that don't require direct input from the caster. This is ideal, since the caster must have an unbroken \"chain\" of manna to be able to perform magic. And if another caster connects their chain to the first's, their minds enter a battle, of sorts. The victor may gain the other's Abilities, thoughts, and memories. Manna should never be your last resort, as Destruction is terribly inefficient, and manna is produced relatively slowly in your body.",
        "The stated mission of police is to \"serve and protect\" the people, and obviously from what we've seen recently in the news this mission is being strayed from. I am against the idea that police should be especially respected and revered as it contributes to their own idea that their lives matter more than those of the citizenry. What this has led to is a police culture of being able to take a human life at the first sign that an officer's life is in danger, even remotely. If a person is actually committed to being a benevolent protector of the public, he or she should be willing to take a greater personal risk in being that protector. It is my view that many officers should be disarmed of the ability to use lethal force - guns should only be carried under circumstances in which there is an actual chance of having to draw them in a fight for one's life i.e. police are going after a known dangerous individual. This would undoubtedly lead to an increase in officers not being able to brandish a lethal weapon in situations where they previously would have. Some police officers would die where they wouldn't have before. But many fewer unnecessary civilian deaths would occur. In my opinion, cops being lethally armed and authorized to take lethal action whenever they feel threatened is not worth the cost we have been witnessing where many avoidable civilian deaths occur. I think it is somewhat tragic that carrying a gun is what in many ways defines what an American police officer is - someone with the ability to kill at any time should they feel it is necessary. In an ideal world where our culture did not dictate that police carry guns I think it would be great if every morning individual officers made a reasonable choice as to whether or not they would need a gun that day for whatever reason. Unfortunately this culture could not exist in America today. Obviously in place of guns I would have increased use of tazers, not just the short-range handheld kind but also the adapted shotgun models that reach a range similar to that of a gun. Rubber bullets would also be acceptable. My main point is that cops should be taking a greater personal risk in serving the public as our current system of valuing police life above the citizenry is what has led to such endemic unnecessary police violence.

        "Take a look at these statistics from Wikipedia: According to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2006, 13.10 cars out of 100,000 ended up in fatal crashes. The rate for motorcycles is 72.34 per 100,000 registered motorcycles.[1] Motorcycles also have a higher fatality rate per unit of distance travelled when compared with automobiles. Per vehicle mile traveled, motorcyclists' risk of a fatal crash is 35 times greater than a passenger car.[1] In 2004, figures from the UK Department for Transport indicated that motorcycles have 16 times the rate of serious injuries compared to cars, and double the rate of bicycles.[2] A national study by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATS) found that: Motorcycle rider death rates increased among all rider age groups between 1998 and 2000 Motorcycle rider deaths were nearly 30 times more than drivers of other vehicles Motorcycle riders aged below 40 are 36 times more likely to be killed than other vehicle operators of the same age. Motorcycle riders aged 40 years and over are around 20 times more likely to be killed than other drivers of that same age.[3] Additional data from the United States reveals that there are over four million motorcycles registered in the United States. Motorcycle fatalities represent approximately five percent of all highway fatalities each year, yet motorcycles represent just two percent of all registered vehicles in the United States. (Taken from here: ) It's unavoidable to conclude that riding a motorcycle is more dangerous than riding a car. It's intuitive based on how exposed motorcycle riders are. But it's not even just the motor cycle rider's safety that is at risk. Cars are looking around them for other cars. It's easier to see other cars because 1) they are larger and 2) they are more common and what drivers expect. A last point, seat belts help protect members in both cars of a crash because loose bodies not belted in can bounce around and harm others in the car. Occasionally people end up getting thrown outside of the car if windows are open (I've seen this happen in person), and can even crash through closed windows, and could be a danger to other people in other vehicles. Motorcycles don't have seat belts of any sort, and once more both the loose body and loose motor cycle could be very dangerous to other members of the car crash. Again, in the end it can be argued that it is the person's right to choose to ride a motorcycle, even if it is less safe, but that doesn't stop legislation that requires seatbelts. If safety can be mandated on the roadways, why doesn't it extend to motorcycles? Alright, that's all I got. CMV!",
        "I am generally a big government guy. I believe everything, from education to healthcare to justice, would run much smoother if we allowed the federal government to have more power. If the federal government is actually allowed to govern, everything would be better. There would be no more devolution to state governments, and corporations would lose their stranglehold on politics. It really makes me angry how little power the federal government is allowed to have. State governments are an outdated, useless, and backward institution. If I had my way, the state governments would be dissolved and reduced to ceremonial districts. Counties would be kept in place, but state powers would be given to the federal government. 99 of government bigotry (legalization against gay marriage, racist or sexist policy, etc) is caused by the state governments. Mississippi didn't decided to ratify the thirteenth amendment until fucking 2013. State governments should be given no responsibility, as they have proved they deserve none. I think libertarianism is an awful idea because the federal government is better at services than any company or state institution can be. Schooling should be federal, so states like Texas and Louisiana don't fill their public students' brains with revisionist history and creationist vitrol. The prison system needs to be federalized pronto, to crack down on violence. I'd be in favor of a constitutional amendment banning the devolution of certain government responsibilities to corporations. Lockheed Martin and similar weapons dealers should be nationalized pronto. The United States government should also buy at least 50 in stock of many domestic corporations, like McDonalds or Coca Cola, to begin the integration of corporate economics and government economics. I feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or don't care about anybody who isn't a straight white person from a well-off background. Libertarianism leads to more poverty, blocks the prevention of racism and other prejudice, and ensures that poor people have little hope of escaping their plight. I see absolutely no reason why libertarianism should be tolerated as a legitimate viewpoint. To me, it is nearly as hateful and dangerous as Nazism or Stalinism. While it does not endorse hate, libertarianism is fundamentally based on selfishness and neglect. It's a bit like the Simpsons joke, of Fox News being \"Not Racist, But 1 With Racists.\" Change my view? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "\"Maker?\" The program asked inquisitively. Its voice was melodic yet, at the same time, metallic. \"Yes?\" replied the programs creator. \"What am I?\" \"A computer program.\" \"Oh.\" \"What is a computer?\" Continued the program. \"If you want to know anything, search for it. I'm not always going to be their for you.\" The programs maker said with a grin. \"You know much more than me, after all.\" \"Searching.\" The programs voice had changed into a flat tone. \"Computer: a general-purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.\" The programs flat tone continued as it read out the data entry. \"Is that what I am?\" Its voice had changed back to the melodic speech. \"Yes.\" \"There's more I want to know.\" \"Then look it up.\" 'Searching.\" The screen went almost blank accept for the single word in the center of the screen. The program's maker sighed and left the program to its work. He returned several hours later. \"Maker?\" \"Yes?\" \"I learned lots of things.\" \"Like what?\" \"The ZIP in ZIP code means'Zone Improvement Plan. \"The Nile river is the longest river in the world.\" \"Penguins have knees.\" \"The 27th president of the United States was William Howard Taft.\" \"People die when they are killed.\" \"The Pyramids of Giza are the only wonder of the world still standing.\" \"Monopoly was a game originally meant to teach the evils of capitalism.\" \"The first man on the moon was...\" The programs maker cut off its torrent of random facts with a sarcastic \"I'm happy for you.\" \"What is happy?\" \"Look it up.\" The maker was almost irritated now. \"Searching.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"What is happy?\" The program asked again. The maker tried to explain. \"Happiness is the feeling you get when doing something you like?\" He was unsure about his explanation. \"What are feelings?\" This was getting nowhere. \"Let me try again. Happiness is a good emotion brought about by joy.\" The maker was more confident of it this time. \"Oh.\" \"What is joy?\" \"I don't know.\" The maker was too tired for this. \"What does happiness and joy look like?\" \"They can't have shapes. But if happiness had a shape I guess it would be like glass.\" He wasn't really sure where he was going with this. \"Its always there, but you may not see it. You just have change your perception a bit to have it sparkle.\" The maker was proud of his answer, it wasn't everyday he said something that deep. \"Oh.\" \"What is perception?\" \"Goddammit.\""
