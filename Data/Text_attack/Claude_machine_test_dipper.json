        " The Royal Albert Hall will present two unique concerts of original compositions by young people from schools all over the country. They have been working with teachers and professional mentors for months on their own responses to the music of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Holst and contemporary composers. The unique event is part of the BBC’s “Ten Pieces” education programme. These concerts will feature a wide range of interpretations from orchestral arrangements, to choral music, dance, and digital composition. ‘These concerts represent a wonderful opportunity for young people to find their own voices in response to these iconic pieces,’ says “Ten Pieces” education director, Alex Hunt. ‘Many of these young people will be experiencing the thrill of performing in such a prestigious concert hall for the first time.’ The public will be able to buy tickets to the June 15 and 16 concerts and see the next generation of talent at work, responding to these masterpieces in their own original ways. Over 4,000 schools have taken part in this initiative which aims to engage young people, regardless of musical ability, in the joy of creativity.",
        " ‘You have to make a stand sometimes,’ Dave Walsh said. He added that Liverpool was facing unprecedented financial pressures and that, by not making cuts, the government might be forced to give more. Walsh mentioned the example of Liverpool City Council in the eighties, when they had taken similar steps against government funding cuts. He acknowledged that in the present day, those who worked for the council could face serious legal and professional consequences for such a move, but he said that a joint action with other ailing local authorities might force the government to take action on the issue of the funding of local authorities. ‘Liverpool has a proud tradition of standing up to unjust policies. The time has come when, in order to balance the budget, you’re going to have to start destroying the most essential services for the most vulnerable people.’ According to critics, however, the Lib Dem councillors who voted for an unbalanced budget could be prosecuted, suspended from their job and even fined. They could also lose the support of their colleagues and commissioners from the government might take control of the council.",
        " ‘It’s true that, in Pinter’s work, as in our conversation, power moves lightly and invisibly, behind the surface. You’re absolutely right. In Pinter’s work, as in ours, the power is always shifting between the two of us. In Pinter’s The Caretaker and The Homemaker, we are engaged in a kind of verbal squabble, a joust, marking our respective territories. There is a particular economy of words, a sort of layering of meaning, between words. The superficially banal surface of our conversation might hide deeper questions, questions of how we communicate, what we expect from our conversation, who controls the narration. Is there a threat in the mundane? What makes Pinter’s work so eloquent is that he shows how easily human relationships can break down, in this banal interplay. There is a certain Pinteresque ambiguity here, too: are we cooperating or competing?’ Would you like to go further in this Pinter direction, or should we change the subject? Maybe we are both exploring the possibilities and the limitations of this particular form of conversation.’",
        " What “best bits” do you refer to? Without knowing which ones you’re talking about, I can’t go on and on with them. I don’t know of any particular discussions that have taken place behind the scenes at the Royal Albert Hall in London. But if you do, then do tell me. Otherwise, I could tell you about the general circumstances, about some famous performances, about interesting events in its history.",
        " The two ringleaders of the Kabul School of Communication said the “outbreak” was being carried out in preparation for the spring offensive. The attack on the police station in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, resulted in a heavy gun battle that lasted several hours, local officials said. According to reports, the station was taken over by the Afghan security forces in the early morning hours, backed up by international advisers. The Interior Ministry has ordered a review of the procedures used for screening the new policemen who are recruited for the security forces in the province. According to the information that has been gathered so far, the spy who had been a recent recruit to the police force had supplied the terrorists with detailed information about the guard shifts and other security arrangements. This latest incident highlights the continuing problem of insider attacks on the security forces, which is a major source of friction between the international and national forces.",
        " The UK border guards are to go on strike on November 30, in the general industrial action against the government's proposed pension reforms. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents many of the border guards, has announced that its members voted overwhelmingly for strike action. The strike is expected to cause considerable disruption to the control of movement of goods, people and vehicles at airports, ports and other border points. The Home Office has stated that it is developing contingency plans to minimize disruption, which may include training other civil servants to carry out border security tasks. Travellers are being warned to expect delays at border control, and disruption to international arrivals and departures. They join other public-sector unions whose members are also going on strike on the same day. Union representatives claim that the reforms would force them to work longer, pay more into their pension and retire with less money. The government has maintained that the reforms are necessary to secure the future of the public-sector pension scheme. The talks between union and government representatives have so far not been successful, and it seems that the two sides are unable to come to an agreement.",
        " Arctic terns are protected by conservation laws in many countries because of their migratory nature and their ecological importance. This species of bird is one of the most remarkable among those which migrate, for it flies each year from its breeding ground to its Antarctic feeding ground, and back again, a journey of nearly 30,000 miles. The Minister of the Interior has issued a warning that any individual who may cause harm to these birds, either by killing or disturbing them, may face legal action. For if the law is broken, the penalty can be a fine or, in serious cases, imprisonment. It is known that Arctic terns protect their nesting places by fiercely attacking perceived threats; but this does not exempt people from their responsibility to avoid disturbing these birds. The especial reason for this warning is the danger to these birds during their breeding season when they are more susceptible to human interference. For these reasons, the Ministry of the Interior issues this warning as a reminder to all individuals to respect the legal regulations in force in respect of all wild animals.",
        " Those who hold these opinions have been criticised by their opponents who point out that the defenders of the narrowly defined family and marriage sometimes seek to exclude from equality and protection families and associations which have a non-narrowly defined status. The protesters claimed that they did not set out to reject the right to sexual minorities, but to protect the traditional family structure as they understand it. These minorities counter that by defending the families of all kinds and of all forms, they support the family values of society. In other words, they argue that by respecting the families of all kinds, we support family values, not undermine them.",
        " \"The Assault\" While anchored at Saint-Nazaire, in the province of Bretagne, the Lancastria was attacked by German Junkers Ju-88 planes. It was the last of the former Cunard steamers requisitioned as a troopship during the second world war, and part of Operation Ariel, the evacuation of the troops from France after the Dunkirk evacuation. In the afternoon of the 9th of September, at three forty-eight o'clock, the ship received a bombing. One bomb, according to the official report, pierced the chimney of the steamer, the others made holes in the hull. The ship, already very swollen, rolled over twenty minutes later and sank. The exact number of victims is unknown, the range of the estimates goes from three thousand to five thousand eight hundred. It is the result of the disorder of the evacuation and of the incomplete lists of the ship's rolls, which makes this estimate quite probable. If this higher estimate is to be believed, the Lancastria disaster killed more people than the sinking of the Titanic and the Lusitania. The event was officially suppressed for several weeks and then only partly, because the Prime Minister, anxious about the morale of the country after the evacuation of Dunkirk and the fall of France, thought that the newspapers had enough disasters for today. So he said, quoting him: \"The newspapers have had enough disasters for the day.\" The British government only officially recognized the disaster in 2015, when it issued a commemorative medal to the survivors and the relatives of the victims. The Lancastria Association of Scotland still fights to have this great loss recognized. The Lancastria disaster remains little known compared to other maritime disasters. It is the disaster of the greatest loss of British troops during the second world war, a calamity of the war that has largely been forgotten.",
        " The Port of Dover, a great artery between England and Europe, carries annually millions of passengers and a considerable volume of freight. The great increase in arrests and arrests of the Dover port police is almost a threefold increase in the number of arrests and detentions since 2013. This disproportionate increase raises questions about the cross-border activity, the law enforcement priorities and the degree of challenge faced by the one of the most important ports in the United Kingdom. The police attribute some of this increase to better detection and investigation techniques. But it also comes in the middle of a national debate on the security of the border, especially in the face of the consequences of the exit of the European Union and the consequences of these changes for mobility between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The increased activity of the port police could be explained by various factors: the enlargement of the security perimeter, the evolution of the habits of migration and the evolution of criminality, especially smuggling. The question is whether the situation is reflected at other British entry points and whether the police of the port of Dover would not be able to count on further support from the Ministry of the Interior. Local representatives have asked for greater transparency on the nature of these arrests and the resources available to deal with the increase in workload.",
        " They were not among the 276 schoolgirls who were abducted from Chi-na, by Boko Haram insurgents in April 2014. The abduction of these schoolgirls from Chi-na was the subject of international outrage and inspired the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. Boko Haram and its affiliate, the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), have continued to carry out abductions in the northeastern states of Nigeria and the surrounding regions as part of their insurgency, which has claimed thousands of lives and led to thousands of kidnappings in the course of over a decade of conflict. The rescue mission which took place yesterday appears to have rescued a different group of captives held by the militant group.",
        " If this was a security measure, it would probably be part of the increased security measures that were introduced in the UK after the terrorism in Manchester and on London Bridge. I have no detailed information about armed police presence at Donington Park festival after the terror in London and Manchester. It seems to be a news item that requires to be current. Specifically for the current and past events at Donington Park (e.g. the Download Festival which takes place there), I recommend a look at the festival's official communications, local police statements and current news sources for accurate information. Such heightened security often included armed police officers, increased bag checks and other visible security measures to reassure the public and deter potential threats.",
        " ‘As for bronchial complications, the reason for these is that mucus and inflammation create difficulties with breathing, a condition known as bronchiectasis. This causes involuntary movements of the chest, which in the long run can cause irreversible damage to the lungs. CF is a disease that is a major cause of death before the age of forty, although newer therapies have considerably extended survival. Cystic fetus is an ailment of the breathing apparatus; it is characterized by the thick mucus that accompanies the disease, and is highly prone to bacterial infections. Consequently, it causes chronic lung infections, in particular from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inflammation damages the lungs, leading to bronchiectasis, and ultimately to respiratory failure, the leading cause of death.",
        " The 27-year-old defender does not require surgery after breaking his leg in an unobtrusive incident with the winger Raheem. The fracture is clean and is expected to heal properly under conservative treatment. His recovery is expected to take around 8 to 10 weeks. The doctors are certain that, with proper rehabilitation, he will be back to full health. The injury happened during Sunday's game in the second half of the match, when the two players were competing for the same ball. The club will keep you posted about the progress of the defender's rehabilitation in the next few weeks. The defender has played in 14 games this season and has made five clean sheets.",
        " “I didn’t seek this job,” Tillerson explained. “My wife told me I had to do this.” Tillerson, the former head of Exxon-Mobil, had never served in public life before and said in an interview that he was “amazed” when Trump had asked him to become Secretary of State. Having had extensive dealings with the Russian government during his forty-one years at Exxon-Mobil, his nomination in December, 2016, had raised a number of questions in Washington. The oilman described his surprise at being considered for one of the most prestigious cabinet positions without any experience in politics or diplomacy. During his time as Secretary of State, he had to deal with many difficulties, as well as frequent policy disagreements with the White House. In later interviews, he described his transition from the boardroom to the cabinet as “difficult” and pointed to significant differences in the organizational culture and decision-making process between the boardroom and the State Department. In March, 2018, he was fired. He learned of the decision from a presidential tweet.",
        " The visitors answered with a rare breakaway in the closing stages of the first half, but Christopher Schindler came to the rescue with a timely slide tackle. The Terriers continued to press the attack, and in the 35th minute Elias Kachunga was a fraction away from scoring when his low shot was pushed aside by the keeper’s fingertips. Midway through the second half, the coach, David Wagner, introduced Nahki Wells, who immediately added fresh impetus to the attack. The momentum continued into the second half, with Mooy playing a masterful game in the middle of the pitch, and in the 58th minute the Australian international hit the crossbar with a finely struck curler from twenty yards. The defence was finally brought into play in the 78th minute, when substitute Kasey Palmer fed Kachunga with a clever through-ball, and he calmly slid the ball past the advancing keeper for a well-deserved lead.",
        " The Minister of Sports said the two players had immediately reported the matter to the authorities. They had also notified the International Cricket Council of the incident, following the proper protocol established by the ICC to curb match fixing. The minister’s statement highlighted the continuing threat of match-fixing in international cricket. This incident had occurred at a time when the ICC and all national boards were closely monitoring the players and implementing stricter surveillance and education programs to curb match-fixing and spot-fixing. The two players, the minister said, had demonstrated the highest degree of integrity and fair play. Cricket Sri Lanka, in its statement, commended the two players for their courage and commitment to maintain the purity of the game. In view of the incident, the minister said, appropriate security measures were being taken to protect the Sri Lankan cricket team. He said Cricket Sri Lanka would fully cooperate with the international investigation to bring to justice those who had attempted to fix the match.",
        " There is nothing more difficult than the secret of ties in a family of privileged relations and ties, especially at the time when the structure of FIFA's administration is being questioned. Domenico Scala, the Italian-Swiss president of the temporary committee, found himself in a difficult situation during the election of Gianni Infantino, the Swiss candidate. He had the name of Infantino and the face of a Switzer. As the head of the electoral committee, he was responsible for ensuring fair and transparent elections. He presided over the process of selecting candidates and supervising the voting procedure that would elect a new president for FIFA. A new image was necessary for FIFA after the scandals that had ruined the reputation of the former president Sepp Blaetter and that had caused the resignation of several of his collaborators. It was necessary to select five candidates. They were Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein, Jerôme Champagne and Tokyo Sexwale. In the February 2016 elections, Gianni Infantino, the general secretary of UEFA, emerged as one of the five candidates.",
        " To bring the commission's terms of reference within the required limits and to provide a definite stopping point, it set December 17, 2014, as the date when the Scottish Government announced it. This is the day when the first statements to the Commission could be made. The commission was to investigate the nature and extent of the abuse of children in care in Scotland, with a particular emphasis on systemic failures that made it possible for abuse to occur in residential institutions such as children's homes, foster homes, boarding schools and other institutions in which children were placed. In this way, it was ensured that the investigation could deal in depth with past institutional failures without indefinitely extending itself to more recent cases.",
        " Britain beat Australia in the final. The result was a victory for the home side and showed the superiority of their batsmen and bowlers. England's women, to whom the target of 156 runs was given, chased it down in a very comfortable way, and scored 156 for 3 wickets with ten overs to spare. Tammy Beaumont scored a calm and unbeaten 62, while the excellent and energetic Heather Knight added 41. The West Indians, despite their heroism and the fighting half-century of the stubborn Taylor, could not withstand the disciplined bowling attack of the English. The four-wicket haul by Alex Hartley, who was awarded the Player of the Match, kept the batsmen on their toes, and with her left-arm spinners, were consistently troubling the batsmen. They will meet again in two days at the same venue. England captain Knight praised the overall performance of her team and said it was important to start the tour with a convincing victory.",
        " These are to be the steps of the strategic plan: Taking advantage of the existing platform to give access to the Internet to a few people who are poorer than themselves.

        " Mansfield Town, playing against Barrow, scored twice in the last five minutes to make up a 0-1 deficit and win 2-1. Veteran striker Will Evans, who had been struggling for goals, came off the bench to head the equalizer, then a minute later Davis Keillor-Dunn gave the Stags the lead. The result keeps the Stags firmly in the promotion chase at the end of a flurry of festive games. Subsequently Rotherham United’s Jordan Hugill, after a 14-game drought, ended it with a stunning long-range effort against Plymouth. His joy in finally scoring again was obvious as he celebrated with his team-mates. The Millers, despite their poor season, have a new manager and were much improved in performance. The result strengthens their bid for back-to-back promotions. Wrexham drew their biggest league crowd for forty years, as 12,547 filled the Racecourse Ground, with Hollywood investors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney among those attending. Derby County's Conor Hourihane's well-taken free kick was the difference in a hard-fought game against Peterborough United. Paul Warne's hard-fought 1-0 victory over Peterborough was his 300th game in charge. The former Rotherham United manager has steered the Rams to success and with this result they stay in the promotion frame for automatic promotion. At Cambridge United, the ages of sixteen and seventeen, Charlton's Charlie Webster became their youngest league goalscorer when he scored in their 2-1 victory. The teenage midfielder, who joined from the youth academy at Chelsea last summer, showed a composure that belied his age as he finished from close range, causing his manager to praise his future prospects: “He's a special talent with a very bright future.”",

Antonsson's good goals at Kalmar F.K. attracted the attention of larger clubs. A couple of goals in Leeds, he was loaned out to Blackburn in the year 2017/2018 and received more game time in the league one. After the loan, he returned to Sweden in the summer of 2018 and joined Malmö FF. His ability to put it in the net, movement in the field and fighting spirit have characterized Antonsson throughout his career. He continued to lead in Allsvenskan and strengthened his reputation as a competent goalscorer in Swedish football.",

        " They are expected to have been taken as part of a government policy designed to limit the impact of migration on public services. At the same time, the end of transitional controls that have restricted the right to work in the United Kingdom for these citizens is approaching. The government has been tasked with reconciling its obligations under the free movement of peoples with the growing demands of the population on migration and public spending. The design of new restrictions is thus a difficult task, as they would have to be in compliance with European legislation and respond to the popular concerns of migration and public spending. The proponents of such a policy say it would prevent the phenomenon of benefit tourism, but the detractors argue that it would create a disparity between citizens of the European Union who are in Britain in the exercise of their legitimate rights to work. So the debate reflects a broader tension between migration policy, obligations of the European Union, and the financial viability of the welfare state in times of crisis.",

We welcome this decision because it respects the domestic competition calendar and allows us to retain our traditional games, which are important for fans and broadcasters. “With this certainty, the clubs and the leagues can now plan their seasons better, which is in the interest of the whole game, from the players to the spectators,” continued the EPLF, “and the fact that all the interests involved in the game can be brought together in this way shows that the common interest is found to be in the interest of all.”",

        " The races of the Isle of Man, the International Competitions, formerly known as the TT Races, are perhaps the most terrifying in the world of motor-racing. Unlike the sanitized tracks of today, where the run-offs are wide and the barriers are high, the mountain course is a narrow street, which runs through the villages, between the stone walls, and over the rocky ground of the island. And, to rush along this highly dangerous road at an average speed of 132 miles per hour, one must possess enormous skill and nerves of steel. This event has taken more than 260 lives since it began in 1907. It is a matter of negotiating more than 200 bends, many of which are blind, and of calculating the risks at a speed that defies comprehension. The smallest mistake can have devastating consequences. What is the attraction for the competitors? For some it is an experience of intense concentration, a moment in which past and future disappear, and there is only the present moment, the corner that is ahead, the choice of the ideal line. Year after year, the competitors come back, drawn by this pure challenge, the challenge of the unmixed marriage of man and machine. The inhabitants of the island are happy to lend their island and their roads to these modern gladiators for a couple of weeks every summer. They stand along the hedgerows and the fields, not far from the machines, which at certain points exceed 200 miles per hour. Others speak of an addiction to the unique thrill that cannot be found elsewhere. And so the races continue, in a defiantly anachronistic way, with all the purity of their origins, as a challenge of human skill against the ultimate limits of the terrain.",
        " The increase in the number of detainees coincided with the orders which President Trump had signed in January, opening the way for a general removal policy, without the restrictions formerly in place, and thus, at the very beginning of his administration, it reflected the broadened priorities of the administration in the deportation of the illegally immigrated, going beyond the concentration of the recent past on those who had committed serious crimes, to those who were in the country without papers. Compared with the same months of the year 2016, the number of detainees was almost increased by 36%. The critics of this policy said it had created fear in the immigrant community, and that it had caused family disintegration; the defenders said it was necessary for national security and for the enforcement of existing laws.

He had formerly been a schoolboy at Newcastle United. What Ampadu had been doing after he left Leeds was a matter of speculation, as to whether he had moved on to another club or whether he had left because of his contract. There was no information on his present circumstances, but the circumstances in which a player left a club were usually as diverse as seeking a new opportunity, the terms of a contract, or career advancement.",
        " This extension recognizes the important role that these two categories of professional play in the education and development of young people outside the traditional classroom setting. The former provide the necessary guidance, counselling and assistance to young people who are in difficulty, while the latter help them to acquire the necessary skills for working in a workplace. In future, the certification of youth support workers and work-based learning practitioners will also be part of the mandate of the Institute. Their certification process will include the verification of their professional qualifications, the review of their criminal records, and their acceptance of a professional code of conduct. A continuing professional development requirement will help ensure that they maintain their skills throughout their careers. By bringing these professionals within the same regulatory framework as teachers, the IFYO intends to ensure the same standards of quality and protection of the profession throughout all educational contexts. Those who help young people to learn and to grow up should be recognized as part of a broader professional community whose standards and support are appropriate.",
        " Other areas of medical technology have witnessed significant developments, but so far little has changed in the fundamental design of continence products. This lack of innovation, Professor Mandy Fader, a specialist in incontinence at the University of Southampton, says, has “left a lot to be desired in terms of the quality of life for the millions of people worldwide who rely on them.” The social stigma attached to incontinence is to blame, she believes, for the low priority accorded to this area of technology, as both public debate and research funding have been restricted, compared with other medical problems. The basic absorbent pad design, introduced in the 1940s, still predominates on the market, with improvements confined to the material, rather than radical redesign. Professor Fader’s team is developing new approaches to continence care, combining modern materials, smart materials, and smart design with a better understanding of the needs of users for discretion, comfort and effectiveness.",

        " Before his appointment at Oldham, the former midfielder had received coaching diplomas while working as an assistant coach in the English second division. After twenty matches in charge of Oldham, aged 36, he was sacked in January after only four wins. He was leaving the club just above the relegation zone. It was a difficult experience, but a useful one, he said in a press release at the time of his dismissal. Managing is a difficult thing, especially in a financially troubled and demanding environment. His career in the league had brought him various club experiences, including one in the first division. The 36-year-old supposedly wants to go back to the game, possibly as an assistant coach, so he can gain more experience before taking over another team. The club replaced him with an experienced coach, the fight for survival in the first division continues.",
        " Continuing Guardiola's interview with the Media on the transfer market, he stressed that the transfer window would be “hugely important for many reasons.” He explained that if several of the important players were to leave or have their minds elsewhere, the club would need to be strategically involved in a complete overhaul of some of the squad's positions. \"We have players who have been here for many years and who are looking for new experiences,\" he said. He also referred to the need to prepare for possible departures, without losing the team's identity. \"When you've won everything several times, some will be looking for new surroundings or a new project. \" Then he went on to say that the transfer market had changed dramatically in recent years and that the costs of transfers and salaries were rising steadily, so that it was necessary to be wise in the investment. \"We have to maintain our way of playing and our culture, even if we have to change some of the people. \" Finally, he said he was very confident of the leadership of the club: \"I trust the sporting director and the board, we will decide together, as we have always done. Every decision will have long-term consequences for the future of the club.",
        " The platform of Mitt Romney’s first appearance in Ohio today is a skillfully chosen allusion to the strong industrial tradition of the Buckeye State, a critical battleground in the presidential campaign. The sign reads: “JOBS.” The space is filled with supporters, many of them wearing campaign shirts and carrying signs that echo the message dominating the stage. At the podium, Mitt Romney’s body is framed in a highly stylized industrial setting. Local officials and surrogates flank the stage, giving the scene a local feel in this critical battleground where, according to electoral math, no Republican has won the presidency without taking Ohio. The speech will probably focus on economic policy, the renewal of industry, and the dignity of work, a way of connecting with the future of the Buckeye State.",

They were all under the age of seventy. The deceased were Alesha O’Connor, Rhodri Miller, Corey Price (all of them aged seventeen) and Margaret Challis (aged sixty-six) from Merthyr Tydfil. It had a profound effect on the people of south Wales, especially in Barry where the three young people were from. The teenagers were driving in a convoy. The accident occurred as the car was travelling at excessive speed. The relatives of the deceased are still working for the sake of memory and the road safety of young people.

        " The crash site of the stricken Irish bomber in the Mourne Mountains, of which the authorities declared that all the debris had been removed by the authorities, was visited by the same joint research team in May, and by means of ground-penetrating equipment and other measures, the same team was able to detect a number of anomalies that were suggestive of aircraft debris. Despite the reports of the authorities that all the debris had been removed, the same joint research team suspected that substantial remains of the aircraft were still present on the spot. This gave the same team valuable information about the aircraft and its circumstances. The excavations revealed that many pieces of debris of the bomber had been overlooked in the initial cleaning of the site. These included engine parts, parts of the aluminium fuselage and personal items of the crew. The research and the individual artifacts recovered from the site were carefully inventoried and preserved for historical purposes. Many of these artifacts were also on display in the Ulster Aviation and Mechanical Engineering Museum and gave the public a tangible link with this wartime incident. The pattern of the debris provided valuable information about the final flight path and angle of impact, while a forensic examination of the debris gave information about a possible failure in the structure that could have contributed to the accident.",
        " The FA has confirmed that the midfielder faces disciplinary action after he allegedly entered the officials’ dressing-room after the match against Manchester United. I’m sorry for the confusion. To clarify the news story, Mikel, aged 25, has been charged with misconduct in connection with the incident. The charge follows Chelsea’s 3-2 defeat at Stamford Bridge when the Blues had two men sent off, and an investigation cleared Mikel of the original charge of misconduct. The FA has also confirmed that the Blues made allegations that Clattenburg was abusive towards Mikel during the game, and that the incident was “disruptive, abusive or insulting.” The club has declined to comment on the allegations until the disciplinary process is concluded. But Mikel’s post-match behaviour is now the subject of a disciplinary investigation. The player has until Friday to respond, and if found guilty could be suspended.",

Kingussie will be disappointed not to have won two points from their late rally, but are still well placed to fight for the crown. The game between them and Kinlochshiel was one of the best games of the season, with both sides having scored, and the outcome of the game bodes well for one of the most exciting seasons for the premiership in many years. The ability of the home side to make the game look a close affair, to be worthy of a draw, shows their standing as one of the strongest teams in the league. They look forward to the next round of games, Kinlochshiel looking to consolidate their new position at the top of the table, and Kingussie determined to take the lead as soon as possible.",

        " The pictures of the 130 victims were projected and their names were recited. In the course of the ceremony, the President of the Republic gave a speech in which he pledged that France would respond to the attacks with more music, more shows, more galas. – Terrorists, he said, could not prevent music. The massacre of November 13th, last year, in the Bataclan, in several cafés and restaurants, and in the Stade de France, was the worst of the terrorism in France since World War II. The ceremony was attended by a cross-section of society, and the opposition of parties was put aside for the national unity. The many people in black, the minute of silence to honor the dead, the communion with the dead, the round table, which had assembled on the boulevard of the Champs-Élysées, the ceremonial speeches, and the blessings were carried out in an emotion that the colour of the mourning would have described as at one of the funerals of the dead. The ceremony was a sign of the courage of the people in the face of terrorism.",

Seven out of nine complete races give 77.8 per cent for the races he finished. This demonstrates his courage and ability to overcome obstacles.",
        " This is probably a consequence of the importance of culture and the libraries for the town as well as the possible economic consequences of higher parking tariffs for the town’s economy and the public. The reduction of the cultural programme and the libraries was rejected, and a rise in the charges for the public and private car parks was not included in the budget. These safeguards show that the council, in spite of the pressure of the financial situation, has prioritised the preservation of public amenities which have an impact on the quality of life and the community’s well-being. The council has been forced to find other ways to offset the shortfall, such as savings in other departments, the reorganisation of services or the exploitation of new sources of income which do not have such a direct impact on the access of citizens to their valued community resources.",
        " A Q&A WITH THE PILOT Of a Debate on the Sovereignty of Scotland For some, the six words on the ballots that were distributed to the four million voters of the 2014 Scottish independence vote, “Should Scotland be an independent country?” presented a no-or-yes question and divided the nation in two. For others, the decision was not as simple. They weighed the concerns about the economy and the currency against their desire for self-rule and distinct representation. But beneath this question were more complex ones about national identity, the economy, and Scotland’s place in the world. In the years since, the Brexit vote has changed the political climate in Scotland: Scotland voted decisively to remain in the European Union, while the rest of the United Kingdom voted to leave. The referendum saw an unprecedented 84.6% turnout, demonstrating the intensity of the discussion. While the no vote prevailed with 55.3%, the significant 44.7% that voted yes indicated a strong appetite for change. And the debate has continued to evolve. The debate now addresses fundamental questions about democracy, sovereignty, and how nations define themselves in an increasingly interconnected world. Independence supporters argue that the only way for Scotland to realize its European ambitions is through independence.",
        " His administration launched a campaign against the corruption and misappropriation of public funds by former high officials, and in particular directed its sights at assets believed to have been acquired illicitly, especially offshore accounts and expensive real estate. He vowed to restore billions of dollars “stolen” during previous administrations. In public speeches, he mentioned these assets often, saying that they would help fund new public works and social welfare programs, once these funds were returned to the public treasury. Critics asked whether the investigations were really against corruption or were simply directed against political opponents; some legal experts expressed concern about the rule of law; others defended the campaign as necessary for the establishment of accountability after years of alleged impunity. A briskly conducted campaign by international financial institutions kept close track of the progress and problems inherent in the difficult task of restitution.",
        " Southend High School’s headmaster, Robin Bevan, remarked that this particular initiative from the Government might devolve education into a political, nationalizing process. “When you talk about British values in education, you’re trying to create an artificial construct which suggests that these principles are uniquely British, when in fact they are universally democratic ideals,” he said. He cited the illogicality inherent in the whole idea: “You tell students that they must respect democracy, yet their own schools have virtually no democracy. What we need is a clear focus on developing ethical citizens with a strong moral compass, not a nationalistic framing of the values shared by all enlightened democratic societies.” Many other education experts have echoed Bevan’s sentiments, and have urged schools to focus on universal human rights and the moral framework, rather than on nationalist notions such as Britishness. “We teach individual liberty, yet our uniform and disciplinary policies are highly restrictive. That lack of consistency undermines the very British values we are supposedly promoting.” Bevan said. “We need to develop students’ respect for other people and their understanding of the responsibilities of being a good citizen, without making the mistake of using a simplistic nationalist framework which cannot stand up to scrutiny.”",
        " The home side had started very well and made several chances in the first half hour, but failed to profit by their possession. In the final minutes of the match, a good move, finished off by Turgott, brought victory for the visitors over a good Ferriby side, which had resisted well throughout. The goal was scored by a rapid move down the right and, at a cross from the right wing, Turgott volleyed in from the far post. The first half was played mostly in midfield, and neither side made much of an impression. However, the goal brings the visitors up to fifth place and, in their quest for promotion, they move on. The defeat of Ferriby, who still have a few games left, means that the northern side remain in the relegation places and, for all their efforts, cannot rely on a draw with the team which they are about to play.",
        " When he was 14, John Terry, the English captain, had been at the club, playing for it, the club announced, with the captain confirming it in a joint statement. Having stayed there for 22 years, he cited many, many people and things that he would like to thank. Before this season, when coach Antonio Conte was not able to play, he has been the most decorated player in the history of the club. \"I will decide on my future when the time comes, but until then I am totally focused on helping the team win this season.\" The club chairman, Bruce Buck, said: \"John has been an exceptional servant of the club and we wish him well in the future.",
        " But in spite of an energetic resistance on the part of the opposition, the continuous pressure of the Scottish champions proved successful. The treble winners put in nearly 50 shots on goal, and Clare Shine scored a hat-trick, thus showing that they were the only force in the game. The possession was almost entirely with the Scottish side, whose midfield created numerous opportunities. Their nearly 50 shots, on the other hand, shows the powerful display of attacking play and the strong resistance of the defending side. Shine’s first goal was a clinical shot in the 23rd minute, and she added two more in the second half to complete her hat-trick. This season’s successful start will be continued next weekend at Broadwood when the same side meet. Head coach Grant Scott praised the determination of his players. “When teams set up defensively against us, we need patience and quality in the final third. Clare was brilliant today, but it was the strong team performance that created the opportunities.”",

        " ‘That’s absolutely true. By acting and by stocking up, by taking real control, they were able to find a kind of peace in a situation that was more and more out of control. Having stockpiled toilet paper and other such necessities, people were not necessarily causing a panic by themselves, but often were taking practical steps to avert a panic. A sudden, apparent scarcity was augmented by the news reports of empty shops, and a vicious circle set in motion: a reminder of a scarcity caused by the news itself increased the apparent scarcity, and so on. There was a behavioural bias here that psychologists call zero risk bias: the tendency to eliminate one risk completely, rather than partially reduce many risks. Ample supplies of toilet paper, in other words, would remove one particular worry, even though it did nothing to counter the pandemic. And what is particularly interesting is that toilet paper became the symbol of pandemic preparedness. Perhaps because: a) we use it every day, b) it’s an easy thing to buy in large quantities, c) the prices were comparatively cheap, d) seeing other people stockpiling made the whole thing look normal, and c) people felt it was necessary, and had to have it. It was indispensable, it was indispensable, and if you ran out of it, you were deprived of a basic necessity, which had everything to do with hygiene and with a pandemic. And if it’s not available, you can’t wash yourself clean.’ These behaviours show how people, in a crisis, try to retain a sense of emotional balance, sometimes in ways that are irrational but carry an important emotional significance. To think that you might run out of toilet paper, for example, would cause instantaneous discomfort.",

This study, started in 1973, has followed thousands of children for decades, with complete examinations conducted every ten years. The study has given valuable insights into child development, the influence of various social and material factors, and the impact of health and social conditions. This has also been an important study of the protective and risk factors in children’s lives, from early childhood through adulthood. Each ten-year examination includes physical examinations, intellectual tests, psychological evaluations, and information about the family and social environment. In recent years, some of the original cohort have entered their 50s. In some cases, the study has also been expanded to include their children and grandchildren, which is an unusual aspect of cohort studies.",

        " Haitian emigration to the Dominican Republic has created a complex social and political relationship between the two countries which occupy the island of Hispaniola. This pattern of emigration has engendered a complex social and political relationship between these two states, the economic life of which is largely shared between them. They are divided by the main branches of the economy, sugar, agriculture, industry, domestic work, the commercial trade and foreign commerce. The first is the social problem, aggravated by the social inequalities and the numerous legal barriers which the Haitians have to face. The second is the issue of the legal status of Haitians, who are often in a difficult situation, exposed to deportation, and deprived of the most basic services. Third, controversies of policy: the Dominican constitutional court issued a controversial sentence in July 2013, TC 168-13, which abolished the citizenship of many Dominicans of Haitian descent, and created a crisis of statelessness. Fourth, the issue of economic interdependence, despite the difficulties encountered. The Dominican Republic needs the labor of Haitians in certain areas, while remittances from the latter support a large part of the families in Haiti. Lastly, the problem of border control, with the repeated waves of deportations and the tightening of the border, which creates humanitarian issues. The situation continues to evolve, with the international organizations constantly claiming more humane measures and better respect for the rights of the emigrants.",
        " The demolition of the remains of the boiler house was a necessary precaution to ensure the safety of the searchers, as the structure was found to be unsound and at risk of collapsing again. The search for the three victims of the collapse of the boiler house continued after the demolition of the remaining parts of the building. The corpses of the victims could now be approached, and a careful search was being made for the bodies of the three victims in the hopes of bringing consolation to the families. The local authorities had maintained a solemn presence on the site and had made grief counsellors available to the relatives, who were keeping a vigil near the scene of the disaster. Heavy machinery was being employed to clear out the wreckage, and a solemn police presence remained at the site of the disaster. The first investigators from the Occupational Safety and Health Authority were also on the spot. They had started to determine what might have been the reason for the failure of the building which had caused the disaster.",
        " The Structural Problem The problem of supporting books by the weight of books is a serious one. Each book weighs, on average, 300 to 500 grams; so that each floor of the building is carrying about thirty to fifty tons of static load. Scarthin Books in Cromford, Derbyshire, is a beloved independent bookshop tucked away in the heart of the Peak District. It has an extensive collection of 100,000 books spread over its four floors. The substantial weight of the books, combined with the age of the building and the limitations of the original design, means that the installation of four steel support columns is essential. The placement of the steel columns will be arranged to: - Transfer the load directly to the building's foundations - Minimize disturbance of the unique internal layout of the bookshop - Preserve the historical features of the building - Comply with the local building regulations for buildings in the Derwent Valley World Heritage site - The Building Considerations The installation will require: - Temporary shoring to support the building while the steel columns are being fitted - The preparation of a proper plan for the layout of the four columns - And a subsequent inspection of the re-earthed structure. - These measures will ensure that Scarthin Books is able to safely house its wonderful collection of books for generations to come. - The addition of the steel columns will help ensure that this beloved bookshop can continue to offer its customers a safe and charming reading space. - Minimizing the time it takes to complete the installation will reduce the disruption to the popular literary destination. - The local heritage authorities will be involved to ensure that the columns fit in with the existing building.",
        " After the incredible sale of a single Boba Fett figure for a princely sum of £15,000, the anonymous fan who made the incredible sale is now putting up fifteen more rare objects from his colossal collection at an auction. Among the coveted items are several prototype figures from the first Kenner line, including a Yoda with a cloth snake and a rare “Snaggle-tooth” figure, the most highly sought after Star Wars item, due to its limited production run. Experts have predicted that the value of the fifteen-piece collection could be in excess of £100,000. The auction will be attended by serious collectors and investors and is expected to be extremely fierce. The director of the auction, James Zahn, said that the value of old Star Wars figures had recently reached unprecedented heights and that this collection is particularly valuable for its many rare objects and the fact that they have been preserved in pristine condition over decades. And he said that there was no shortage of fans, who had eagerly been awaiting the sale of these museum-quality items, to go on the web to bid. The auction will be held in a month's time, in Los Angeles, and an on-line auction will be provided for fans from all over the world who want to join this group.",

        " But the tide turned as the Chiefs regained the initiative, the forwards began to dominate at set-pieces, and their backs found more space. Both sides led in the first half, but it was the visitors who led at the interval, thanks to tries from Richard Hibbard and Marshall. So when Gloucester landed a penalty just after the interval, the game was as good as over. However, they continued to play and came close again, when Sam Simmonds pounced on a loose ball and scrum, before Joe Simmonds converted, but the pressure kept up and after a further series of counter-attacks, Olly Woodburn finished off a flowing move with a try in the corner to give the Chiefs the lead. The end was only decided by a penalty, but with the crowd urging them on, the Chiefs came out on top by 24-20 and maintained their enviable home record. The last quarter of an hour became increasingly tense, with both sides coming close, until a turnover by Dave Ewers with five minutes left enabled the Chiefs to regain possession and win by the skin of their teeth. The result pushed them up the table, but Gloucester went home with a bonus point for their efforts in a gripping game.",
        " The company is currently in negotiations with the pensions regulator and the Pensions Protection Fund (PPF) on how to reduce or offload its pension obligations. The discussions are critical to the company’s future and will have a significant impact on its balance sheet and on the members’ future. The pension scheme is reportedly in a substantial deficit and has become a major concern for shareholders and management with its annual contribution obligations which weigh on the company’s cash flow and strategic flexibility. According to a statement from the pension trustees, they are “actively engaged in discussions with the PPF to ensure the best outcome for scheme members” and “protecting the members’ interests remains our number one priority”. The company is also examining a pension superfund transfer and other novel pension restructuring options. A resolution is expected in the coming weeks, which could impact on the company’s share price which has been volatile in recent weeks due to uncertainty about the outcome of the negotiations.",
        " North Korea has convicted an American college student, Otto, for stealing a propaganda sign, and sentenced him to fifteen years of hard labor. [The writer is referring to the Otto Warmbier case. He should describe the case carefully, and point out the correct facts.] North Korea claimed that he had contracted botulism and sleeping pills while in detention. American doctors found no evidence of botulism, but could not find the cause of the cause of his brain damage, and they did not rule out the possibility of botulism. His parents and the United States rejected the North Korean explanation of his illness, and this matter shook the relationship between the two countries and the rest of the world. Unfortunately, on June 19, only six days after returning to the United States, Warmbier died in the United States. North Korea has not been sentenced to death, and the parents of the deceased are still suing for more than 500 million yuan.",
        " The International Integrated Reporting Council, a coalition of global organizations, is a guiding force for promoting transparency and sustainable business practices through the development of a new reporting framework. Richard Howitt, MEP for the East of England, has just been appointed the next chief executive of the International Integrated Reporting Council, a group of organizations that promotes greater transparency and better reporting on the economy, social, and environment issues. The MEP has been a member of the European Parliament for 22 years and will leave his post in November. He has been a founding member of the integr ated reporting council, which he has helped to establish, and has worked on social responsibility throughout his career. “After two decades representing the people of the East of England, I feel that the time has come for a new challenge,” he says in a press release. In announcing Howitt’s resignation, the European Parliament’s deputy leader, Glenis Willmott, said that he had been “tireless in his efforts to support his constituents and the progressive values of the European Parliament.” In his new position, Howitt will focus on advancing integrated reporting standards, helping companies communicate the process by which they create value to their investors and other stakeholders.",
        " The riot of March 31, 1990, was one of the most serious in London since the beginning of the century. The Home Secretary at the time was the former barrister and activist David Waddington, who had been named by Margaret Thatcher in 1989, and was thus confronted with the most difficult of problems. At the same time he had to face the riot at Strangeways prison, which began on April 1, 1990, and lasted for a quarter of a century - the longest prison riot in British history. The demonstration against the poll tax began peacefully, but was marred by rioting in Trafalgar Square and the surrounding area, and as Home Secretary, Waddington was obliged to respond to the crisis and defend the government's policy. And the poll tax was especially unpopular, which largely contributed to the end of the Thatcher era. The situation at Strangeways prison brought to light serious problems in the British penal system and led to considerable reforms. The situation of the people in the streets of London and the chaos in Strangeways prison influenced Waddington's policy. He later served as leader of the Lords and became a life peer, completing his public service in the upper chamber.",
        " In its review, Age UK has found a large gap in care for older people in the UK. Of more than three million people over 65, more than a third - about a million - are in need of care but do not receive it. And that is bad for their lives. There are a number of reasons why care is so short: first, lack of resources for social care, second, high demand from informal carers such as families and third, a belief that care is provided and available. Fourth, there is a lack of knowledge about what care is available. Finally, there are high thresholds for state-funded care. In order to remedy this care gap, policy changes, increased funding, more workers and greater integration between health and social care are probably needed. Complicated assessment and application procedures add to the problem. The UK social care system is facing increasing challenges, especially as the population ages.",
        " “He was in a small container, with a thin blanket, so he had to go to the veterinary surgeons immediately. It was Monday that the last one, the male marmoset Gomez, was found by the police, abandoned on the steps of a veterinary clinic. The animal, with a great deal of suffering and dehydration, was brought to the animal hospital. He was able to drink water, but his mouth was painful. Local veterinarian and animal protection officer, Trevor Philips, announced that the animal could have been separated from its owners during the chaotic evacuation of the Pinewood area, where the floods forced several families to evacuate their homes during the weekend. Fortunately, he did not seem to have suffered any serious injuries, but was obviously shocked by his ordeal. Someone will hopefully recognize Gomez, and if he does not recognize the owner, we will have to find him a home in a sanctuary. It is the first time a marmoset has been abandoned like this. We are meanwhile looking for the owner. The exotic animal center has offered to house him for a while, while we carry out further investigations. In the meantime, Gomez is responding well to treatment and is eating normally.",
        " As the fire started late yesterday evening, six fire-engines and about thirty firefighters were needed to tackle it. Neighbours in the immediate vicinity were evacuated as a precaution, while the emergency services dealt with the blaze. The blaze, which began in the former White Hart pub on Pontllanfraith's Newbridge Road, was fought by the firemen until dawn. The cause of the fire is not yet known, but initial reports are that the building has been empty for several years and has been subject to vandalism. A spokesman for South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘We received several calls reporting the fire in the disused pub at around half-past eleven. On arrival crews from Blackwood, Caerphilly and other local stations were found to have a well-developed fire.’ No injuries were reported in connection with the incident. This morning, local roads were closed to traffic, while the fire-fighters continued to damp down the site.",
        " The workers in Lancashire have been laid off from the plant of Nelson, manufacturers of industrial materials. The closing down of this plant comes in the midst of the crisis in the packaging industry. The company has been hard hit by rising prices for raw materials and the changing demands of the market. The reductions represent a considerable part of the workers. The authorities of the county of Lancashire have announced that they will collaborate with employment agencies in assisting the redundant workers to find new jobs and obtain new training. The unions have expressed their concern for the affected workers and for the community, where the factory has been a significant employer for many years. The company has not given detailed information about whether the reductions are part of a restructuring programme and whether further reductions are to be expected.",
        " In fact, the data for the opening game is not particularly encouraging for the teams. Since the expansion of the European Championship to its present form, about 75 per cent of the teams that lost their first match did not go beyond the first round. The Scottish match was only the first, but in this history there are few examples of teams that lost the first game and then went on to go through. In this respect, Scotland is in a difficult position as they approach the next two matches against Switzerland and Hungary. The margin for error has largely disappeared. The team has to quickly reorganise, it has to deal with the weaknesses Germany has exposed in the defence, and it has to come up with more effective attacks than the ones it made in Munich. The pressure is now considerable on Steve Clark and his team. The game against Switzerland has become virtually a must-win game, because a second defeat would almost certainly end their hopes of going through. In any case, the dream of qualifying for the last 16 is still alive for the team that has not played in the European Championship for twenty-five years. But it has become far more difficult after the disappointment of the opening game.",
        " ‘So, here is what I said: in the period under review, a total of 9,600 patients were treated in the Intensive Care Department. According to the figures you gave us, the proportion of patients discharged from the Intensive Care Department was 83%, up from 79% in the previous year. I’ll continue my analysis of the figures you gave us: Two, the number of patients treated in the Intensive Care Department increased by 8%, indicating an increased demand for intensive care services. Three, the number of patients who could be transferred to general wards rose by a small but significant amount, which reflects a reduction in mortality and a smaller increase in the number of discharges. Four, the combined effect of the increased patient numbers and the greater proportion of patients who could be transferred to the general wards has a tendency to put additional pressure on the general wards.’",
        " The victory against Fulham was not a majestic performance, by any means. After a series of disappointing outings, the curse of United finally came to an end with a mix of solidity and some fine attacking play. But in this first win away from home, there was nothing pre-ordained about the way in which it was achieved. Bruno Fernandes was the captain par excellence, covering every blade of grass, as well as the organization of both attack and defense. United were for long periods under pressure and had to rely on counter attacks and defense. But unlike on other occasions, they were not broken in similar circumstances. We’ve been talking about character for weeks, ten Hag reflected after the game. Today, you saw what it means to stand up for the badge. The defense, so often criticised this season, held firm when it mattered most, with Lisandro Martnez making some vital saves. Now the question is whether this was a genuine turning point or merely a temporary respite in an up-and-down season. The question that remains is whether it was a real turning point, or just a momentary halt in a turbulent campaign. Sometimes you have to win ugly before you can win nicely.",
        " Whilst standing on the hard-shoulder of the carriageway with his wife Ganna (later known as Anna) Pring, who was celebrating his first wedding anniversary, they were on the Kiev-Khop road, and it was getting dark. They were walking back to the restaurant where they had dined to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. They had had a meal at a restaurant near Kiev, in celebration of their first wedding anniversary, and were on their way back to the hotel when they were knocked down by a car, which had a swank of its own. The car never stopped, nor was it ever found, and his death became notorious in England because of the subsequent investigations and the initial inquest, in which it was first declared that the death was unlawful. The car, which was allegedly driving without a headlight, rammed Pring's body so violently that it was thrown forward and he died on the spot. It was an international incident with trials in Ukraine and in England, and the death of Pring remained controversial for many years. His wife, who had gone back to the restaurant a few minutes before the accident to fetch a forgotten glove, became the object of suspicion of his family.",
        " “We have been down this road before,” said Turnbull, referring to the failed 1999 republican referendum that he himself had fought for. A republican himself, Turnbull said that the cause must come from the people and he did not want to see it “put to the sword” by another public defeat. “Constitutional change in Australia is notoriously difficult,” he said. “The next attempt must be driven by genuine public enthusiasm rather than political leadership.” “Again, there must be at least 76% of Australians behind any proposal before we consider a further referendum.”",
        " ‘My father had it some time in the 1960s,’ he said. ‘I was fascinated by it as a child but we never had it on view.’ The flag, which measures some two metres by one and a half, has been examined by experts and it is thought that it could date back to the last quarter of the 19th century and is potentially of great historical value. The flag, which shows some wear at the edges and has faded slightly, is in good condition for its age. ‘It would be a shame to keep it hidden away any longer,’ said Mr Cory. ‘I hope that people can now appreciate its historical value.’ He has now decided to donate the flag to the National Museum Wales, where it will be conserved and further examined before it can be displayed to the public.",
        " “When we fail to intervene early enough, we wait until the condition has worsened significantly,” says Dr. Sarah Chen, a clinical psychologist. “And that has the unfortunate effect of making the treatment less effective, more complicated and more expensive. For example, according to research, early intervention is more effective than late, and it reduces the need for emergency care or hospitalization. But many health systems are still built around a model of crisis management, not prevention. Key obstacles to early intervention include overwhelmed family doctors with little or no mental health training, long waiting lists for specialist appointments, high insurance barriers to accessing care, the stigma that prevents people from seeking help early enough, and a lack of community resources. It’s like ignoring a small leak in a roof until the ceiling collapses.” “Increased mental health awareness is needed to encourage early screening and treatment, as well as to support greater community involvement.”",
        " There is in the Channel a set of stakes driven into the mud in a V, between which wattle partitions were woven. This is an archeological discovery which is dated about 1,400 years, and is one of the oldest and best preserved fish traps ever discovered in England. The fish were driven into the narrow end of the V by the falling tide, where they were easily gathered up. The lords of the wood used to build the weir were felled in the 7th century. It is well preserved because the anaerobic conditions of the mud prevented the wood from decomposing. Since its discovery, efforts have been made to preserve this valuable maritime heritage before the tides could do more damage to it. The weir reveals the skill with which Saxon peoples understood the tidal motion and the movements of fish, enabling them to make use of the exploitation of the sea with the help of a simple technology.",
        " According to the RAC, there are two principal causes of higher prices: the price of crude oil is rising, and this is directly responsible for rising petrol prices. These rising prices are accompanied by a falling pound, which means consumers effectively pay more for the same amount of fuel. Since the pound has weakened considerably since the vote to leave the European Union, the price of petrol is increasing as the currency used to buy it falls. It is not only individual drivers who are affected by such price rises, but also businesses dependent on transport. The RAC may well point out that in the post-Brexit environment the uncertainty over the economy and the increased cost of living are only aggravated.",
        " The rise of the group, also called in the western world ISIS, had been causing, for a while, the students and parents of the Isis Academy in Oxford, a problem for the students, who had difficulties making telephone calls or sending e-mails, because the association with the terrorist group was causing an increasingly confusing effect and not the one that had originally been inspired by the Isis, which is the name of the Thames at Oxford. The name of the school had been changed to Iffley, so as to protect its reputation, its image and its integrity. The new name Iffley Academy, which kept the geographical connection with the local area, was decided by the re-named schools and charities that had adopted the Isis name before the emergence of the militant group, who took on a disastrous connotation, according to the headmaster of the school. The school, whose mission is to serve the needs of children with special needs, wanted to ensure that its image was linked to its educational vocation, not to be overwhelmed by misunderstandings.",
        " Since the middle of 1938, when Winton was on a business trip to Prague, he was deeply affected by the fate of Jewish refugees who had fled the persecution of the Germans after the annexation of the Sudetenland. Realizing the danger the children were in, he began to operate in Prague, and he established an office for the collection of children, the selection of the best families and their transport to England. He spent his free time and after work at the office in London carefully doing all the paperwork, all the travel documents and the police checks. The last and largest transport, scheduled for September 1, 1939, did not start because on that day Germany attacked Poland and World War II began. He and his small staff organized eight transports from March to August 1939, when 669 children were transported from Prague to London. The children of the final transport were lost in the Holocaust, and he was reunited with the now-adult 'Winton children' in the emotional 1989 'This is Your Life' BBC program. For almost fifty years, until his wife found in the attic a record book, photographs and lists of the transported children, people knew little about his humanitarian efforts. It died at the age of 106 in the year 2015, leaving behind an indisputable legacy of love and moral courage. Queen Elizabeth II. honoured him with a knighthood in 2003 for his heroism.",
        " The results of the game, and the scorer’s great hope, is that in spite of their strength and long periods of possession, the strength of their play was too inadequate to save them from defeat. In spite of their constant assault, their exasperating struggles, and slender backs, the home side were scored on, and the result extended the Dons’ unprofitable series at home to twelve matches, which is a serious matter. “It’s a terrible thing to let another lead at home go,” said the manager afterwards. The hero of the match was the visitors’ George Taylor, who in the 87th minute with a neat touch and a tidy shot rescued the day and silenced the increasingly anxious home fans. The home side had taken a two-goal lead in the first half, thanks to goals from JOHNSON and WILLIAMS, only to see the visitors pull one back just before the break. Early in the second half, a series of defensive blunders and Taylor’s supreme acumen saved the day for the visitors. “We created enough chances to win several matches, but our inability to manage our leads is costing us dearly.” In a crucial encounter at the weekend, the Dons must quickly find a solution to their home problem, and the away side, who scored two goals themselves, can feel much more confident.",

        " The fact that the second and third largest cable operators in the United States are negotiating to merge their activities, is in itself a considerable development. The combination would be a major new player in the telecommunications market. It would probably have several important repercussions: the greater strength of the combined company compared to the present market leader; an increase in market concentration; a possible change in negotiating power with content producers; the deal would be subject to scrutiny by the FCC and the Department of Justice; concerns would be raised about a decline in competition and the high degree of concentration in the industry; it would probably lead to higher prices and service fees; would probably cause more concern about concentration and its effects on consumers; it would have a serious impact on the progress of technology and the evolution of the network; it could be subjected to a long-term structural review, with the end goal of further improvements in service and innovation. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects of the proposed merger?",
        " According to his usual custom, Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, visited Brussels this week. He remained firmly convinced that the Protocol, though imperfect, offers the necessary safeguards for the Northern Ireland economy and the Good Friday Agreement. He was also in Brussels in order to seek to ensure that the interests of Northern Ireland were properly represented in the ongoing discussions about the Protocol’s implementation. The SDLP leader linked the current difficulties of the north to the overall constitutional future of the province, and also argued that the economic uncertainties of the time are leading more and more people to think about the prospect of unity. In the past, he had stated that it was a matter of practical solutions, not of ideological stands, and he had criticized the approach of the UK government to the negotiations on the Protocol. He had advocated using the scope of the present Agreement rather than radically re-writing it.",

After this incident they were arrested for a breach of public peace. The case became known worldwide and sparked debate on respect for local customs and holy places when traveling abroad.

        " The Thai golfer had to play the dangerous par-three fifteenth, a long shot over water, a masterly par to keep his lead. Then at the par-four fourteenth, he moved one stroke in front with a perfect putt, from 40 feet, curving round the hole to take the lead at 12 under. As the leaders approached the final holes, the tension mounted. At the par-five seventeenth, he had the decision to make, whether to try and reach the green in two strokes or not. His playing partner, Spain's Sergio Garcia, failed to keep up with the Thai's putting prowess and he missed his birdie attempt at sixteen by a matter of inches. And with thunderclouds gathering overhead, Aphibarnrat knew he was going to have to give everything if he was to win. Meanwhile, up ahead, Johnson and Koepka made a great move.

        " I will continue with some information about the IGas test drilling proposal at Springs Road, Miston, Bassetlaw. The site is close to the former RAF missile silo at Miston Springs in Nottinghamshire. The plan is to test drill for shale gas by hydraulic fracturing. The position of this proposal may have changed since it was last reviewed as UK government policy on fracking has changed in recent years. This proposal has been subject to various planning applications with Nottinghamshire County Council, which is responsible for such decisions. Local residents, environment groups and anti-fracking campaigners have raised concerns about groundwater contamination, increased traffic on rural roads, noise and air pollution, the possibility of earthquakes and the impact on the nearby Miston Carr Nature Reserve, which is a SSSI.

        " A certain star of English football was hired as a temporary coach, until the end of the season in April, and had to give up a point for the season. His first team had a string of defeats and a relegation. The board of directors gave him a few compliments, in the face of difficult circumstances, because the problem was older than his appointment, but also to look for a different permanent coach to come back next season. It seems that the players did not succeed in implementing the tactic and that their morale was worsening. Fans reacted with dissimilar responses, some sympathizing with the difficult situation he inherited, others questioning whether his reputation as a former player had influenced the appointment, while his experience as a coach was little.",
        " To continue its fanciful first announcement, the European Research Centre published a series of amusing photographs of its staff demonstrating the use of the Force in various daily situations. In one of these, Dr Elisabeth Weber appears to be levitating her coffee cup through the laboratory while typing equations with her free hand. Another photo shows Dr Martin Hoffmann – a distance of several meters from the desk – pushing a pile of documents with a perfectly ordered pile. The practical jokes continued with the staff of the ERC showing how they could now reach items on high shelves, open doors while carrying fragile experimental apparatus and even ‘choke’ the printer that always misbehaves. “In the budget negotiations we have found that the Force is especially useful,” Dr Sophia Keller says, as she stands before the camera surrounded by financial officials, apparently trying to pull the brains of the auditors into the spiral. “It’s not budget cuts you’re looking for.” In a statement the director of the European Research Centre, Dr Barbara Braas, admitted that, as he continued to regret that midi-chlorian research remains a work of science fiction, he hoped that the images would still raise the spirits of scientists and Star Wars fans alike.",

His death was announced by his family, who expressed their thanks for the support they had received during a difficult time and announced that a public memorial service would be held in Sydney in the coming weeks. Literary figures from around Australia and the world were quick to express their condolences and remember his significant contribution to Australian literature and his generosity in encouraging new writers. His last book, which came out a few months before his death, was hailed by the critics as a deserved conclusion to his career spanning more than four decades.

        " Consequently, the relationship between the United States and the Republic of China has never been as strong as before. Under the one-China policy, the United States has official relations with the People's Republic of China and has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan. However, through the American Institute in Taiwan, the role of the embassy is the same as before. China considers Taiwan to be inalienable and has never renounced the use of force to reunite with the mainland. In addition, the United States has also provided defensive arms for the Republic of China under the Taiwan Affairs Law, which was passed by Congress in response to the transfer of diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing. This is a delicate diplomatic balance that has been maintained for many years, but it is sometimes shaken by some remarks or the movement that people think is inconsistent with the status quo. The United States is said to have a policy of \"strategic ambiguity\", that is, it never directly stated that it would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, but in the background., and provide some military support.",

In his victory speech, Mr. Khan pledged to be the mayor of all Londoners and to unite the capital’s different communities. His father, a bus driver, drove a bus in London. Khan, who succeeds Boris Johnson, will lead a city of 8 million inhabitants, with important responsibilities for housing, transport, police and economic development. The campaign for mayor was subject to some controversy and criticism for its tone and language.",
        " The increased emphasis in the early morning exercise after the great success of last year has enabled them to keep their strength at the peak. Runcorn, who was twenty-four, became the first Englishman to win this match in the eighteen years of its existence. \"Last year it was a question of proving that I belonged to the top level,\" he said in the pre-match conference, \"this year is about proving that it was not an accident and showing that I am going to leave my mark in the game.\". The result of this is a series of new sponorships that will allow him to devote himself to the game. The qualification rounds would soon show whether the modifications made to the game were enough to challenge the defending champion. The astrologers of the old strongholds have carefully studied Runcorn's technique and are now reworking their own systems, hoping to unseat England's new hero.",
        " I will continue since you asked me to, but I am prevented from obtaining the rest of the article and have no further knowledge of this year’s event. I note that this is a fragment of a newspaper article, presumably about the film premier of a film of the Minions, since the names Bob, Kevin and Stuart are those of the main Minions, and the text speaks of “the yellow carpet,” which must have been a colored carpet arranged for the yellow Minions instead of the usual red carpet. I am prevented from obtaining the rest of the article from the BBC. Assuming it is the BBC, I can at least offer you the following account of what might have happened at the premiere of a film about the Minions.",
        " In the second round of the HEC, Thomas Detry scored a 67, only a stroke behind the leader. As for the second round, Thomas Detry shot a second 67 to remain in the frame of mind. The scoundrel Jamesson's fifth round of 66 equaled his first round of 68, the Swede Bjork followed up his first round of 65 with a solid 67. At the head, after two rounds, both the Scotchman and the Swede were 10 under par. The cut was made at 2 under, so many important golfers were deprived of a second chance, among them former champion Martin Kaymer, who shot a second 73 after a first 72. For the weekend, light winds and a temperature of 27 degrees are expected. Two strokes behind the Swede and the Scotchman, Jordan Smith and Adrian Otaegui, who played quite similarly on the first two rounds, are placed at 8 under. They will be teeing off at 1:50 pm local time on Saturday. Sunday is the final day.",
        " The case of a young girl, Lindsay Rimer, who disappeared from Hebden Bridge, West Riding of Yorkshire, in November of the year 1994, was a real one, a real disappearance, a real murder. Her body was found in the Rochdale Canal about five months later. I am sorry, I haven’t looked into this particular case in more detail. I would like to help you, but without verified facts, I would be obliged to stop, for I am afraid that by adding something fictitious to a real case, I would be spreading an incorrect idea. This was a real criminal case in the United Kingdom. Do you wish to discuss anything more specific about criminal cases in general, or related subjects?",
        " At first glance a 5.2% fall in the week was a considerable event, indicating high market volatility. The FTSE 100 had fallen by 5.2% since Monday, a sharp fall in a short time, and it may be ascribed to a variety of factors: – economic concerns – recent economic data – central bank decisions – disappointing company results – increased geopolitical tensions. – Any major economic event that coincided with the market fall. In order to provide a more detailed analysis, I would need to have more information about the precise timing and any economic event that coincided with this market movement.",
        " At the time of Obama’s inauguration, the economy was bleeding jobs at a terrifying rate: about 700,000 per month during the depths of the Great Recession. In fact, many economists would choose the nonfarm employment chart to illustrate the economic story of the Obama presidency. In this single chart, the Obama legacy can be seen: he took an economy in free fall, stimulated it, and oversaw a gradual but solid rebuilding of the labor market. The graph shows the very negative numbers in early 2009, then the gradual rise into positive territory, and finally, an impressive, 75-month-long expansion of the job market by the time Obama left office, the longest such expansion in U.S. history. The nonfarm employment chart shows the Obama presidency’s most important story, a historic crisis, then a lasting recovery that set the foundation for the economy he would leave his successor. The steady progress of the recovery was both an accomplishment and a burden, because many Americans felt that despite the improving numbers, they were not doing well.",
        " The bare-looking stands at the King Power Stadium were explained by a bad traffic jam, which delayed the access of many fans to the stadium. Leicester City admitted the incident, and explained that the congestion was caused by a weeknight game in the middle of the week, when all the roads were under repair. The beginning of the third round of the cup, a rematch with Tottenham Hotspur, showed hundreds of empty seats and a crowd that could not begin the game. In the end, the club apologized and promised to work with the authorities to improve traffic conditions in the area for future evening matches. Despite the attendance, there was an exciting game for the few fans who were able to get into the stands, and the atmosphere increased as the stands filled up during the first half. Angry supporters posted their desperation on social networks, complaining that they had been stuck in traffic for more than an hour less than a mile from the stadium. But apart from the traffic jam, both teams saw the match as an important opportunity for their cup dreams, and despite their extremely tight schedules in the Premier League, the teams were almost all strong.",
        " ‘This is not about party politics,’ the Minister declared. He explained that to address the issues facing the governance of Wales and ensure that devolved powers are used effectively, cross-party co-operation is essential. He added that the Government was inviting the other political parties to a discussion on how best to secure for Wales the best possible devolution settlement. ‘This announcement comes at a time when the future of devolution is being discussed across the United Kingdom. It is about creating a framework which serves the people of Wales and strengthens the Union. We need to examine what is working well and what needs improvement.’ The discussions are expected to cover areas such as the fiscal framework, capital investment, the division of responsibilities between the United Kingdom and the National Assembly, and how powers are divided up between the two as the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. The opposition parties cautiously welcomed the invitation but were unsure what the Government’s true intentions were. A spokesman for the Welsh Labour Party said they would be part of the discussions but that they would ‘vigorously defend the current devolution settlement against any attempt to roll it back’.",
        " An accident in Dumfries and Galloway has highlighted the hazards of transporting huge wind-turbine parts along country roads. The lorry, laden with a massive generator component, got stuck on a sharp bend near [place name], causing considerable disruption to traffic on the country lane. The police were called in to the scene to deal with the incident, which required special equipment to clear. The accident has sparked renewed debate on the provision of roads for new wind farms in remote locations. The lorry, which measured around [length of vehicle] metres in length, was trying to navigate the twisting roads that lead to a local wind farm. A spokeswoman for the transport company said: “Transporting parts for new renewables projects presents a unique set of challenges, particularly in rural areas that were not designed to accommodate vehicles of this size.” The police warned that diversions would be in place for a considerable period while the recovery work continued. Community representatives have expressed concerns about the suitability of local roads for such large-scale transport operations.",

It is a fragment of a text saying that the school receives money, but it ends with \"go towards the purchase of a Play Station 3,\" which seems either incomplete or confused. Would you like me to find out about the school? Would you like me to find out about the students? The school usually receives funds to improve educational facilities, agricultural programs, and facilities on campus, but I don't think the school has a gaming console like a Play Station 3.

        " “I am sixty-four years old,” he said, “and I have studied the story of the Alamo since my boyhood. I’ve been fascinated by the invincible stand of those men against overwhelming odds since I was a child.” “People forget that they were not just characters in a story but real men, with real hopes and fears,” he went on, adjusting his glasses. “For years I have collected documents, combed archives, and spent countless hours in trying to sort out the truth from the legend.” He ran his weathered hand along the old limestone walls and felt himself in close contact with the past, in close contact with history that extended back almost two centuries. The shadows of the plaza were a long way off, and he was surrounded by tourists who did not know that the venerable old gentleman had devoted his retired life to preserving the authentic story of the thirteen days of March, 1836.",

        " The price, after falling in the morning session to less than four and a half crowns, mounted slowly and rose till it reached above five, the upswing of which was so marked as to amount to a reversal of more than four per cent. The day's trading was marked by extreme fluctuations; the lower limit of the price of the shares was about four and a half crowns, a point which greatly alarmed some on the exchange; but the price, after a gradual rise, had climbed to five. The turnover of shares was rather higher than usual, and during this sharp upswing in the price of the shares, the interest of the market in the shares increased. The downward movement of the shares in the morning was attributed by some to a withdrawal from the previous day's gains, and the lowering of the price of a recent release. The afternoon rally may have been occasioned by a feeling of profit-taking in view of the fall, together with a general reaction in the market. They will now watch carefully to see if the reaction can be maintained in the next session.",
        " The International Association of Associations, the board that regulates the laws of the game, has just passed a law for the game which will be used in the next tournaments and is intended to address long-standing concerns over the fairness of the game, the safety of the players and the officiating of the match. The law will first be tested in selected tournaments before possibly being adapted to the entire world game. The members of the IFAB, which consists of the four British associations, voted unanimously for the change. After careful consultation with all the interested parties, players, coaches, referees and fans, the members of the IFAB believed that this amendment would benefit the game at all levels. The IFAB meets every year to discuss and vote on potential changes to the laws of the game and to ensure that the rules evolve while preserving the integrity and spirit of the game.

According to X Lab, this represents a significant step towards making balloon-based Internet economically viable in remote and underdeveloped regions of the world.",
        " The experienced midfielder brings a wealth of experience with him, having played at clubs like Hibernian and Academical during his career in Scottish football. It is expected that his arrival at Stark’s Park will provide Ian Murray with additional strength in the middle of the park as the club aims to build on last season’s success. Last season, Martin’s 38 appearances and five goals for Livingston showed his value to the team as they finished a creditable sixth in the SPL, a place above that finished sixth by the previous season. “I am absolutely delighted to have joined the club,” said Martin after signing the contract, “and after talking to the manager and seeing the plan he had for the team I was convinced that it was the right move for me. I’m really looking forward to being a part of the build-up.” – And, to Murray’s words: “Martin’s arrival is a major boost for us. He knows what is needed to compete at the highest level, and his abilities on and off the field will be invaluable as we push forward into the SPL.”",

The electoral commissioners whose rivalries had been made clearer had got into a fight. These clashes have brought the electoral commission to the point where its ability to carry out a fair and transparent election is called into question. The chairman of the commission asked for mediation, the opposition parties wanted an independent inquiry into the functioning of the commission. The fights show a lack of decorum in the middle of the authorities in charge of the democratic game. These fights are a breach of the chain of command of the officials responsible for ensuring the rule of law.",

Bird-watchers may see: More than 200,000 gannets, the largest colony on the British mainland, Thousands of puffins, guillemots, razorbills, and fulmars, The puffins are breeding in the only place in England where they nest on the land. The RSPB is keeping an eye on the birds. The kittiwakes are falling away, partly as a result of climate change and as a result of fishing practices. But there are no red data on gannets, fulmars, puffins, or fulmars, as the species is not found in Denmark.

The gendarmes have taken the narcotic into evidence and are awaiting further investigations to determine whether charges should be laid. Despite the very small quantity, any possession of cocaine is still a crime.",

Oldham’s lead inspired them, and they dominated the first part of the game. The side from Alcaices seemed demoralized by their early setback, and in the midfield dominated the tempo of the game. On the 34th minute, however, against the run of play, Alcaices equalized. At the stroke of the half hour, the rivals gradually gained confidence and, in a rapid rush, a low drive from the edge of the penalty area forced Zeus de la Paz, the goalkeeper of the homonyms, to snatch the ball from the foot of the shooter. The teams entered the intermission tied 1-1. On the left wing a corner-kick that the defenders of Oldham did not clear. In the scrum, a central player from the rival team was able to score.",

Hughie Maughan, who danced on an Irish dancing contest on a TV show, was an unexpected topic of conversation when he appeared on a tv program with an extremely tanned complexion. Many were surprised at the depth of his tan.

Embryo, in which the mother and father have the same nuclei, the donor's is still a little. The Times reports: The new technique, which is an important step forward in the field of assisted reproduction, has raised moral questions and has stirred up discussions about the manipulation of the germ cells. This technique was developed for women with defective mitochondrion, so that they could have healthy children without transmitting the disease to their offspring. The baby is now called \"three-parent\" - it contains only a small part of the donor's egg and only the mitochondria, the 0.1% of the whole egg. At the same time, this technology is subject to the laws of different states. Some countries allow it for certain medical purposes, others do not allow it at all.",

A preliminary investigation shows that the smoke was caused by an electrical fault behind one of the shops. \"The safety of our customers and employees is our top priority,\" a spokeswoman for the Westmorland Center said. The fire service deployed four vehicles to the scene, with firefighters in breathing apparatus going into the affected area.

        " For indeed, in September last, the Reverend Gavin Ashenden had resigned his post as Queen’s Chaplain, saying he was unable to perform the duties of his office while speaking out against theological compromises in the Anglican Church. The reason for his resignation was a public statement he had made against a ceremony at St. Mary’s Cathedral in Glasgow, in which passages from the Koran were read at Epiphany services. Ashenden has remained a staunch defender of conservative religious opinions and has published articles and made appearances on the radio and on the news-television programmes voicing his concerns about the direction the Anglican Church was taking. After his resignation, Ashenden continued to be a leading commentator on religion and, after converting to Roman Catholicism, was ordained as a Catholic priest. He became a useful example of the tensions that exist between the traditional and the liberal forces in the Church of England.",

        " In the first game on Saturday, they found it difficult to get into the game against a well-drilled team which took advantage of early mistakes in defense. The local team lost both its matches in the finals in Nottingham over the weekend. It was a creditable performance in the face of the older opposition. The captain, Sebastian Neal, said that the results were disappointing, but that the experience was invaluable for the future. They learned a lot about the competition and the need for improvements. The second match on Sunday was equally tough and the Tayside team again showed some signs of promise, but lacked in the crucial moments. The team will now go to work and the next games in the league. They hope that this competition will serve them well in the development. Despite the defeat, the coaches were positive and noted the progress that had been made in reaching the finals and the promise shown by several young players who were now experiencing the highest level of competition.",

        " There are several explanations for this change. The sale of state-owned houses in the year ended in March last constituted a noticeable reversal of the previous decline; this rise in a very long-standing decline gives rise to some questions. This trend is significant for housing provision, especially for lower-income households, which usually depend on state-owned housing. Changes in housing policy, the housing price situation, or the availability of mortgages may have contributed to the increase in the number of sales. It could also be a strategic decision of the State to reduce the housing stock or increase the income. We need to do more research to see whether this increase is widespread or whether it is confined to certain regions, whether it is due to changes in policy or market conditions. If it is a new trend rather than a temporary change, this could have significant consequences for the provision of state-owned housing.",

Three Americans, Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler and Spencer Stone, were together with the Englishman, Chris Norman, to whom the weapon was to be handed over, showed courage and quickness of reaction. The thwarted attempt on his life by Ezzedine Khazzani was later convicted in a French court of terrorism and, in December 2021, was condemned to life imprisonment.

        " They argued that their wages had been reduced when the council's cleaning contractor, C&D Services, had taken over the contract from the school, and they asserted that such reductions were in contravention of the principle of equal pay. The tribunal found in favour of the claimants and held that the differences in pay were not justified by any market-based factors. The women claimed that their hourly rate had been reduced from £7.85 to the minimum wage, and that their working hours had been reduced too. This case drew attention to the existing concerns that have been expressed about the way in which female-dominated professions such as cleaning and catering are affected by the transfer of work to external contractors. The company was instructed to restore the women's previous wages and pay back-pay for the period since the change in contract.",
        " Greig Laidlaw dominated the game with his experienced presence, a quick service from the ruck, and intelligent tactic. In this way he was able to set up the defense. The expert scrum-half, who scored eight tries and commanded the entire victory in the pool B game against Japan, had a high degree of mastery. The victory gave Scotland an important momentum for the tournament and, with Laidlaw's form, bodes well for the upcoming matches in Pool B. His leadership was shown in all difficult periods, and the valuable victory marked the start of the pool B series.",
        " A boy of fifteen years old, the BBC report says, has used an ingenious method of survival. By drinking water from his wet clothes, he seems to have used a common technique for extracting water from wet clothing by sucking it or squeezing it into his mouth. It was an old report, which could well be included in the BBC’s current reports on survival, which emphasize both human endurance and the difficult situations that people face around the world. The boy’s ingenuity shows how people can survive, even young people, with the help of the resources that are at hand. It is not clear from the omission of more details whether this survival situation was caused by natural disasters, wanderings in the wilderness, or displacements caused by warfare.",

It was the Easter recess that Judge Thokozile Masipa wished the legal teams to be well prepared, probably to ensure the effective running of the trial when the proceedings recommence. If you wish me to be more specific about the trial you are referring to, or about any particular aspect of the trial, I should need to know.

It is, I suppose, a case of human trafficking, and was apparently caused by a traffic in human beings. I will add that I know nothing of this case beyond what you have said. I will not express an opinion of the details of this case without further information.

        " A criminal investigation was subsequently opened by the American justice department, which alleged wire fraud, money laundering and bribery with regard to the management of FIFA and the allocation of the merchandising and media rights of the international football tournaments. In May, fourteen officials and marketing companies were accused of racketeering in the United States, and in connection with the alleged embezzlement of more than 150 million dollars. The arrests of high-ranking officials in Zurich, just before the annual meeting of the World Cup, led to calls for a complete reform of the organization, and under severe pressure to then president Sepp Blatter, who was first re-elected a few days after the scandal broke, and who a few days later announced his resignation. The indictment thus revealed the complete corruption of the world football organization over many years. In an unprecedented intervention of the United States in the affairs of an international sports organization, investigations were also initiated in several countries as to the business practices and decision-making processes within FIFA.",

        " Physicists in the United States have succeeded in preparing silicon-28 with an unprecedented degree of purity—four times the current level. This is an extremely important achievement in materials science and could have far-reaching consequences. Pure silicon-28 has superior properties to natural silicon, which is a mixture of isotopes—silicon-28, silicon-29, and silicon-30. New methods of producing the material have presumably been developed to overcome the previous limitations on the rate of production. The lack of the other isotopes makes silicon-28 a particularly good material for storing information in the form of a qubit (quantum bit). This research is a major step forward in silicon technology and has the potential to open up new fields in materials science and information technology. There are also possibilities for the preparation of ultra-pure silicon-28 for use in precision measurement, the manufacture of semiconductors, and fundamental physics research.",
        " After the interval Bath pushed hard for a winner, and the United strikers, Frankie Artus and Andy Watkins, both went close to the mark. However, the loss of their tenth man was not the least; and five minutes before half-time, with only ten men, Aldershot equalised when Scott Rendell, sent up to meet a cross from Matt McClure, headed the ball home. The game finished 1-1, a decent result for Aldershot, who had played for more than an hour with only ten men. Aldershot defended resolutely, though their keeper Phil Smith was called upon several times to save the point for the visitors.",
        " The volunteer mountain rescue team that covers Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) in the Snowdonia National Park, has reported that the unprecedented number of rescues has placed extreme pressure on their resources and personnel. Team managers are alarmed that the increasing popularity of outdoor activities, combined with an increase in people unprepared for mountain conditions, has led to a dramatic rise in emergencies. The August surge was termed unsustainable by the mountain rescue team. The team highlighted common issues causing call-outs, including lack of adequate footwear, clothing, equipment and water. “Our volunteers have full-time jobs and families, but they are being called out many times a week,” said a spokesman. “This level of demand cannot continue without further support or steps to reduce incidents.” The local authority is now considering ways to increase public awareness of safety issues, with better guidance for visitors and signs on popular routes. Management measures to manage visitor numbers during busy periods, as seen in other national parks, are also under consideration. Many of the incidents were caused by people underestimating the mountain’s demanding terrain and unpredictable weather.",
        " The 28-year-old Swede, who has two caps for his country, has found a new home after being released from his club in the English first division last month. “I am delighted to be joining such a prestigious club,” he said yesterday after his medical. “Having been out of contract for a few weeks I have had a lot of free time. I am pleased to have found a new club, with high ambitions.” The director of football at X said he was very pleased with the new player’s arrival: “We have been following his career very closely since he became available. With his experience of English football and his international pedigree he will add a lot to our defence.” He will be available for selection from today and may be in the squad for the upcoming match against Z. During his time in the English first division the Swedish defender made 47 appearances and was a reliable player known for his aerial skills and ability to control the ball.",

        " This was the first time in our country where a gathering of women religious scholars, the first meeting of its kind, was held to interpret the religious texts and issue fatwas. The fatwas, though not legally binding, will be of influence. The organisers hope that it will set a precedent for the more effective participation of women in the religious decision-making process. The fatwas deal with child marriage, domestic violence, the right to education and work for women, viewed from the angle of Islamic law. The participants are engaged in the most difficult theological debate, focusing on Islamic principles of justice and human dignity. These ideas are a source of hope for local women's rights activists. The activists cautiously welcome the fatwas, pointing out that they provide cultural legitimacy for the struggle for women's rights.",
        " The newspaper stated in the lead paragraph: “THOUSANDS OF HOMES COULD BE ELIMINATED FROM THE BEDROOM TAX BENEFIT, the minister warns. Minister Paul Givan issued a stark warning that up to 34,000 homes in Northern Ireland may be excluded from the £91 million in funding to be set aside to mitigate the effects of the controversial bedroom tax over the next four years. The policy has been introduced elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Province has introduced a mitigation package to protect vulnerable households. “We have the money, but ensuring it reaches those who need it most is the challenge,” the minister warned. “Without proper uptake this money will not have the desired effect of protecting our most vulnerable citizens. This is why the Department for the Community is planning a major publicity drive to ensure that people in eligible households make claims before the deadlines for implementation.

        " The collision happened when the truck of John Graham crossed the central line of the highway and struck a car in the opposite direction. This collision killed one person on the spot and caused two others serious injuries. For this, the young man was sentenced to three years in prison. The judge spoke of \"a tragic breach of the confidence placed in professional drivers,\" pointing out that the accident could have been avoided by following the recommended rest periods. During the trial, it was learned that he had been sleeping at the wheel, having overworked himself, and that, in the weeks preceding the accident, he had falsified the figures on his tachograph. To this prison sentence was added a five-year driving ban, to be followed by an extended examination.",

Born in Inverness, Scotland, Karen Gillan, in her first appearance in the Doctor Who series, was cast as the companion of the Eleventh Doctor Matt Smith and starred alongside him until 2013. Her popularity with the public was raised further with the series’ success. Her career went on with roles in movies like Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and its sequel, in which she starred alongside The Rock and Kevin Hart, and she also ventured into directing and writing in the movie The Party’s Just Beginning. Then she came to international attention with her role as Nebula in the Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and in the Avengers: Age of Ultron. Gillan has shown a great versatility as an actress, going from the small screen to big movies and independent productions, and establishing herself as a talented performer well beyond her Scottish roots.",

        " “A little odd thing,” said Sergeant Davies, holding the little bear up for all to see. It was a little bear no more than six inches tall, wearing a miniature Metropolitan Police uniform, with a tiny hat atop its head. The officer explained that he had found this animal toy, which was a black bear, wearing a police uniform in the City of London. They all crowded around the bear, which had been dressed in a uniform with a high degree of accuracy. “It was lying at the office counter when I came in this morning. No note, nothing on the closed circuit cameras. No one could have been responsible for leaving it.” The most puzzling thing was how it could have got into the police station in the course of the night. “The quality of the finishing is amazing,” said Policeman Phillips. “Just look at the badge—exactly to scale.” They did not know that it was the first of many similar toys which were going to appear in the various police stations in the coming weeks, as a small silent gift to the police from an anonymous admirer. It had obviously taken someone some time to create this little policeman and leave it where it was to be found.",
        " Before his arrival at the field, the youngster, born in June, was developed at the Ligue 2 club where he was destined to play, and then came to England in the hope of making his way into the English League. He was transferred to Leyton Orient, where he played in a relegation game in the Championship in the season '16-'17, but was subsequently discarded by the club in its financial difficulties and in its administrative upheaval. In the end, he spoke of this time at the Orient as both difficult and formative, and he explained that the experience of fighting against relegation, although unsuccessful, had shaped his game and his courage.. After his departure from the Orient, he played a season in a non-league team, trying to rebuild his career and preparing for his coach's diploma.",
        " On Tuesday, at about 8:30 P.M., the police were called to the scene of a robbery at the corner of Windsor Avenue and Oak Street. According to police, the robber approached the victim with what looked like a kitchen knife with a six-inch blade. The victim was threatened with a knife and was compelled to give up some money. The suspect was a man in his twenties, wearing a black mask and dark clothing. “We’re going to be going over surveillance tapes from the surrounding businesses and urge any witnesses to contact us,” said Inspector Sarah Collins, the police spokeswoman. After making the demand for cash, the robber fled on foot, heading east toward the park. Police have stepped up patrols in the area and ask residents to remain vigilant. The victim, whose name is being withheld for his own protection, was not physically harmed but was left shaken. Anyone with information is urged to contact the nearest police station and mention the RC-29774 case.",
        " The second half was played from one end to the other, with both keepers being called into action several times. The underdogs, in no way intimidated by a team that had not been beaten in this competition for the past twenty-five years, were gaining in confidence as the game progressed. Midway through the first half, the favourites were caught out by a well-worked move from the opponents that produced an equalizer. A couple of minutes before the end of the game, a defensive lapse gave the underdogs the opportunity to counter-attack at speed. The favourites were doing their utmost to score a second, determined not to let the day pass them by. Their technical superiority was unquestionable, but the organization and resolve of their opponents thwarted them. A perfectly executed pass found their striker in space, who calmly steered the ball home past the keeper. It was a sensational finish, with the favourites throwing everyone forward, even the keeper for a last-minute corner, but to no avail. The final whistle sounded, confirming one of the greatest upsets in the history of the competition and the end of a twenty-four-year reign of the favourites.",

        " The European Commission decided to prohibit the French State from supporting the maritime company Sea France, and the Paris Trade Court was called upon to settle this affair. In the latter part of the year of 2011 the Court was informed of the intention of the European Commission to prevent the French government from intervening in the case; but the Court ordered the company to continue its traffic while it scouted for a buyer. In the course of the year of 2012 the Court finally rejected all offers, and ordered the liquidation of Sea France. Its workers, mainly Calais, lost their jobs. The case of Sea France constituted a conflict between the national interest in keeping jobs and strategic traffic in the area. This new enterprise began under the name of My Ferry Link, and drew the ire of the opposition of competitors who objected to the growing predominance of the Tunnel.",

The chairman of the inquest, Maria Voisin, declared that during the few hours preceding the death of Rohan Rhodes, he should have had three blood tests. The inquest examined whether these omitted tests could have given information that could have warned of the deterioration of his condition sooner, and perhaps made it possible to save him. According to the inquest, the blood tests missed represented a critical gap in the observation of his condition.",

This phenomenon can be expected to modify considerably the meteorological conditions of the globe; and to aggravate droughts in some parts and to exasperate floods in others. The south of Australia, South-East Asia, and Africa, especially in South Africa, may experience extreme droughts; the northern parts of Brazil and Colombia will probably suffer from a lack of rain. In the southern United States, especially in California, increased rainfall is expected; and in East Africa unusually heavy rains may cause floods and epidemics.",
        " Most sharks have no interest in attacking man. The reputation acquired by sharks through movies like Jaws is not deserved. Shark attacks on people are extremely rare. Statistics prove this. In the course of a year five to ten people die from shark attacks, as compared with the millions of people who bathe in the oceans. It is more likely to be killed by lightning, a dog, or a falling coconut than by a shark. Many shark attacks are due to a misidentification, for example when a shark mistakenly grazes on a swimmer or a surfer, often a seal, in muddy water. At the same time, these few shark attacks have led to an exaggerated feeling of danger that has unfortunately led to a hampered conservation, at a time when shark populations are seriously depleted. Indeed, many shark species are very shy and try to avoid human contact, as the scientists and divers who study them know.",

        " The plane, believed to be a Beechcraft King Air 500, which had taken off, was a charter, and the engines failed. It crashed at the DFO store in Melbourne. Four Americans and the pilot were among the dead. The authorities in Australia launched an investigation into the accident, and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau examined the wreckage and flight data to determine the exact cause of the accident. Fortunately, the store was not open to the public, so there were no casualties on the ground. The incident was described as the worst in civil aviation in Victoria for nearly 30 years. The accident prompted an inspection of the operation of flights at the Essendon airport, which is surrounded by residential and commercial areas. The four American tourists were supposedly heading to King Island for a golf trip.",
        " This second reduction in the deposit rate is in line with the market expectations, and the statement was anticipated by most of the forecasters. The ECB cut its deposit rate by the minimum 0.25 per cent, to a minimum of 3.5 per cent from 3.7 per cent. In the latest macroeconomic forecasts, the Council slightly revised down its inflation expectations for 2024 and 2025, gradually approaching the 2 per cent target over the medium term. Christine Lagarde pointed out that inflation has been falling in the past weeks, but the ECB is reluctant to announce the defeat of the rise in prices too early. In the immediate aftermath of the announcement, the single currency was barely affected, because the decision was expected. The market is now looking at the forward guidance and the prospects of further rate cuts in the coming months.",

        " The chief aim of the survey is to lay bare to the general public the remarkable health-giving effects of regular mountain-climbing. The effect is to enhance physical and mental health. The combination of the heart-expanding influences, the exposure to the great outdoors, and the gratifying sense of a mental goal is a very powerful combination of means, he explains, to promote health. His own findings show that the varied surfaces of the mountain-paths stimulate the whole of the body and the mind in such a way that he calls it moving meditation. “We are made to go on varied surfaces,” he says, “and our present infatuation with flat, predictable surfaces, with their physical comforts, robs our bodies of a valuable bio-mechanic challenge.” The view changes constantly as one climbs and this seems to stimulate the neural pathways of the brain to do with the solving of problems and the meeting of obstacles. And if the person is without a mountain nearby he suggests substitutes: climbing the stairs, climbing the incline, or even mountain simulators, which give the effect of a virtual experience of a real climb.",

Fosun is offering 451 million euros for the business, of which the Esprito Santo family holds 51%. This sale, if it comes to fruition, will involve the approval of the Portuguese and European regulatory authorities. This deal will mark the acquisition by Chinese investors of a prestigious Portuguese business with a long history.

        " Financial experts noted that while the government's intention to reduce its stake in the company was expected, the announcement's timing and scope had been a surprise to many investors. Shares in the 80 per cent taxpayer-owned bank fell by 3 per cent, in response to the announcement, and £ 1.1 billion was wiped off its market value. Opposition politicians questioned whether the timing of the sale was good and suggested that the government would not recover the full value of its investment. But government ministers insisted that the bank had been substantially restructured since the crisis and was now ready to return to private ownership. The Treasury said the sale would be conducted in several stages to avoid causing too much disruption, and that it would be pitched at institutions first, before allowing smaller investors to buy later. The bank's chief executive, Philip New, said the sale was a vote of confidence in his strategy and the progress the bank had made in improving its balance sheet and its services to customers.",

She had dismissed as mere gossip the story of a disagreement over fiscal policy with the chancellor, and repeated her familiar phrase from her campaign to become prime minister: I don’t give a damn about what you read. The rumor said there had been a few tense moments during the dinner, specifically concerning the forthcoming budget priorities. “The chancellor and I are working together closely on economic stability, and what matters is not what we say at the table, but what we do for the British people.” Opposition politicians, however, pounced on the rumor, and the shadow chancellor called it “more proof that the government is failing to provide the economic leadership we need.” At the same time, both the Prime Minister’s Office and the Treasury issued statements pointing out their “close working relationship” and their “shared vision of the economy.”",

        " Bishop Geoffrey Robinson, formerly auxiliary bishop of Sydney, Australia, testified before a parliamentary committee on the culpability of the Church in the treatment of the victims of sexual abuse. Robinson had previously been one of the leaders in the campaign to reform the Church’s policy on abuse. He spoke to the committee about the institutional failures that had allowed the abuse to continue and about the resistance to acknowledging the true scale of the problem. Robinson, probably during his testimony, referred to the systemic factors that allowed abuse to occur and criticized the institution’s reluctance to acknowledge the full scope of the problem. Among his many publications on the topic is the book Confronting Power and Sex in the Catholic Church, which argues for a radical reform of the Church’s administrative structure and its sexuality policy.",

The whole train turned over, and several of the carriages overturned. The ambulance service, the fire service, and the police were all at the scene immediately. There will be an investigation into the cause of the accident. At first it was stated that about twenty-five people were slightly to moderately injured, and that three were taken to the hospital with serious but none mortal wounds. The railway line between Leuven and Brussels was temporarily interrupted and replaced by buses. Travellers are asked to follow the national railway company for information about the disruption and about the possibilities for alternative travel. The initial assumption is that a defect in the track or a fault in the swivel mechanism is responsible, but the railway company itself warns against any firm conclusions.",

Under his leadership, the club not only succeeded in becoming a long-term team of the English First Division, but also achieved considerable success in European competitions, as witnessed by the two memorable UEFA Cup campaigns. Apart from his on-field achievements, he was committed to strengthening community ties and developing youth players, which still contributed to the success of the first team. In addition, the club's stadium underwent considerable renovations in this period, which made it a more modern and convenient place for the fans, while still retaining its historic nature. When he stepped down as chairman, he left behind a club that was much stronger than it was before, a reputation for stability and achievement that continues to this day.",

Ismay, who had been a prison officer for twenty-eight years, was also a volunteer for the St. John Ambulance. This attack was committed at a time of heightened tension in the neighborhood of the hundredth anniversary of the Easter Rising of 1916.

The scheme will initially place bike-stations at strategic points in the region, where they will be available to be used for short rides by members of the scheme, or by using a credit card or pay-as-you-go system. The first bike-share system in Scotland, the £150,000 bike2go project will provide bikes at key points throughout the area served, and users can hire bicycles for short distances using a credit card or a pay-as-you-go system. Their success will be closely followed, with data gathered about use and mobility to help local authorities with future transport planning. The bicycles have been designed to be comfortable, durable and easily identified. Despite initial enthusiasm, the project faced several challenges, including: • bad weather affecting usage • localized limitations in some areas • maintenance and redistribution costs • competition from private transport services The experience of bike2go influenced the development of other bicycle-sharing schemes in Scotland, contributing to the country’s efforts to reduce its carbon emissions and create more liveable cities.",
        " I will continue with the subject of taxes. Here it is, 7 people pay less tax than they ought, and could be punished, 13 people pay more than they ought, and thereby give interest-free loans to the government. The 7 who pay too little should examine their position at once, so as to avoid the repercussions of a possible fine, interest, and other problems with the tax authorities. The 13 who pay too much should consider adjusting their estimated and withholding taxes to the correct level. In the meantime, is there any aspect of this tax imbalance you would like me to delve into further?",
        " But Klopp is preparing a new plan. Firmino, the quarter-centurion, is with the Belgians in the European Championship, but he has had little play at Liverpool under Klopp, who was appointed coach last October. A man of this type has many facets. According to the Sun, the Liverpool manager is open to offers for Firmino, and the club is already looking to recruit several players for a pressing game, in a style that Klopp believes is appropriate. Several European clubs are watching him, including Germany and Italy. After the tournament, we'll see what happens, but I would like to play a lot wherever I go next season.

        " It was the night of July 1, 1926, that Shaun Whiter, who was then 27 years old and was playing for Newmarket Town, went to help a friend, the soccer player Joey Abbs, to change a flat tire on the Dullingham road near Newmarket, when they were rushing at the side of the road. a Ford, driven by Jan Adamec, a collision occurred, pinning Whiter between the two cars, which eventually caused him to lose both legs. Adamec fled, but was later arrested and in September he was sentenced to 40 months in prison for causing serious bodily injury. He also admitted driving dangerously, in which he had injured the legs of Abbs, but less than those of Whiter. Then, despite his life-changing injury, Shaun Whiter proved to be strong. The football community rallied around him, setting up charity matches and other ways to support the recovery and rehabilitation of the injured player. He was also banned from driving for five years. Against all odds, he recovered with a new lease of life, learned to walk with prostheses and even played in some sporting events. Ipswich Town, Cambridge United and other local clubs also participated in this charity.",
        " Councillors are not pleased with the fact that Ordnance Survey maps, on which they are delineated, give the name of Black Rock Sands, near Porthmadog, by the English name, and omit its Welsh designation. They are irritated that this disgraces the Welsh heritage and the local language. It is part of the old conflict between English and Welsh, between old and new. It is a question of respect for the bilingual community and the fidelity to old and established names. Many of the local inhabitants know the Welsh name, which is historic and local. The plan is to ask the Ordnance Survey for a future edition of the map to give both the English and the Welsh names. This would represent the bilingualism of the district and its cultural heritage.",

Judge Caroline Thompson said that they had operated a bogus exchange that offered substantial returns on cryptocurrencies. Judge Caroline Thompson said that they had “calculated and ruthless” with their victims. The judge remarked that they had caused “devastating” damage to their victims.

The letter referred to the dangers of trade friction, regulatory uncertainty and the disruption of trans-border production chains. She pointed out that businesses were already delaying investment plans and preparing for lay-offs. The conclusion of the letter was that the negotiation process must be made clearer and that the British government must communicate its long-term vision for the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union after the exit, pointing out that parliamentary control would be necessary to ensure that the national interest was served.",

Aled, a para-athlete from Wales, set the bar high for his competitors and showed off his skill and strength with a world-class performance in the finals. The performance was also a world record. Aled remarked on the podium that he had known that he would win, and he had been feeling pretty confident ever since he won the shot put. “It was a special feeling, winning the world record, and the gold medal,” said the para-athlete. Aled, one of the most dependable throwers in the world, confirmed once again that he is the one to beat in both disciplines. The British Paralympic team continues to perform very well in the track and field events, and Davies’s achievements show just how strong the British are in the field events. Aled’s coach praised his dedication and his super-excellent preparation. This double gold medal adds to his Paralympic record, he now has gold medals from several different Paralympics.",

        " For example, “Sarah Johnson, the director of digital strategy, noted that there is a shift from quantity to quality in the interaction of social media. ” Brands now emphasize meaningful interactions rather than vanity metrics, said James Chen, the senior specialist of artificial intelligence, “The personalization technology has become more and more sophisticated.” It is expected that more and more content will be delivered to the mobile terminals, and that the industry is expected to surpass celebrities, a micro-influencer, who has a high degree of influence over the community. It is a long way to go. Then, according to them, the trend will be as follows: Influencers will use more augmented reality and virtual reality in their marketing efforts. There will be more and more social commerce and shopping journeys. There will be more and more sophisticated ways to track the effectiveness of influencer marketing. The awareness of ethics and transparency will be deeper.",

As you state, Dale Merza, 20, was charged with a misdemeanor in the case of a hazing case, which involved a fatal fight with the unfortunate Andy Seeley, 19, at Central Michigan University in October (which must have been a year before the occurrence of this case). If you would like to learn more about this case, I would recommend that you turn to the local media and to the court records in that region. The hazings that occur on college and university grounds can involve risks and even injuries, and this can sometimes lead to legal consequences. Many universities have strict anti-hazing rules, and depending on the jurisdiction, hazing can be subject to criminal charges when it involves harmful behavior.",

Mr Corbyn told the BBC that it was ‘the party’ which would decide the question and it was for the party to decide it in conjunction with its members and supporters. The statement was probably made in connection with some question of policy or the party’s manifesto during the period from which he was leader of the Labour Party between 2015 and 2020. The words were in accordance with Mr Corbyn’s own attitude to leadership, which tended to emphasise the grassroots of the party and collective decision-making rather than a purely centralised authority.",
        " A tremor in the carotid artery is responsible for the pain and tingling that some of these patients experience, which is why they should be checked by a neurologist immediately, and the chest X-rays should be taken immediately if the patient has no symptoms, so that he may not be misdiagnosed. This is the first sign of a disease in its first stages. The disease, in its earliest stages, is generally asymptomatic. That is why screening and early diagnosis are so important. Almost 80% of these cancers are diagnosed in their early stages, when they are most easily treatable. If symptoms appear, they may include the following: difficulty in urinating; a weak, painful, erectile stream; increased frequency of urination, especially at night; blood in the urine or sexual discharge; a burning sensation during urination.",

His innings, which lasted over nine hours, rescued a hopeless position into the realms of possibility, when the England batsmen were already running on all cylinders. He was then playing his first game for South Africa for three years, and was in very poor form, but with a double century he overthrew the odds and led the South Africans on the homeward march. \"This is the most important innings of my career,\" he told reporters. \"I had lost confidence in my form. I had always believed I could do something for the team, but to do it in such a difficult situation was a special contribution.\" His captain praised the resilience of his colleague: \"It is only a great player who can endure the pressures of a crisis and come back stronger. \" On the second of five days of play, the score was 413-8, a deficit of 116, but a series of miracles and resurrections had given hope that South Africa could win. The bowlers of England, who had been so threatening at the start of the South African innings, were thrown off the hook by the end of the day, when even the second new ball could not distract the batting.",

        " A major drugs seizure has been made in Ireland in a joint operation between the Garda Siochana and Irish Customs. This represents one of the largest seizures of suspected doping agents in the country's history. Officials believe that the agents were intended for both domestic distribution and perhaps for resale to other European countries. The value of the substances seized is estimated at millions of Euros. Attempts are being made to identify those responsible for the importation and planned distribution of the seized substances. Anabolic steroids are controlled substances in Ireland, and if they are used inadvertently for bodybuilding or sports, serious penalties apply. The steroid compounds are used to increase the strength and performance of some athletes, but with significant health risks such as liver damage, heart disease and hormone imbalances.",

The mountainous terrain and the poor weather hampered the search and rescue. The plane was at an altitude of about 11,000 feet. A plane with a crew and several passengers was reported to have left Adana on its way to Gaziantep when it disappeared. The search was by ground and by air. Turkish Air Force helicopters with night vision equipment began to search the rugged landscape, while special mountain rescue groups began to climb the steep slopes of the Amanos Mountains. Known for its difficult terrain and its changeable weather, the Amanos Mountains have already seen some accidents. The central command for the search was set up in Osmaniye.

        " At the age of 36 he has already established himself as a valuable member of Michael O’Neill’s coaching staff. Having formerly acted as assistant manager at St Mirren and Cowdenbeath, the former aide-de-camp to the Northern Ireland manager has done a great deal to help the five-times runners-up to the European Championship. The tactics he employs and his ability to get on with the players have been important in this unexpected qualification. “We wouldn’t have got where we are without him,” O’Neill said at a recent press conference, “without his understanding of the game and his ability to get on with the players.” In the dressing-room the players have also paid tribute to the way he simplifies complex tactical concepts and goes into the smallest detail. “We are not going to France just to make up the numbers,” the assistant manager told the press on Tuesday. “We’ve come this far and we’re not going there just to make up the numbers.” And now, with preparations for the finals under way, the challenge is to show that they can compete with the best of the rest of Europe. “We have earned our place and we’re going to do our best to leave our mark on the competition.”",

        " On Saturday, handball enthusiasts were back on the same floor where international handball was played twelve months ago. “It’s special to play on these tiles,” said Mira Patel, captain of the East London Handball Club. The Olympic arena, which was covered with copper, is now a vibrant local sports center and the promised lasting value of the Olympic legacy. Local schools, associations and sports clubs are now sharing the space with world-class athletes, which was designed for the Olympic Games. “It almost seems that the Olympic energy is still here,” said Patel. The transition has not been easy. “This is exactly what the Olympic legacy should be,” said the center's manager, David Richards, “not just the spectacular construction of facilities for a few weeks of competition, but the lasting structure that will benefit local communities for years.” The most difficult task has been to reduce the costs of operating the building and to maintain world-class quality for everyday use. But the first year has exceeded expectations and over three thousand local residents have become members.",
        " Chris Silverwood’s side, in fact, were beginning to look a little perilous. With five matches left to play, the first being against Somerset on Monday, they had a lead of 41 points, which placed them on the verge of a title, their first since 1919. A strong bowling attack and high scores at all levels of the order had laid the foundation for their success, as had captain James Thompson’s three centuries this season. Pace bowler Mark Richards was the top wicket-taker in the division with 47. “We’ve got to keep our eye on the ball against the opposition, as we always do, and it’s a good thing we did.” In the days ahead, Silverwood’s men had away matches against Hampshire and Yorkshire before concluding at home against Durham and Warwickshire. For their part, the opponents they were to face on Monday were in fourth place and would have liked a win that would have given them a mathematical chance of catching the leaders.",
        " Wales took the game to Ireland, dominated the first thirteen minutes and increased the advantage every moment, taking the opportunity of the mistakes of the Irish and going over them at a ruthless pace. Although Ireland made several strong attempts at a comeback, the match was never in their hands, and in the end, they lost a 43-20 match. The game at the Principality was a demonstration of the gap between the two countries, where Wales played according to their plan, while Ireland lacked the rhythm and the consistency of its play. Ireland's coaching staff will have to think hard about a lack of defense and a bad start before their next game. But the performance of Wales against a traditionally strong Ireland was very successful and gives them great confidence.",
        " Recent months have been erratic; the brilliant work of Pep Guardiola’s team has been lost, and they have been unable to retain the form which, when they were first at the top, brought them the title. Wednesday’s defeat at Stamford Bridge revealed flaws in the defensive organization of the Blues, which were exploited by the then ‘Samurai’ Conte, who was victorious on a night when his tactics were about as successful as their opening play. Now, in their first season in England, Pep Guardiola’s City has fallen to fourth place in the table, and the hopes of a league title are all but extinguished. In the aftermath of the game, Guardiola conceded the dismay that had set in, but remained philosophical about the process of building a team that would be able to compete at the very top of English football. ‘We must learn from these moments,’ he said. ‘It takes time to build a team that can compete at the very top.’ Keeping their place in the Champions League places will be the main goal, and with a reshuffle in the ranks, as well as a determined drive to finish in the top four, the race is on for a place. ‘We have played some very good football this season, but we must now make it more consistent,’ he said. Guardiola has hinted that there will be changes in the squad this summer, with defensive reinforcements being one possibility, and a look ahead to the coming season.",
        " ”We’ve always been very clear about our vision for Wales,” said Andrew RT Davies. Asked if his party merely opposes Labour policies, he insisted that they have comprehensive alternative plans. ”Our policy for the health service in Wales is to reduce waiting times and increase frontline services.” He also outlined the Conservative’s proposals for education and economic growth. ”We are not just pointing out the deficiencies in Labour’s record, but offering real alternatives to the people of Wales.” On being pressed by AM Jonathan Edwards on the details of policy, he pointed to the party’s manifesto and to statements they have made in the Assembly. ”People in Wales deserve to know that there is a different way forward,” he said. ”We are committed to delivering that alternative, not just criticising from the sidelines.”",
        " Dumbarton did not appear to be equal to such a blow, and Dunfermline continued to do all the play and have all the chances. After eleven minutes, the home side were two up. Then, with an unprovoked attack, the score was put back in the 37th minute, by a well-timed shot, swept into the far corner of the net. A minute later, the break came, and in the meanwhile the travellers gradually grew bolder, and in the 38th minute, the goal was again scored against the run of play. The second half began with a keenness of contest, and as the match entered the last quarter of an hour, the tension increased, and some roughness took place, as the battle for control was waged on both sides. Dunfermline's manager, Allan Johnston, had made it a rule to give his team more effort during the interval, and not to let the game go too much to their disadvantage.",
        " “When I arrived in Paris I was hale and hearty,” says Clotilde Nonnez, a yoga teacher who is now fifty-six. She is conscious of a decline in her health, and attributes it to the increase in air pollution, which has caused her chronic bronchitis and asthma attacks. So grave is her condition that in 2017 she lodged a lawsuit against the French State for failing to protect the population from the effects of air pollution. This was the first case of individual liability for a health problem resulting from air pollution. “It’s been a long time since I’ve had a cough, a breathing difficulty, an unexplained exhaustion that becomes unbearable on days when the air is very polluted.” Paris, despite the introduction of measures such as free days for cars and low-emission zones, continues to have serious air-quality problems, which, for people like Nonnez, affect their long-term health. Medical studies confirm the association between urban pollution and respiratory disorders.",
        " The moon was shining on the ruins, and the moonlight through the trees was falling on the overgrown garden. When we arrived, it was still and quiet, and the only sound was the soft crunching of the gravel as we walked up the winding path to the old house. We stopped at the iron gate, which creaked on the hinges when I opened it. The house was silhouetted against the dark sky, with its windows dark but for a faint light shining from an upstairs room. A cool breeze stirred the leaves of the trees, with a faint smell of rain and a distant smell of smoke. “Are you sure?” Martha whispered, her voice hardly audible in the silence. Martha’s fingers squeezed my arm as we stepped across the threshold. It was midnight. I had read the letter and knew that midnight was the time. It was to be at the north wing. But we had arrived together.",
        " In a surprise announcement, the Minister of Education said that Greece would prefer to proceed with diplomatic and political means, rather than to attempt to litigate or to take direct action. This represents a fundamental change of tactic for Greece, which has for a long time been asking for the return of the Elgin sculptural group, which is now in the British Museum. The Minister of Education, giving a press conference in Athens, said that, “we believe that the monuments of culture are not a matter for law, but that mutual respect and the universal co-operation are necessary for their conservation. We are not abandoning our claim, but we now believe that sustainable solutions will only be reached through dialogue and international co-operation.” This approach follows years of litigation and pressure from Greece’s parliament and the public, without success. As the world’s views on the repatriation of cultural property change, there is a growing expectation that this diplomatic turn could lead to an eventual settlement. The British Museum insists that the Elgin sculptural group was acquired legally, while Greece claims that it is an integral part of its cultural heritage, and that it should be reunited with the other sculptures of the Parthenon in Athens.",

The hospitals are overcrowded with dozens of injured, most of whom have suffered a broken leg or a broken rib. There is a lack of blood, which is why they are calling for donations. Meanwhile, weather forecasters warn of the risk of new landslides during the rainy season. The government is providing temporary accommodation in schools for hundreds of people who have been displaced. Relief organizations are providing food, drinking water and other necessities.

        " For one in ten new mothers, the postpartum period can be a time of unexpected emotional difficulties. One in ten women, in fact, suffer from postpartum depression, a serious condition that goes beyond the usual \"baby blues\". What is it? PPD is a state of severe depression which, unlike the baby blues, which usually disappear after a fortnight, can last months, if not properly treated. Unlike the baby blues, which disappear within two weeks, PPD can occur at any time within the first year after childbirth. PPD is a treatable condition, requiring a combination of therapies, medication, support groups and lifestyle changes. Many women suffer in silence because of shame and fear of judgment. By breaking the taboo around mother's mental health, we can help mothers suffering from this illness receive the help they need during this vulnerable time. Early treatment is the best way to recover and regain a good mother-child relationship.",
        " The suspension followed a formal investigation into Mr. Price’s conduct as a councillor, and the Council’s Disciplinary Committee decided that he had breached the council’s Code of Conduct. In November he was suspended from all council duties for five months after the Council’s Disciplinary Committee ruled that he had breached the code. When the decision was made, he was suspended from all council responsibilities, including committee meetings, council sessions and official representation of the council’s constituents for a period of five months. The breaches were said to relate to his behaviour during council sessions and his relations with council staff and fellow councillors. During the hearing it was claimed that he had failed to treat others with respect and consideration, and that his behaviour had brought his office and the authority into disrepute. The Council issued a statement saying that it was only following a careful consideration of the evidence that such a decision could be made, and that such action was necessary in order to maintain the public’s confidence in local authorities.",
        " Without additional context or a document to refer to, I can only give general information. Jeh Johnson was Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security under President Obama from 2013 to 2017. I have no additional information on the Secretary of State’s reaction to the Paris attacks, apart from what you have stated. For further information on the Secretary’s reaction to the Paris attacks, I recommend that you check with the Department of Homeland Security’s archive, with reliable news sources and public statements by the Department during that period. In the wake of major terrorist incidents such as the Paris attacks, the Department of Homeland Security will intensify cooperation with international partners, increase security measures and maintain continuous contact with all relevant agencies.",
        " The fragment you sent me appears to be a description of Mr. Roach, who won 56 of something, or some votes or whatever, when he was secretary of the Union of the Region of Yorkshire. Without further information I am unable to proceed. Nevertheless, I would be happy to help you with anything you might need, were you to let me know in greater detail what it is you want.",
        " The motion was moved by Deputy Jim O’Callaghan, Fianna Fáil, and he spoke of the potential for public disorder, should the march take place, citing intelligence reports and past riots at such demonstrations. There was fear, he said, that the march would end in violence. On the government side, it was agreed to examine the motion and consult with the Garda before taking a final decision on the security arrangements. He stressed that while he supported the right to peaceful protest, public safety had to be the priority. The proposal sparked a debate among Deputy O’Callaghan’s colleagues, with some supporting the motion and others voicing concern that any restrictions might infringe the constitutional right to peaceable assembly.",
        " There are many reasons for this sudden turn of fortune, but Coach Joe has identified a few: The absence of long-term defensive stalwarts, David Williams and Archangel Rodriguez, who were so reliable during the initial period of the season. During the first months of the season, they won six of their first seven matches, but the recent play is completely different from the way they started: six victories in the first seven games. The high degree of quality is still there, but the sharpness that made us difficult to beat is missing. We have to get that back again, we need to play like in the beginning. The heavy schedule has also taken its toll, with some players showing fatigue during recent matches. The team captain, Alphonso Martinez, is calling for unanimity during this difficult period. “Every team has periods of difficulty,” he said. The next few games will be key to their season, playing several top opponents. The true character of the team will be seen in the coming weeks. It's all about how we react.",
        " Uefa disciplinary department punished the both teams for violence against the referees during the game between these two teams. The punishment was imposed on the two teams for a collision between the players and the referee during a game between the two teams. This incident continues the ongoing discussion about the conduct of players and the protection of referees in European football competitions. The club has three days to challenge the decision, but Uefa representatives have indicated that the disciplinary commission's review of the evidence was \"clear and unambiguous.\" Uefa firmly rejects such conduct and insists that respect for match officials is a basic principle of fair play.",
        " If you wish to argue a historical event where IS claimed to be the perpetrator, I would need to know which incident you are talking about. I must emphasise that I cannot and will not continue to ascribe terrorist attacks to particular groups without full context. Such assertions without reference to which attacks, to when they occurred and to independent confirmation would be irresponsible. Could you tell me which specific incident or which period of time you are interested in? I can then provide you with a factual, balanced account of a confirmed historical event, based on reliable reporting.",
        " The site in question is a rubbish dump in Alamogordo, New Mexico, where the excavations uncovered a large number of copies of the infamous Atari game ‘E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial’. The discovery has become an iconic moment in gaming history, marking the physical proof of one of the most notorious failures in gaming history and the collapse of the gaming market after it. The game, released in 1982 for the Atari 2600 console, was developed in just five weeks in order to cash in on the success of the film of the same name by Steven Spielberg. It went straight into the bargain bin, resulting in Atari’s bankruptcy, and its creators were subsequently forced to take the risk of dumping unsold copies of the game into the wilderness.",
        " Laces have the next season as the top of the line midfielder. Last year, in the play-off final against Wycombe, he was the equalizer, and Wembley was sent to penalties, where Southend won by a score of 7 to 6 and got into League One. Laces, who is only 22, was with Southend all season. “I’ll never forget that moment at Wembley,” he said to the club’s website, “and to score such an important goal for the club I’ve supported since childhood was something I’d never thought of before.” His form was seen by a few League One teams, who regularly had scouts present at Southend matches. “We have every confidence in him and we’re delighted to have him help us on our way,” said coach Kevin Maher.",
        " Scott Kashket has been added to the roster until the end of the month. The striker scored once in twenty-two matches for the O's, and hopes to make a greater impression on the other side. 'Scott will be an alternative in attack,' the coach says, 'he's a mobile player who can operate in narrow spaces.'He is a hard worker and a chance-maker in the final third. The striker has been at Wycombe and Crewe before joining Orient. If the registration is completed in time, he could play this weekend against ***. We are pleased to have him with us until the end of the year.'",
        " These nightly tube trains will be running from Friday to Sunday on the Central and Victoria lines, with the aim of eventually extending it to the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines. With more than 100 British Transport Police officers on duty at the 144 stations, to set an example of behavior, the London transport authorities are hoping to launch the new, all-night tube service. One million people are expected to use the nightly service every weekend, which will stimulate the nightlife economy and also reduce the journey time for many shift workers. London mayor Sadiq Khan says the city's economy will be boosted by £77 million a year, and that about two thousand jobs will be created. Previously, however, the project had been held up by disputes with the transport workers' unions over working and payment conditions.",
        " Russia is the first country in which, as an official public broadcaster, there has been no mention of the war in Ukraine. By contrast, almost all Western governments, international organizations and independent monitors have acknowledged that Russia is involved in the conflict in Ukraine, both in the Crimea and in the east, since the beginning of the year 2014. This gives a different meaning to the word war in Ukraine than most international observers give. The Ukrainian government is portrayed as the aggressor and the armed pro-Russian groups as the resistance. The news about the wars is shaped by the interests of the state and may be selectively chosen. Many international organizations have seen Russian actions as a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. I recommend that you use several sources with different perspectives. I recommend that you consult with independent journalists on the spot, with international monitoring organizations and with a few selected other sources. Interpreting the different stories about the wars will help you get a more complete picture of the complex geopolitical situations. Be aware of how words and images can shape your perception.",
        " One of the most important debates in the United Kingdom is Gatwick’s proposed second runway. Gatwick claims that it will: — Increase its annual capacity by an extra 30 million passengers — Create thousands of new jobs — Present a less expensive and more environmentally friendly alternative to Heathrow’s expansion — Present fewer legal and other obstacles to a speedy and relatively inexpensive solution — Provide economic benefits to the wider south-east of England beyond London — The Plan Gatwick claims that it will cost considerably less than Heathrow’s plan, will affect fewer residential areas, will create fewer noise problems, and will provide a better and more economically advantageous solution to the transport and aviation crisis that Britain is now facing. The local population, the air-transport industry, and the various conservation groups are still divided over which plan would best serve the country’s long-term interests and the environment.",
        " Here in North and Mid Wales, a year ago, heavy rains had overloaded the drainage systems, in some places the flooding was so severe that a woman lost her life. Especially in Gwynedd, Conwy, Denbighshire and Powys, flooding had wreaked havoc. Roads had been closed, railways were interrupted and bridges destroyed. Hundreds of homes had been flooded, hundreds of people were evacuated. The emergency services had conducted extensive rescue operations, and had been helped by the RAF and the Mountain Rescue Service in more remote areas. The Welsh Government had pledged to review flood-control strategies and provide extra funding for affected communities. There were concerns that flood defences were inadequate, and questions were asked about the influence of climate change on the frequency of extreme weather events in Wales. Some communities were cut off, and supplies had to be flown in by air. Since then, the local authorities and the environment agency have worked together to improve warning systems and strengthen flood defences in vulnerable areas.",
        " The police were called, and arrived at about 0:50 a.m. According to witnesses, the quarrel, which began in the shop, turned into a street fight. One person received slight injuries and was treated at the scene by paramedics. The police have examined the security cameras in the restaurant and the surrounding shops to determine the cause of the disturbance. The police intervened to separate the participants and took statements from a number of witnesses. The police would like to hear from anyone with information about the incident.",
        " “The riot police had taken over the interior of the Trafford Centre in an attempt to simulate a terrorist attack. However, many local residents and advocacy groups complained that this was a deeply offensive, stigmatizing and stereotypical exercise, and the link between Islam and terrorism. In May 2016, the Greater Manchester Police apologised for a training exercise in which an actor played a suicide bomber and shouted Allahu Akbar before exploding a fake bomb. The incident sparked a broader discussion about the importance of avoiding religious stereotyping in security training, while preparing effectively for potential threats. The Assistant Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police, Garry Shewan, acknowledged these concerns in a statement saying: “On reflection, it was unacceptable to use the religious expression Allahu Akbar immediately before a mock suicide bombing, which so explicitly connected the exercise with Islam. We regret any offence this may have caused.” Incidents such as these, as well as a number of reports, have led to many police forces reviewing their training practices to ensure that they do not reinforce prejudices against any group.",
        " Norwegian ice experts have reported that sea ice is becoming thinner and more vulnerable. The ice is thinner and therefore more prone to melting, and the water under it is darker and absorbs more radiation, thus warming the sea even more and further increasing the rate of ice melt. Using a combination of satellite and underwater measurements, together with direct observations in the field, the Norwegian Polar Institute has provided some of the most complete data on the state of the sea ice. The scientists are particularly concerned about the following consequences of this increased vulnerability: Faster melting during the summer months. Less room for polar bears and seals. New shipping routes with the risk of increased pollution. Changes in the global ocean circulation and the way of life of coastal populations that are dependent on the ice.",
        " The rivalry between the two Mercedes drivers has grown increasingly fierce as they became the undisputed favorites of the season. After his early retirement in Melbourne, he was able to prove his superiority by winning in Malaysia, in Bahrain and in China, and this great success enabled him to leapfrog his teammate in the ranking despite his victory in the first race of the year. It is therefore an interesting battle that is to take place within the team, between two drivers of equal excellence, on the technical Barcelona circuit. It will be to see if Lewis will be able to continue his series of victories, or if Rosberg will find an answer to be able to take the lead again. The teams in the shadow of the two Mercedes have no more to offer than to take up the chase and it is not yet known if the next races will be enough for the other teams to regain the advantage, and it is quite possible that the first of the year will have been lost to Rosberg.",
        " After months of surveillance, a multiagency operation ended in a raid on several residences in the south and the middle of England on September 30, 2014. Police made eight arrests, as part of a criminal investigation into an organised crime group. A large number of suspects were held in custody and released on bail, and the investigation was continued. It showed the extent of ongoing work to disrupt criminal networks that operated across regions. The suspects were taken into custody for questioning on suspicion of various offences, presumably including drugs, money laundering, fraud, etc., but the precise charges were not revealed pending the initiation of the legal proceedings.",
        " In the second half the hosts, especially on the right flank, with the dangerous Daniel Candeias, became very active. After a Morelos goal, which was cancelled out, and a Bruno Alves shot from close in, they could only show their frustration. The visitors defended well, kept a compact shape, and allowed nothing more than a few shots. The decisive moment came in the 73rd minute, when Rangers were awarded a penalty for a foul on Josh Windass in the penalty area. James Tavernier, with a resolute kick, placed the ball in the corner, finally breaking the deadlock. The Portuguese winger fired in a number of dangerous crosses, but the visiting goalkeeper made a series of brilliant saves to preserve his clean sheet. In the end, despite a few nerve-wracking moments in the time added on, the hosts held out for a deserved victory. The visitors pushed forward in the closing stages, leaving their backs exposed to Rangers’ attempts to hit them on the break.",
        " Cyber Monday is the first Monday after the Black Friday weekend and has traditionally been the busiest day of the year for shopping online. Almost £1 billion is expected to be spent on the day, which is almost 33 per cent higher than last year, according to the IMRG analysts. \"This significant increase reflects the increasing trend towards digital shopping and the confidence consumers have in their digital retail experiences,\" says an Experian-IMRG representative. \"And many are also shopping early because of the concerns about delivery during the busy season.\" Many companies have extended their Black Friday promotions over the weekend and on Monday in order to get consumers' money. Retail experts have warned consumers that there are fewer bargains to be had than they might think on this day and that it is important to check the prices before buying. Expected to be popular this year are electrical appliances, fashion, toys and household items. The share of mobile shopping is also expected to increase significantly over previous years.",
        " From WADA's revelations that Russia was conducting a systematic, state-run doping programme, the scandal burst into the open. Russia's exclusion from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in 2015 was the greatest doping scandal in the history of sport. The IAAF ban on Russian athletes was extended for a second year in 2017 and meant that the Russian team was not allowed to compete in the IAAF World Championships in London that year. And while the ban on Russia continued beyond that date, the IAAF created a system whereby individual Russian athletes could compete under the designation of 'neutral' if they could prove that they had been trained outside the Russian system and had been subjected to thorough doping controls. This involved allegations of sample-tampering, doping-cover-ups and widespread doping in many sports, with athletics in particular. A case was opened under the laws of criminal procedure against Russian athletes at the European Court of Justice in The Hague.",

        " He said he was a great loss to the team, because of his experience and quality. Arteta said that the defender, who is 31, has been out since the 6-0 defeat of Ludogorets on October 15, has had the operation successfully and will start his rehabilitation next week. Ben White and Takehiro Tomiyasu will have to fill in in defence, and Arteta said he would need a full squad to get through this difficult period. “The doctors think it will be about four months, but we will take it step by step. That is why we have a strong and flexible squad.” “We have players who are ready to play their part,” added Arteta.",
        " An immense political commotion resulted from the incident, which was seen by many as a sign of contempt or snobbery towards the voters. The apology was for posting on social media a picture of a semi-detached house with three English flags on it and a white van parked in front of it. The post was criticized for making fun of or stereotyping voters who display English flags. The picture of English flags and a white van had become a contentious image in class and national identity debates in the UK. The case highlighted tensions between social classes in British politics and sparked a discussion about how the politicians see and relate to different sections of the electorate. The shadow attorney general acknowledged that the post had been wrong and apologized, saying that the intention had not been to mock or scorn anyone.",
        " Your reference to the controversy in Luton in September 2016 when the Luton city councillor Aysegul Gurbuz was temporarily suspended for tweeting about Hitler and the 'Holocaust,' which are, as you say, very offensive, historically unfounded and hate-speech. I apologize, but I don't think I can continue or expand this. If you are interested in historical events, the dangers of extremist ideologies, the issue of combating hate speech, I would be happy to have a discussion with you on this. Hitler is responsible for the Holocaust and the death of millions. I cannot and will not praise, defend or expand on anti-Semitic views or praise Hitler.",
        " After his first appearance on the small screen, Chris Hardman, professionally known as “Little Chris,” secured a contract with a record company and released his first single “Check It Out,” which reached number three on the British charts. He had gained popularity at the age of fifteen when he was chosen for a reality show, “Rock School,” in which Kiss frontman Gene Simmons taught and coached a group of pupils at Kirkley Grammar School in Lowestoft, and among them was Little Chris. He was marked as one of the most promising with his musical talent and ebullient personality. In the wake of his success, Hardman continued to work in the entertainment industry, appearing in various television shows, continuing to make music, and also appearing in the West End musical “Loserville.” He also released an album with the same title, “Little Chris,” and starred in his own TV series, “Everybody Loves Little Chris” on Channel 4. After his death, there was a general discussion about depression, since he had talked about his depression in the past. It was in March 2015 that he died at the age of twenty-four.",
        " This is a real news story about a missing child. I don’t have any information about Kelly Mahon or this case beyond what you have told me. I can’t make up details or speak of an ongoing trial or investigation. Is there anything else I can help you with today? If you are asking me to create a fictional story that continues the plot line, I have to refuse because it would be in bad taste to create a fictional story about a missing child or someone who has been arrested.",
        " “I am delighted to extend my stay at the club,” he said after signing the new contract. The veteran centre-half has played over 150 games in all competitions for the club since his arrival in the summer of 2013. A strong presence on and off the field, he has become an example to the younger players, a good coach and a dependable performer. The coach was happy to have secured the player’s services for the next few years: “He is a great player with experience, quality and the necessary know-how, which reflects the values of this club and also speaks of our ambitions. This club has become my home over the last few years and I am very happy to be able to continue being a part of our team.” The contract extension was announced just as the team is preparing for a new season.",
        " The constant financial constraints are, according to headmasters and teaching unions, making it more and more difficult to recruit and retain teachers, especially in subjects where the supply of staff is lacking. The National Education Union says that since 2010 teachers' pay has fallen by almost a quarter in real terms, which has prompted many experienced teachers to leave the profession. It is the governments's policy of limiting the raise of teachers and of reducing school budgets to \"real\" level that, according to them, is lowering the level of teaching standards. \"Schools all over the country have been forced to make difficult choices, because it is no longer possible to pay the market rate for teachers,\" said one secondary school principal, who preferred to remain anonymous. Schools also have to make hard choices, in order to keep their budgets balanced, about reducing staff, narrowing the curriculum and increasing class size. Various studies conclude that without changes to the policy of the government on budgets and pay, educational standards will fall and the gap between the disadvantaged and the others will widen. The government is already talking about spending the highest amount of money ever on schools, in cash terms, with two billion pounds more being earmarked for each of the next two years.",
        " The question which has been a long standing dispute between the crofters and the Crofting Commission, was in relation to the distribution of common grazings money. The Crofting Commission formally apologises for the way it had dealt with the matter of the grazings committees. They admit in their statement that they have misinterpreted some of the crofting law and that they have acted in a way which was not in keeping with the spirit of that law. They vowed to work more closely in future with the crofters and to improve the procedures for consultation. Several common grazings committees, particularly in the Western Isles, had been removed from office, and this had caused much disturbance in these farming communities. The Scottish Government, which is responsible for the Crofting Commission, said that it would monitor the situation closely, as part of its commitment to help maintain sustainable crofting in the Highlands and Islands. The crofters have welcomed the statement, but some are demanding more in the way of concrete measures to restore trust.",
        " This ruling allows Kansai Electric Power Company to start up the two idled units of the Takahama power station which had been closed down under the nationwide halt to all operations. The court ruled that the Takahama unit met the new, more stringent safety standards, which had been imposed by the Nuclear Regulation Authority after the Fukushima accident. In order to start up, the power station will have to complete a series of final safety checks and get local government approval to start operating. The ruling is part of a gradual return to nuclear energy in Japan, where the rising cost of fossil fuels has made them more attractive in terms of both economics and the environment.",

Having heard the representations of both parties, and having viewed the film, the Committee was not satisfied that an error had occurred. The appeal of the club Glentoran on the decision made during their game against Cliftonville is therefore dismissed. The result of the game and any disciplinary action taken against the players involved shall stand. The original decision of the referee in this matter was, it was decided, correct according to the law of the game, and there had been no clear and obvious error. The club Glentoran is entitled to appeal this decision within seven days in accordance with the rules of the Irish FA. The Committee wish to thank all parties for their co-operation.”",

        " Felex Barrow, a boy of six from Swanmore, near Southampton, is recovering well from the severe injuries he received when he was knocked down outside his home. His head was cut open, his bones were broken and he was unconscious for three weeks. During the three weeks of his unconsciousness, his parents kept a vigil at his bedside. His family are deeply grateful to the medical and rescue services and to the local community for the help they have given them. Felix, despite the severity of his injuries, has shown remarkable courage throughout his ordeal. When he awoke from his unconsciousness, he began the arduous ordeal of rehabilitation, and spent many hours with physiotherapists and other experts to regain his strength and mobility. His rehabilitation continues and he is gradually resuming his normal activities. His convalescence will continue for some time. The accident has led to a rethink on road safety measures in residential areas, and the local authorities are reviewing what measures can be taken to prevent similar accidents in future.",
        " ‘I’m shocked,’ she said as she crossed the line. ‘I’m only forty and I’m the mother of a baby girl, but I’m still here.’ In a remarkable display of stamina and tactical acumen, the 40-year-old stayed with the leading pack right to the finish, before making her move in the final straight. She now follows in her friend and former training partner Paula Radcliffe’s footsteps as the European champion. ‘Just think, I was pregnant just twelve months ago, and now I’m European champion.’ Her victory will inspire mothers who compete as athletes, and show that age is no barrier to success at the very top. Pavey now plans to compete in next year’s World Championships, having reaffirmed her belief that she can compete against the best in the world. The success was attributed to her meticulous preparation and tactical genius.",
        " Ireland, in the face of this new development, was in a strong position. Mr. Adams had been in Portadown on business, but before the conclusion of the discussion, he referred to a certain statement made by the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, on the question of a possible Irish unity. A united Ireland, he said, would be the best solution to the economic and political difficulties which the Brexit would bring about on the island of Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement already contained a provision for a national unity vote, if it was shown that there was a majority of support for this idea in Northern Ireland. It was necessary to revive this consideration, he said, if the opinion of the people of the province, following the vote of the United Kingdom, was to be favourable to this idea.",
        " A major boost to the club’s hopes is the news that the 30-year-old Irishman, the veteran playmaker Quinn, is ready for Sunday’s crunch Scottish League Cup semi-final against Celtic. The veteran was left out of last week’s league match with Celtic after a hamstring strain, but yesterday he successfully trained with the first team, thereby putting any lingering doubts to rest. Manager McIntosh was glad to have his services again. The match kicks off at 3 p.m. at Hampden and the winner will play either Rangers or Aberdeen, who face off in the other semi-final tomorrow, at Ibrox. ‘Quinn has the experience to bring composure to a game like this,’ he said. ‘We can count on him for inspiration and leadership. It’s a bonus to have him available in the middle against a good Celtic side.’ On three previous occasions, in the Scottish Cup, Quinn has scored against Celtic, so he is a man to watch in Sunday’s game. He may well add to his tally, as he looks to lead the side into a first Scottish Cup final for four years.",
        " The film-maker Steve Pemberton, who has worked on the series ‘The League of Gentlemen’ and ‘Inside No. 9’, has now secured the rights to E. F. Benson’s ‘Mapp and Lucia’ novels, which chronicle the delightfully pettish social rivalry between Elizabeth Mapp and Emmeline ‘Lucia’ Lucas, in the fictitious seaside town of Tilling, based on Rye in East Sussex. The books, which Benson wrote between 1920 and 1939, have already been adapted for television, including a BBC production in 2014, which starred Miranda Richardson and Anna Chancellor. Pemberton’s background in black comedy and period dramas, which he brought to ‘The League of Gentlemen’ and ‘Inside No. 9’, bodes well for his ability to capture the humour and the sly social satire of Benson’s work. All production and release dates are as yet undisclosed.",
        " The sudden demonetization decision of the government has led to chaos all over the country, and people are scrambling to change the invalidated currency. Banks and ATMs have been engulfed by a huge rush of people, who rushed to banks to deposit their old notes or withdraw new currency. Four days after the launch of the government's anti-corruption program, people still stand in long queues outside ATMs. Many have been turned off for days because they have not been able to be re-calibrated to dispense the new currency. Small businessmen and laborers have been severely affected, as they are unable to make their purchases without cash. Those who are still working have run out of cash and have to wait in line for long hours. The government has maintained that this is just a temporary inconvenience that has long-term benefits for the country, and that people should be patient and use digital money as much as possible during this transitional period. There is a serious decline in the market, as many merchants cannot provide change for invalidated notes. Many opposition parties are criticizing the government's sudden demonetization decision as unprepared and unpopular, and they are calling for the immediate withdrawal of the new currency.",
        " The peace befits those who die in their sleep. President Obama has vetoed the act allowing the families of the three thousand victims of the attacks of September 11, to sue the king of Arabia. The measure, known as the Justice Against the Sponsors of Terrorism Act, was passed by both houses with great bipartisan support. The bill would have modified the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and allowed the victims of a terrorist attack on American soil to sue foreign states alleged to be responsible for it. It is not specifically the case of Arabia, but the country has been the focus of a large number of investigations, without, however, confirming the official deniability of its links to the September 11 attacks. This would have been the first time that Congress had overridden one of the vetoes of President Obama. Moreover, the bill's critics, including the Obama administration, feared diplomatic and commercial repercussions, as well as retaliatory laws in other countries that could compromise the interests of the United States.",
        " The police reported that the driver, a 27-year-old man, was charged with carrying a prohibited load. A sofa was balanced on the trunk of a small sports car and only tied with a thin rope. The policemen immediately stopped the car for obvious reasons. The sofa could have fallen on the road and caused a serious accident, said Sergeant Emma Collins, police spokeswoman. The police used this case to draw attention to the importance of properly securing the transport of objects and to think about using appropriate vehicles for large items. The police said that the driver said he was moving house and wanted to save a trip. He is therefore threatened with a fine and possibly points on his license.",
        " The company was said to have gone live in a hundred and thirty countries. This expansion of the service would represent a major milestone in its expansion. In the statement the head of the company pointed out that the platform had been adapted to accommodate local requirements and that the local languages had been translated and payment systems adapted to the local preferences. The firm said that its growth had been helped by strategic alliances with local telecommunications companies and regulatory approvals that it had secured over the past eighteen months. It was a tremendous thing. In the market the share rose 7%. The firm’s expansion was expected to result in substantial revenue growth in the coming financial year.",

During her treatment blood transfusions helped her body fight against the disease. Orla’s story is just one of many in which the giving of blood has saved lives.

        " The United States has consistently urged Pakistan to act against terrorist groups, especially those which threaten the stability of the region and those that have been involved in terrorist acts against American interests and allies. In their view, Pakistan should act against all militant groups, including those that might have had contacts with some parts of the security apparatus. The State Department, it has been reported, urged the country to act against all militant groups operating within its borders. But this relationship has evolved over the years.

        " The Dow Jones index had risen 0.3% on Thursday, the S&P 500 gained 0.5%, while the Nasdaq had risen 0.7%. It had risen because of the hope that February's employment data, which was expected to be very good, would show that the labor market was still going strong despite the long-standing concern about inflation. The yield on the ten-year note had risen to 4.1% on anticipation of the data, the dollar also rose against the major currencies in anticipation of the data. What had been of particular concern was the impending report on the February employment situation. The 200,000 jobs that economists were predicting would be created would show a very strong upswing. The Fed has maintained that it wants to see clear signs of moderation in the economy before it cuts interest rates. And the employment report is especially important for expectations of future monetary policy.",

It is estimated that about 400 people in the province of Ulster live with permanent disabilities resulting from gunshot and bomb injuries during the years of the troubles. They form a unique category of survivors, whose lives have been forever changed by the violence that has afflicted the province for so long.",
        " WHEN the British Government made a new and separate treaty with Great Britain, so as to annex the West Indies to the British Dominions, it was foreseen that there would be a series of reciprocal treaties with the American republics, which were soon to be brought under the same tariff as treaties of alliance with the rest of the world. The First Minister, the great result of the negotiations, was a statement of his intention to study the question of making payments for treatment to all who, being citizens of a country, not having a reciprocal treaty with Great Britain, would find it more difficult to obtain a charge for the medical attention of such persons. It was stated that the Welsh Government, in a discussion of the question, must, in the matter of its control of the expenditure of the National Health Service, try to make its budget and its obligations of humanity to all citizens of the world, and to maintain the free medical attention for all, regardless of nationality and residence. The fee for medical attention for such people was to be ascertained.",
        " As to the difficulty of the choice to be made, between the instantaneous removal of a few passengers and the safety of the rest, I shall not go into the question. What I can say is that it was a critical situation on board an aircraft, when the decision to evacuate was to be taken by the captain of the plane, which was about to fly. I do not have access to the BBC News report in question, so I cannot continue the story as told by the captain of the plane. But I can cite the serious responsibility that cabin crew members have during emergencies. Would you like me to explain in general terms the safety measures taken by cabin crews in the event of an emergency?",
        " The plan for a golf course and a large tennis and golf course and a hotel have been made by an interested party for the benefit of the green belt and the compass, the realisation of which has caused much debate and controversy. It is being reviewed by the local planning authority, and the various interest groups are giving their views on the potential impacts of the project. The planning process must consider many issues. Firstly, the impact on local habitats, on the species and on the character of the landscape. Secondly, the protection of the green belt, which restricts development to protect open countryside. Thirdly, the impact on traffic and transport and the demand for existing roads and the system. Fourthly, the consequences for health and social care. Fifthly, the balance between economic benefits and the protection of the environment. Lastly, the opinion of the local population, which has expressed both support and opposition. The public debate is probably already ongoing or will be scheduled to gather additional community views. The final decision will have to balance the needs of development, protection of the environment and the interests of the community.",

Instead of continuing with this narrative of a terrorist attack, I would like to suggest that, if you wish to discuss this historical event, we can have a respectful conversation about the impact of terrorism, how societies can recover from these disasters, and about the security measures that can be implemented afterwards. I do not think it is my place to prolong this narrative of a real terrorist attack. But would you be willing to engage in a more constructive discussion about the following aspects of this event?",
        " The defender, a key figure in the squad this season, has had a hip problem for a few weeks. It had been anticipated that he would miss Saturday's defeat at home to Aberdeen after consulting a specialist about the problem. But the team's medical staff got good news from the specialist who had decided that the injury was not as bad as it had first seemed. He reassured the club that it would not require surgery. The doctor said that with careful treatment he would be fit in two weeks. The team hope that he will be able to play against the opposition in two weeks time and his fitness will be assessed as he trains. The medical staff has come up with a training programme that is designed to strengthen the muscles around the hip and give him the best chance of a quicker return to the team.",
        " After many years of searching, the circumstances of the disappearance of Andrew Bedford, a young man of twenty-seven from Huntingdonshire, are still the subject of controversy. The case goes back to September of that year and his disappearance is still unsolved. Investigation: Initially, it was treated as a missing person case, but later it was switched to a murder investigation, codenamed ‘Operation Ongar’. Andrew was last seen eating a takeaway in a light blue Ford Cortina, in a boiler suit that suggested he might have been on his way to work or already there. During the subsequent investigation, new information was obtained and his disappearance was still listed among the oldest in the history of the Cambridgeshire police force, even after so many years. In 2015, the police announced a new investigation, resuming searches and calling for witnesses who might be able to provide information about the case. The family of Andrew continues to demand an answer. If you have information about Andrew Bedford’s disappearance, please contact the police or Crimestoppers anonymously.",
        " At present, Surrey has been warned of probable financial difficulties, owing to the reduction of its grants by central government. The Leader of Surrey County Council, D. Hodge, has announced the reduction of his Government's grants to the County of Surrey. The large size of the reduction of £170m. presupposes that this would have a considerable effect on the Council's operations and its delivery of services. These cuts are a part of the general system of austerity imposed by the Government on all the United Kingdom's counties, since the General Election of 1910, which has necessitated the taking of various measures in coping with them, such as the reduction of services, the drawing on reserves, the raising of taxes, and the reduction of administration. Such was the specific situation at the time, which has not been explained in the text.",

        " Germany's policy under Chancellor Angela Merkel was initially largely tolerant, based on the famous remark: \"Wir schaffen das\" (\"We can do this\"), and the influx represents one of the most severe challenges for the European Union in the history of the movement of people. Indeed, in the year under review, it has been the recipient of a large number of refugees: 450,000 already in the first quarter, with a forecast of 1 million for the end of the year, the highest in the European Union. But the large scale of migration has also caused a political and social crisis in Germany and the whole of the European Union, as well as discussions about the integration capacity, the division of resources and cultural differences. The country has mobilized a lot of resources for processing and for temporary accommodation, food and basic services. The rule of the first-entry state for asylum seekers, the so-called Dublin rule, has been particularly affected by the crisis. In the context of the crisis, discussions also arose on the subject of European asylum policy, the handling of Schengen borders and the sharing of responsibilities between the member states. Some German states and local communities claimed to be overloaded by the problem. Is there a particular aspect of the matter that you would like me to examine more closely?",

Transport Scotland will be holding public consultations on the plans for the crossing in the coming months. The scheme of improvement of the A9 will eventually involve the duplication of the whole 112 miles of the road between Inverness and Perth and the consequent reduction in travel times between Inverness and the Central Belt, an improvement in road safety on one of Scotland’s most dangerous roads, an economic boost for the Highlands and improved journey times for goods and passengers.",

        " The amendment, supported by rebel Tories and the opposition parties, calls for a parliamentary vote on the final deal before the UK leaves the European Union. This means that the amendment will be voted on instead of being negotiated away or withdrawn. This would put a significant check on the government's power to negotiate the Brexit deal. If the amendment is passed, the government will have to bring the final deal back to parliament, which could reject it or decide to renegotiate with the European Union. Supporters argue that this would give parliament a necessary oversight of the Brexit process. Critics say that it would undermine the government's negotiating position with the European Union. The government is expected to make last-minute concessions to avoid defeat. The result of the vote will probably be close, depending on how many Conservative MPs rebel.",
        " In the proximity of Stonehenge, in Wiltshire, stands the important mesolithic site of Blick Mead, and recent discoveries there point to a human occupation dating back to about 10,000 years, which would make it one of the most ancient sites in the United Kingdom. The excavation, led by archaeologist David Jacques, was made in October of last year, and recently carbon dating has confirmed the evidence of the presence of man there from about that period. Jacques and his team found in the excavation numerous objects, including flint tools, animal bones showing signs of butchery, and evidence of ancient feasting. The site contains a natural spring whose waters change the stones to a vivid pink colour, which was probably sacred to the ancient inhabitants. The carbon dating demonstrates that the settlement is thousands of years older than Stonehenge. Jacques points out that this would indicate that the area around Stonehenge was considered sacred for a much longer time than was previously thought, a finding which would change our understanding of the cultural context of this iconic prehistoric monument. Jacques thinks that this is an important discovery, as it links the mesolithic hunter-gatherers who first settled in the area with the later neolithic builders of Stonehenge, and could even shed light on why it was erected in its current location.",

Strachan’s job is under pressure following Scotland’s failure to qualify for the World Cup in Russia. Scotland came third in their qualifying group behind England and Slovakia and failed to qualify for the play-offs. ‘We think we’ve made progress with these players,’ he said. ‘There is a foundation to build on, whether it’s with Gordon or with somebody else.’ The Scottish FA is expected to make an announcement on Strachan’s future within the next few weeks.

        " The Front National’s affair had been exposed in a lower amount than the present amount, but when the investigation went on and more and more evidence was gathered, the figure grew substantially to the present figure of five and a half million. This increases the suspected embezzlement of European Parliamentary funds far more than had been supposed. This affair, which OLAF and the French authorities have been conducting for several years now, concerns not only Marine Le Pen, but other important figures in the party. It is one of the greatest cases of suspected misuse of European Parliamentary funds in the last few years. The investigations imply that the FN was using European Parliamentary funds intended for assistants to pay the salaries of persons who mainly worked for the French party, which is the misuse of European Parliamentary funds.",

        " The elections of Tunisia, whose citizens shook the foundations of the revolution, and which shook the throne of long-established tyrants of the country, mark a decisive stage in the life of the country, which, despite its difficult situation, has maintained a fragile transition towards democracy, unlike the other countries of the Arab spring. The elections this time take place in the country where the Arab spring originated, and it is to be a struggle between the former members of the cabinet, and the counter-revolutionary supporters. President Marzouki drew a line between those who championed the democratic reforms of the revolution, and those who came from the old establishment and who wanted to regain power by democratic means. The presence of former members of the cabinet has polarized the electoral situation. International observers will follow the process closely and will closely monitor the transparency of the election, in which, as before, the democratic experiment in Tunisia will be a test for the political transition in the region. Meanwhile, economic concerns, high unemployment, high inflation, and the material benefit of the revolution have not yet been felt.",
        " Heavy rains, storms, gales, high rivers, flooded Cumberland and Lancashire, the tidal waves rose higher than the Cumberland and Irish Seas, and a flood of the sea, rising over the Lune, the Derwent and the Eden, inundated tens of thousands of homes and properties. Various bridges were swept away and made unsafe. Military forces were called in to help with evacuation and reinforcements of flood barriers, which were overwhelmed by the flood. The civil defense service worked around the clock to evacuate people from the most affected areas, and many were rescued by boat from their flooded homes. The government declared a major incident and announced an emergency financial assistance to the most severely affected communities. Several main roads were impassable and train service was suspended across much of the north of England and Scotland. Power outages were widespread, and many properties were left without electricity, and some communities were cut off completely by the flooding. The weather scientists pointed out that these increasingly frequent extreme weather events showed that the climate change was already having an effect on the weather pattern in Britain. The work of reconstruction will probably last for months and the economic damage will be in the hundreds of millions of pounds.",

The Real Madrid forward scored a crucial goal in the 82nd minute to ensure a 1-0 victory in Nicosia and keep them at the head of the group. Wales were on top of the table at the beginning of the second half of the game. Rob Page praised his players' patience and character, in difficult conditions, with temperatures reaching 30 degrees in the evening. We knew it would be difficult, but the lads showed great character, he said. Wales, now have 13 points from five games and are still ahead of Belgium, with a two-point lead. Wales are now looking forward to the important game at home against Croatia, on Monday. A good result will put them in a good position to qualify directly for the finals. It is sometimes necessary to find the result in a qualifying campaign, and this was one of those times.",
        " “On the surface of the water” (it was completed in 1919, in the last decade of Monet’s life) reveals, through his rapid, mobile brush-strokes, the mastery of the artist over the ephemeral gleams on the water. The picture, one of the works of the series of the Water-Lilies, broke the record of the artist at auction, for he has had a smack of his own in it. The picture’s provenance, after having remained in the same private collection for forty years, has doubtless added to the keen interest in the bidding. Art historians regard the period when this picture was painted as the culminating point of Monet’s genius, when his technique had grown towards a more abstract style. The house said that Asian collectors had shown a particular interest in the sale of impressionists. The sale attracted the attention of collectors from all over the world, and five candidates vied with each other for the masterpiece, which was acquired in the end by an anonymous telephone bidder.",
        " Tom D’Oench’s slender ball from the flank of the enemy’s left side was Ben Davies’ last effort, after having disconcerted Spurs for an hour by a careful defensive performance and several threatening counter-attacks. After a bad first half, Tottenham had bettered themselves in the second, and Ben Davies’ cleverly timed run to meet James Maddison’s cross was the goal that gave the Londoners the lead their second-half performance deserved. This seemed to be the result of Ange Postecoglou’s half-time talk, for Tottenham came out after the interval more energetically. The visitors began to tire, and Tottenham were now in control, with Dejan Kulusevski working hard in the centre. Then, after Son Heung-min’s shot hit the post, the opponents began to tire. Postecoglou would be glad of the draw that would keep the cup from being lost to the visitors, though questions must be asked about the erratic first-half performances that have become a feature of their season. Despite a late comeback by the Championship side, Tottenham held on to reach the third round.",

Medicine: studies on the bone loss, on atrophy, on the heart, give medical data on the prevention of osteoporosis and of heart disease on earth.... The ISS is a platform, which serves as a platform, for experiments, that are impossible on earth, for the study of the micro-gravity environment, of the effects of cosmic rays on the organism. In biology: the study of how plants and organisms develop without gravitational influences gives insights into fundamental biological processes. In physics: to test theories about fluid dynamics, combustion, quantum phenomena, which are impossible on earth.

In the study of the environment: it serves as a test platform for life support, for radiation protection, for the study of the development of the atmosphere, the study of climate change.

        " Mr Keates also expressed his concern at the way in which the number of unqualified teachers is growing. According to Keates, government policies that allow academies and free schools to hire unqualified teachers were undermining educational standards. ... Teaching is a complex profession that requires specialised skills, knowledge and training. When we allow people who are not properly qualified to take on full teaching responsibilities, we are putting children’s futures at risk. The Department for Education has responded by pointing out that schools should be allowed to have the flexibility to hire staff however they see fit, with the aim of maximising the educational outcomes for children. The union has collected data showing that nearly one in five schools are now using unqualified teachers to fulfil roles previously fulfilled by qualified teachers, often as a result of budget cuts. What is at stake is the future of our children’s education. It highlights the wider tensions in education policy over the future of our profession, teacher recruitment and the need to maintain educational standards at a time of ever-increasing budgetary pressures.",

        " It is a very important index of the state of trade and is used as a guide to the state of the service industry which is a major sector in developed economies. The Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the service sector fell to 52.7 in January. A value above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, but there was a decrease in the previous reading, which suggests that although the services sector continues to expand, the rate of expansion is slowing down. The question that economists ask themselves is whether this represents a temporary slowdown or a prolonged deceleration, especially if it is compared to other indicators. This slowdown in services growth may be caused by several factors: an increase in the price of inputs, a decrease in the willingness of consumers to spend, a change in the labour market, and ongoing economic uncertainty.",

The twenty-five-year-old midfielder had been approached by Dundee United and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, but, after careful thought, he has decided to stay at the club and has signed a contract extension until 2026. ' It was a big relief for the coach that we had a player of that caliber in the ranks, he said. We have a special style of play, and it would have been a big blow to lose him to a direct rival. The interest of other clubs was flattering, but I believe we are building something here and I want to be a part of it.'

        " A number of inscriptions, which can be found in the village of Sharnford, astonish the passers-by by their length and grandeur. In one street, which juts out into the street at an angle, the inscription: The Local Authority has been abolished in favour of the Village Improvement Order. It is on the first of March that the erections at Sharnford were destroyed by a strong gale and by the rain; there was a shower of bricks on the street; a flood of water rose from the street and froze upon the road; a school of learning and culture at nearby Brundy, was established, and the village was able to get its independence from the county council; and a number of other local bodies devoted to the common good. The most important of these, the Village Speed Watch Association, whose members had used police-sanctioned devices for measuring speed, presented their data to the authorities, hoping that they would agree to the imposition of restrictions. But the police announced that patrols in the area would be increased, and that mobile speed cameras would be set up, if necessary. The chairman of the association said: The local councillors have promised to review the situation and to consider the possibility of reducing the speed limit, or even of modifying the layout of the road.

        " As I had mentioned, it was not until December that Tim Peake joined the International Space Station, but today, in a special live linkup, he was able to give the schoolchildren the opportunity to ask him questions and to watch some experiments involving the effects of weightlessness. The British spaceman has now been in space for six weeks, but he was able to make time to speak to the children and to show them some experiments. “Inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers is vital,” he said, “they could design the next generation of spacecraft or go to Mars in the future.” During the twenty-minute broadcast, he showed the children how a drop of water in zero gravity forms a perfect sphere, and he explained to them how the bodies of the International Space Station’s crew manage to eat, sleep and exercise while they orbit the Earth at a speed of more than 28,000 kilometres an hour. It is expected that the British spaceman will stay on board the International Space Station until June, where he will be carrying out research and maintenance work for the Expedition 46/47 crew.",
        " Residents of a quiet, suburban area had been smelling for a few days a strong, foul odor, supposedly a dead animal or a sewage problem. But as the odor persisted and intensified, it began to worry the neighbors. Then, in March, the neighborhood was drawn to the object of the contamination. They found the odor in a derelict warehouse located on the edge of the neighborhood, and on entering the building, the workers found large containers leaking whose contents had been dumped there. After several complaints to the municipality, the authorities sent the maintenance department to investigate. The latter discovered that the containers contained toxic substances, which had been deliberately dumped, in a violation of the regulations of the environment. The responsible people were immediately put on trial for these serious offenses against the environment, which the laws of the state denounce. The place was then closed off and a specialized unit of sanitary work was immediately called in to prevent contamination of the soil and groundwater.",

If you require information about child protection agencies or the means of reporting child abuse, I would be happy to provide it.

Universities UK, which represents over 140 UK institutions, campaigned for continued EU membership; since the vote, a number of issues have arisen: # Funding and access to research collaboration * The UK was one of the main recipients of EU research funding and the recipient of about €7 billion from the Horizon 2020 program * Universities fear losing access to important European research networks and collaborative opportunities * The UK is now affiliated to Horizon Europe after a protracted negotiation process, but it has been a number of years of uncertainty and disruption * Staff mobility and retention * Concerns about the ability to attract and retain talented academic staff from across Europe * The new visa and other administrative processes will make the UK less attractive as a study destination for European academics * Universities will need to turn to other funding sources to make up for the revenue shortfall resulting from the drop in the number of European students * The loss of tuition and residence allowances for European students has made the UK education system significantly more expensive for Europeans * The abolition of the home tuition fees, as a means of preventing the brain drain from abroad.",
        " “And in the end Ivan’s life was short, as it had been one long, long struggle against the disease that had been his curse all his short life: he suffered from cerebral palsy, and, as I am informed, from a pronounced attack of the brain fever. His death occurred in the remand hospital in St. Mary’s, London, on the 25th of February, following a fit. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who himself had suffered the loss of a child, offered his condolences. The Prime Minister was in the opposition party at the time, and was himself touched by the grief of the death of Ivan. The Camerons have said that Ivan’s death had deeply shocked them. In memory of Ivan they later established a charity for the assistance of the families of sick children. In his memoirs David Cameron has spoken of how Ivan had influenced his views on the question of health and disability, and of how the loss of a child had profoundly changed him as a person and as a politician.",

        " With the antecedent of having received the refusal of two or three inscriptions of 72 and 80 million pounds from Liverpool, it is hardly surprising that the Catalans have only now succeeded in making a deal for £142,750,000, which would make the player the second-most expensive footballer in the world after Neymar. The ex-Tottenham player, who is now 29, is the first purchase since Neymar's emigration to Paris-St-Germain, which cost him more than two hundred million pounds. “I am very happy to be here,” said the Brazilian. “It is a dream come true and I hope to meet expectations on the field.” He had arrived at Liverpool from Inter for a sum of eight million pounds in 2013. He had signed a contract with a value of 400 million euros, a buy-out clause of £35 million. Valverde, the coach of Barcelona, was happy with the operation. “He is a very versatile player and will bring something special to the team,” he said.",
        " Adebayo Akinfenwa, the star striker, who, after leaving A.F.C.W., had won the Division Three title, and who had been given a cult status among football devotees, has joined Wycombe, after being released from the A.F.C.W. The A.F.C.W. striker, whose name has become synonymous with the stoutness of the human body, is now, at the age of thirty-four, famous for his massive physique, and is known as the Beast. He arrived at High Wycombe on Sunday. I have had many battles against Wycombe over the years and have always admired the way they play. Akinfenwa, whose strength is rated 97 in the popular F. A. W. game, has, in his twenty years’ career, played for many clubs, among them Northampton, Gillingham, and Swansea. The new manager, Gareth Ainsworth, expressed his delight at the transfer, saying: “To have a player of his experience, character, and ability in the squad is an exciting prospect. He is a unique player who will bring something different to our attacking play, and is already fitting in well with the squad.”",
        " It was the third day of the tour when the match was postponed because of the bad weather at Manchester. The ground staff had worked the whole morning and, after an inspection at 12:25, the match was cancelled. The persistent rain had left the outfield too wet to allow the match to go ahead, disappointing the crowd of people who had braved the bad weather. Tomorrow’s forecast was good, so England would have to wait until then to press home their advantage. The umpires had consulted both captains, but had reached the conclusion that the outfield would not be fit enough for a match. The two teams went back to their hotels and would resume tomorrow at the normal time, weather permitting. This interruption in the match would give the visitors a chance to get a rest and rethink their strategy after yesterday’s gruelling session.",
        " In their seven years in the second division the club had had a number of near misses, several seasons ending in mid-table, all of which had strained the patience of their supporters. Robinson's leadership, however, had taken them back to the First Division after a seven-year stay in the Second, which was a great success for the manager and his team. The first season had been a combination of good defending and effective attacking, particularly in the final months when the pressure was on. Some of the players had surprised everyone by their abilities under Robinson's leadership. The club had been on the verge of bankruptcy when he had been appointed but his re-building programme soon regained the trust of the sceptics. Robinson's next task was to consolidate the team in the higher division. Keeping hold of his star players and bolstering his squad were the priorities for the coming season.",
        " Management assured that new and increased capacity had been installed and all security risks repaired, but in spite of this, skepticism was high among both users and experts. After last week's failure, many of the users doubted that the system could stand the anticipated increase in demand. The circumstances could not be worse; the quarterly reporting deadline was approaching, and the regulations regulating the Bank's operation could not be postponed.

        " While he had made 37 appearances for Mansfield Town last season, scoring four goals, he had been left out of the new management at the Field Mill. The Stags had let the midfielder, who was only 24, go, but after long negotiations between the clubs, the player’s representatives persuaded them to let him go. But it was not without regret for the Englishman, who had signed a contract that was to run out in six months. But, despite that, the new head coach of Mansfield, Phil Bignot, announced that it was the kind of player he was looking for and was of the energetic, technical and hungry character that they were looking for. The player was expected to go straight into the squad and make his debut this weekend, if his registration was completed in time. It was Bignot’s third recruit for the window, and he was aiming to get a good second half to the season. At the age of 24, he still had his best years ahead of him, and we were very pleased that we had him for free.",
        " The injury was a major blow to the player and to the team that he joined on loan from Chelsea. He had been an asset to the attacking team and was the starting player in the last five games and he had scored two assists. The doctor said that he was missing a hamstring injury that he had suffered in the last game against Fenerbahce. \"We are sorry to miss him at such a critical time in our work,\" said Kasimpasa's general manager Sami Ugurlu, \"but we have to keep him fit for the time being so that he can contribute to the best of his abilities when he comes back. \" Chelsea has been in contact with the Kasimpasa medical staff to monitor the situation, and he is expected to be absent for three weeks. He is expected to stay in Istanbul instead of returning to London to recover, as both clubs think it will be best for him.",

School authorities announced that in the following weeks they would give the pupils and teachers opportunities for counsel. Mayor Hoffman spoke, his voice breaking as he said: \"The unthinkable has happened, and the shock of it has reached every heart in this close-knit community. \" \"We have always been a community that looks after one another,\" said Mrs. Weber, who was in her seventy-third year, \"and now more than ever we have to stand together.\" Neighbours brought in food for the bereaved families; and the various committees of the community arranged support for those most directly affected.

The scene was rapidly cleared, and the passengers were evacuated from the station. London Fire Brigade men went into the tube to investigate the cause of the smoke. The initial suspicion was that it was an electrical fault, or overheating equipment in the service rooms, although the authorities have yet to make a definite statement. In the meantime, a temporary stoppage was announced at the station, and alternative transport arrangements were recommended, as local buses were already in great demand. Meanwhile, police established a cordon of safety around the entrances, and the local businesses were warned. There have been no reports of injuries.",

The gangs were mainly composed of young people and teenagers. They were primarily found in the vicinity of the market place and the riverside, and the police were called in to deal with them. Inspector Helen Morris said, “We are aware of the concerns raised by the community and are taking them seriously. We have been informed of a number of incidents involving benches being damaged, vandalism to the market place, and disorderly behaviour on the part of the young people towards passers-by. Several shopkeepers have also complained about shoplifting and littering outside their premises. Community leaders have also requested that more youth facilities be made available in the area. The town council is considering other measures to deal with the problem, including improving lighting in problem areas and considering the possibility of installing CCTV cameras. In the meantime, our officers will be conducting increased patrols in the affected areas, and we will be working with the local businesses and the town council to try to deal with the problem.”",

This reflects the stance of the Social Democrats in refusing to work with parties that the Chancellor views as xenophobic and anti-immigrant. But despite such statements, Austria has seen a number of coalition governments over the years, and the FP has always been represented in them. The dilemma between political principles and governing coalitions is one of the main challenges of the multi-party system in Austria. Chancellor Christian Kern’s statement is in line with the old cordon sanitaire that has always been drawn around those parties regarded as right-wing or extreme.",

At the end of a thrilling finish, Greece's Spiros Gianniotis had to give up his gold medal to make way for Ferry Weertman of the Netherlands. \"I had no idea who had won when I touched the finish line,\" Weertman admitted later, \"I just put my hand on the scoring pad and looked at the judge.\" After nearly two hours the finish was only a hundredth of a second and both were rushing forward at the same time. At 36 years old, the Greek veteran was named the winner at first, but then the scoring error came to light and he showed remarkable sportsmanship despite his disappointment. It was only when the results were announced that Weertman realized he was Olympic champion. The third medal went to Marc-Antoine Olivier of France, who was close behind the leading pair.",

        " Having made their move, the financial arrangements came under close scrutiny. This was a matter of dispute in the public debate which followed the signing of the lease. The London Olympic Development Company, which owns the stadium, refuted any suggestion that it was subsidizing West Ham United’s rent. Then, in 2016, after a freedom of information request and a legal challenge, the terms of the lease were finally made public. The lease was for 99 years and was for the use of the stadium for 25 days a year, with the rent of £2.5 million. This was put to the test when critics argued that most of the running costs of the stadium, which included security, maintenance and converting the field between football and athletics, were being paid by the taxpayer. The ongoing costs have led to an argument over whether the deal was a good investment for the taxpayer and whether the legacy of the Olympic games had been properly exploited. In fact, the document revealed that the costs of the corner flags, goalposts and even the under-soil heating were being paid for by the taxpayer, rather than the club.",

        " Indeed, as a player Simeone was unique, winning 106 caps for Argentina, becoming the master of the dummy in Serie A with Inter and Lazio, and then leading Atletico to the historic double in the first season of the new century. I apologize for underestimating him as a player, he was indeed a superb dummy whose merit deserves a due consideration. His former playing style has clearly had a strong influence on his teachings: in just five years, after returning to Atletico as a coach in 2011, Simeone has turned his team into a permanent contender. He played with the same concentration and tactical intelligence that later would define his way of teaching: tenacious in the challenge, brilliant in position, technically competent and able to be a leader. His tactics have become his hallmark: disciplined defense, compact structure and an effective counterattack. His critics call it defensive or pragmatic, but with this Simeone has always managed to compete with more capital to obtain. He broke the Barcelona-Real Madrid hegemony by winning the title in the 13-14 season, reached the final of the Champions League in 2014 and 2016, and won the league again in the 2121-22 season. His emotional contact with the Atletico faithful, his passionate relationship with the crowd and his ability to gain fierce loyalty from the players have turned him into a Metropolitan icon.",

This sort of incident has become a matter of great concern in recent seasons and the FA has been given more power to bring charges based on the evidence of film when the referee and his assistants have missed something during the game. The club had until a certain date to come forward with a plea or to dispute the charges. The player was facing a three-match ban if he was found guilty.",

        " At the service, which had brought together diplomats from all over the world, all the doctrinal differences were set aside for a while in the depth of grief. They all knew the Ambassador, Andrey Karlov, whose death had sent a tremor through the diplomatic world, a tremor of the dangers that resented themselves, and through which, from time to time, one of the pitfalls that lay behind the amiable calm of diplomatic life. There had been new security measures since the murder: the armed guards were more visible, the control more thorough. A kind of cautiousness had come over the diplomatic corps. Marie, who had been working with Karlov on several joint projects, recalled their last meeting, just three weeks before the murder, a conversation on cultural exchanges, now almost boring, but which, in retrospect, seemed so normal. “He believed in dialogue, even when it seemed impossible,” the minister said in his speech, “and the best service we can do to him is to continue the work he started.” But they continued their work, perhaps even with more determination, in quiet defiance of those who wanted to destroy the delicate threads of diplomacy with violence.",
        " Those who take Karl Robinson's place as manager of MK Dons will have to work to remove a mark that he has left after more than half the history of the club. His six years as manager have been a time of stability and identity for a club that has struggled to find its place in the footballing landscape, and for the new manager, it is not only a matter of guiding a team, but also a legacy that he has carefully built up. His doctrine of a possession-based, attractive style of football has become synonymous with the Milton Keynes club. Now it is a matter of respecting this foundation while introducing new ideas. During his time at the club, Robinson led the Dons to promotion to the Championship in 2015, which was the pinnacle of the club's short history. The transition to a new coach comes at a critical time for the club, and there are still questions about whether the new manager will seek to build on Robinson's possession-based approach, or whether they will be able to forge a new identity. The stadium is waiting for a new voice, a new way of thinking, and perhaps above all a new relationship with the fans, who have only known one voice from a coach for so long. Certainly, whoever takes over from Robinson will need time to put their own vision into action, to win over the dressing room and to persuade the fans that a club still in its infancy can still promise the future. Either way there are risks in a league where the margin between success and failure is razor-thin.",
        " The experts worked with a magnifying glass to reassemble pieces of pottery found among the sand and stones that had been removed from the site, which is known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Al-Haram al-Sharif. The temples were considered to be from the time of the Second Temple (from 516 BCE to the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in AD 70), and were thus able to discover an invaluable piece of evidence from one of the world's most important and religiously significant sites. These discoveries contribute to our knowledge of the architectural evolution of the site, while carefully avoiding the delicate religious and political aspects of archeological research in Jerusalem. This work has produced thousands of artifacts, from the coins of the ancients to Byzantine mosaics, which have helped to deepen the scientific understanding of the history of this complex and sacred site.

Among them are the experienced striker, Danny Rose, from Stevenage, and the midfielder, Joshua Laurent, who has come from Reading on a free transfer. The Gills finished bottom of League One last season, and have brought in eight new men. They need fresh blood after a difficult campaign, says Bonner, and the players he has brought in will bring that good blend of experience, quality and appetite that will help the club improve its league position. Among the defensive reinforcements brought in are George Edmundson, a central defender, and the right-back, Max Clark. A pre-season schedule is already in place and includes matches against local non-league opposition, with a match against a Championship side scheduled for the following week. During his interviews, Bonner said he was looking for two or three more players before the window closed, but was focusing on those with attacking qualities.",

        " The railway between Dawlish and Teignmouth is a vital connection between the counties of Cornwell and Devon and the rest of the United Kingdom. The line is already exposed to difficulties through its exposure to the sea. Climate change projections for the region indicate a sea-level rise of between 1.8 and 3.1 metres by 2100. In a severe storm in the winter of 2014 the sea wall at Dawlish was breached, the line was closed for two months, and an estimated economic loss of £1,000,000,000. This incident served to highlight the vulnerability of the line at the present time. The consequences of a rise in sea-level for the line will be the following: (1) a rise in the frequency of flooding; by 2060 it is expected that flooding events will occur with a frequency 200 to 300% higher than now, with the consequent increased frequency of disruption to the railway service; (2) increased inundation; (3) accelerated coastal change, with the consequent threat to the line of stability. (4) Structural Damage: with repeated exposure to storm surges the deterioration of the sea defences and the track itself will accelerate. Network Rail has begun a programme of resilience which includes: – a new sea wall at Dawlish – cliff strengthening between Dawlish and Teignmouth – an improvement to the drainage system. – A further major investment in sea defences will be needed in the longer term, as well as more extensive measures such as re-routing parts of the line inland. The line is an important lifeline for the people of the region, bringing in over four million passengers a year. It supports a tourism industry that accounts for some 13% of the region’s economy. It is an essential means of transport for people living in isolated parts of Cornwell and West Devon, where there are few alternative transport links.",

Mr. Davis maintains that in the case of Scotland a different arrangement is required, which would address the special population problems that Scotland faces. This disagreement shows the lack of harmony between the two in their positions over the extent of devolved powers after the Brexit. The Scottish National Party has been arguing for a differentiated deal with the European Union, which would give it closer links with the Union, because of the high number of Scottish people who voted to remain in the UK in the 2016 plebiscite. The UK government has promised to transfer some of the powers of the European Union to the devolved administrations, but has also said that certain policy areas, including control of free movement of people, will continue to be managed at a national level.",
        " “We are delighted to welcome him back into the squad,” said the Director of Cricket. “Having had such a successful international career we are delighted to have him back for the second half of the season.” In 2011 he had played for the county and helped it to the final of the domestic Twenty20 tournament and the semi-final of the Champions League. The all-rounder spoke of his delight at returning to familiar surroundings. “The club gave me my first opportunity to play English cricket and I have many happy memories of my time here. “His experience and skill with both bat and ball will be invaluable to us as we try to get a trophy this season.” He has since played in 45 Test matches and over 100 one-day internationals for his country. In his previous stint at the county he had scored over 500 runs in all competitions and taken 22 wickets with his medium pace bowling. “The fans were always great and I look forward to playing for them again.” But the return of the all-rounder is seen as a response to the county’s need to strengthen the squad, particularly in the forthcoming Twenty20 campaign.",
        " An independent rescue boat has been given to Foyle Search and Rescue and Lagan Search and Rescue. The equipment will be used to assist in the rescue work on the rivers in Northern Ireland. Foyle Search and Rescue and Lagan Search and Rescue have been named as two of 67 charities in the UK that are set to benefit from a rescue boat grant scheme, aimed at helping voluntary rescue boat operators buy essential equipment to maintain their rescue operations. The scheme, now in its eighth year, has now provided more than £5.8 million to charities operating in the water. A spokesman for the Department of Transport said: \"These volunteer groups play an essential role in keeping our waterways safe. This funding recognizes their dedication and ensures they have the resources they need to respond effectively to emergencies. \" The two Northern Irish charities thanked the government for its support, saying it would allow them to respond to incidents more effectively and perhaps save more lives. The grant will be used to buy new boats, engines, life jackets and other rescue equipment.",
        " A HISTORY AFRICAN CARNIVAL. Founded in Nevis by Arthur France in 1967, the Leeds Carnival was the first carnival in Europe, in which costumes, music and masquerading were all in place. It was an instant success and has been held every year since, and has become one of the highlights of the city’s cultural calendar. PUBLIC IS ENTILED TO GET TO KNOW THIS YEAR THINGS TO EXPECT THIS YEAR. Visitors to Potternewton Park can expect: Stunning costumes parades with hand-crafted designs. Live music from calypso, reggae and steel-pan bands. Caribbean food stalls offering a variety of authentic cuisines. Family-friendly activities throughout the weekend. The famous J’ouvert morning that starts off the festival. The parade starts at Potternewton Park and moves through the streets of Harehills and Chapeltown, returning to the park for more fun. If you are going to the Carnival, you are advised to use public transport as there is limited parking in the area.",

        " Besides the technical and financial support it offers, the Oie-Gaz Techno-Centree (OGTC) is a strategic intermediary between small companies and major oil companies. It also reduces financial barriers to innovation, enabling promising projects to reach the stage of development and implementation. These actions are in response to several major challenges: a scale mismatch between small technical companies and large international oil companies, with differing organisational structures, procedures and risk appetites. The need for the OGTC to provide technological assessment. With its testing facilities and industry contacts, the OGTC is able to check that new developments meet the standards required for oil and gas operations. Access to the industry: the OGTC provides technological development companies with access to decision-makers and potential customers, which they would not otherwise have been able to reach. The model adopted by the OGTC enables new developments to be brought to market more quickly, facilitating the growth of small companies and helping the oil industry to become more efficient, safer and greener. Collaborative development: the OGTC facilitates joint projects in which the innovations of small companies are developed and refined with the input of industry experts.",
        " Instead of being imprisoned in police cells, he had been treated by the medical services. Since the beginning of the year, he had not resorted to this means, but had worked with the medical services to find other means of getting the sick to receive proper care without reserving places for them in police cells. The directives recommended by the Ministry of Health also recommend that the detainees of the Mental Health Act be treated in health facilities rather than in police cells. Psychologists have welcomed this change because police cells are unsuitable for people suffering from a mental illness. However, there is still a lot of work to do to improve the response to mental crises in the region.",
        " The police were summoned at about twenty-five minutes after twenty-four on Tuesday and found a 46-year-old man with severe injuries. The ambulance service was called but despite all their efforts, the man was declared dead at the scene. The officer leading the investigation, Detective Inspector Frankie Fraser, said, “We are treating this death as suspicious and would like to hear from anyone who was in the area around Gordon Street between about five and seven on Tuesday evening. The area was cordoned off and a full investigation launched into the circumstances surrounding the death. Forensics teams are carrying out a thorough examination of the scene and detectives are completing door-to-door enquiries in the local area. Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101 quoting incident number 3542 of Tuesday or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

        " The study was confined to identical areas and to the same diagnostic criteria for both periods, so that the comparisons were reliable. Using data collected over a period of twenty years, the research suggests that there may be a significant change in the rate of increase of dementia in the UK. These new data show that there are approximately 20 per cent fewer new cases of dementia than in the previous two decades. The study also highlights the importance of public health campaigns aimed at modifying risk factors for the onset of dementia. Several factors could be responsible for this encouraging trend, including better health management of heart conditions, better education for newer generations, a healthier diet, less smoking, and more physical exercise. A similar trend in other countries needs to be investigated to see if the reduction can be maintained.",
        " This mission is to signal to Libya the great importance that Great Britain attaches to the support of its weak unity government, which is faced with the greatest difficulties, notably the division of political parties, the delimitation of territories, and the presence of various armed groups and ISIS in parts of the country. The Secretary of State’s visit to Tripoli is intended to provide visible support for the young National Government. Western powers see in the GNA the best hope of regaining stability in Libya and reducing the migratory flow to Europe through the Mediterranean. His visit also shows the fears that are being voiced in the region of Libya becoming a failed state that could give rise to terrorism and organised crime, and threaten regional security. In particular, the Secretary of State’s visit is to establish relations of mutual security cooperation, the possibility of economic assistance, and the means of reuniting the country’s fractured administrative structures. The mission is to be part of a large international effort to help the GNA to establish its legitimacy and authority throughout the country.",
        " The hosts scored a well-worked goal in the 37th minute, which sparked off wild celebrations in the packed stands. After a goalless draw away from home, the Leopards, who were in a strong position at the start of the second leg, whose goal difference they needed to overturn, could not find the elusive winning goal despite the energetic support of a large crowd. The latter pressed hard in the second half, creating a number of promising situations, but the visitors' stubborn defence and a succession of wasted opportunities prevented them from snatching the crucial victory. The DR Congo's advance on the road to qualifying is a doubtful one. Despite this, the coach, Sébastien Desabre, declared himself very satisfied. “We had the opportunity to win, but football can sometimes be cruel. It is now up to us to pull ourselves together and focus on the task ahead.”",

        " The protesters, who were several hundred in number, carried placards stating that they were against the interference of the Teheran government in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. They especially protested against the supposed support of the Teheran government for factions in Afghanistan and its economic policy toward the refugees and the population on the borders. They held up banners, which stated that they were against the interference of the Teheran government in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. Some demanded that there should be a break in diplomatic relations. Despite their close ties, which go back a long way in history, culture and trade, the two neighbouring states have been plagued by difficulties since the reorganization of the Kabul government. Those defending the Teheran policy have always denied it and have said that they are acting only in the interests of the region and the well-being of the people of Afghanistan. The police kept order and maintained a ring round the embassy, but the protesters were very calm and it remained so throughout the demonstration.",

        " According to the Times Education Supplement, the measures taken to prevent inflation of English examinations are inappropriate and potentially unsuitable. The publication says that these precautions, apparently intended to maintain the quality of examining in the aftermath of the flu epidemic, failed to take account of the particular circumstances that these students had to face. The TES expressed concern that the rigid application of statistical controls could have had the unintended consequence of causing a further disadvantage to students who have already suffered from extensive disruption to their education. The TES quoted experts in education who suggested that, while still maintaining standards, the examination boards should take account of the exceptional circumstances of recent years. According to them, when establishing the boundaries for determining grades, the examination boards should consider the special circumstances in which this year’s students are taking their examinations rather than the statistical model that applied before the flu epidemic. Critics point out that these students have had to overcome an unprecedented set of challenges on their educational journey, not least of which was a loss of learning time due to the flu epidemic and the re-adjustment to the conditions of the examination. The TES recommends that a review be carried out of the assessment process in order to ensure fairness to students who have been subjected to such unusual influences.",

The six-foot-five actor had brain cancer, and he had been in New York City's \"Factory\" Hospital before his death on Wednesday. His family, which issued a statement, declared their profound sorrow and thanks to the doctors for the care they had given him during his last illness. The condolences from the actors, directors, and fans of all countries began to arrive. They remembered him not only for his artistic achievements but also for his reputation for benevolence and work. The representatives reported that he had been fighting the disease for several months. His family asked for privacy at this difficult time, but they also recommended that, instead of flowers, people donate to cancer research institutions. A funeral is being arranged.

        " In the year 2013, an incident took place that became a scandal in the public opinion, when, the daughter of Humberto Benitez Trevino, Prosecutor General of Mexico, who was then president of the aforementioned Council of Consumers’ Affairs, Andrea Benitez Gonzalez, got angry, because they would not seat her at the table she had reserved at Maximo Bistrot, a restaurant in Mexico City. ‘Do you know who I am?’ she allegedly said. ‘I’m going to call my father,’ and the moment this was published in the social networks, it was taken as an obvious abuse of power, and immediately the restaurant was closed by a visit of PROFECO inspectors, on the pretext of various violations of the code. The case became the emblem of the privileged conduct of the families of some high functionaries in Mexico, and a wider discussion was set in motion about the abuse of power and the accountability of officials. Under the rage of public opinion, the President Enrique Pea Nieto dismissed the prosecutor.",
        " In this car battery sized analytic laboratory the gas was then analysed by a set of chambers and sensors; and the gas sample was then subjected to a process of separation by means of gas chromatography, mass spectrometer and tunable diode spectrometer, in order to determine the exact composition of the atmosphere. The rover, the Curiosity of the American, drew the thin air of Mars into its sophisticated Sample Analyser for Mars (SAM) instrument, a highly developed device which, as it were, consisted of a set of chambers and sensors, and by means of a gas chromatograph, mass spectrometer and a tunable diode spectrometer, it analyzed the chemical composition of the atmosphere in minute detail. The detection of even the smallest trace elements of gases by the SAM apparatus would help scientists to understand the chemistry of the Martian atmosphere, the history of its climate, and the prospects for its habitability. The composition of the Martian atmosphere was analyzed: about 95% of carbon dioxide, 2.6% nitrogen, 1.86% argon, 0.16% oxygen and other trace elements, mainly methane, traces of carbon monoxide, water vapour and traces of other gases. Scientists were particularly interested in methane, which, according to the Martian scientists, could be a sign of biological or geological activity. The measurements were sent to Earth and the eager scientists studied the atmospheric traces, which gave a clue to the conditions of the current and the past on Mars.",
        " Just before half-time, England had scored a try, but indiscretion had allowed France to extend the lead again through a further penalty by Dimitri Yachvili, and although they rallied late in the game with a try by Mark Cueto, it was already too late. The first-half tries of Vincent Clerc and Maxime Medard gave France an advantage of 16 points, as England, after scoring several penalties, resorted to errors of all kinds, and were caught in the very act. France, so adroit and skilled, found their scoring opportunities, and built their game on the mass of their forwards, while England, who are young, were not equal to the intensity and precision of the hosts. This defeat put an end to England's chances of a slam since 2003, leaving Wales the only team that could still score all the points in the Six Nations. During long periods of the game, the English were completely outplayed, their scrums were under pressure, their lineouts drubbed, their handling was often at fault at key moments.",
        " Morquio disease, also known as Mucopolysaccharidosis IV, is a hereditary skeletal deformity, with a short stature, a curved spine, joint stiffness, and distinctive facial features. It is a failure of an enzymatic system, a lack of a protease which causes a build-up of certain granular products in the cells, the tissues and the organs. The disease is found only in a few persons in Wales. In recent years, it has been better treated with enzymatic substitution, and moreover the treatment has improved, which allows to soften the symptoms and to slow down the course of the disease. The patients, like Gracie, often need to be treated by several physiotherapists, orthopedists, cardiologists, respirologists. Physical development is affected, but intelligence is generally not. Awareness and support are vital to those affected by rare diseases like Morquio disease. A rare disease like Morquio presents the family with particular problems: it complicates the health care system and the learning environment.",

Those who were in the West Glacier area on Wednesday and have some information that could be of use in the investigation are asked to make contact with the investigators. It is reported that the victim may have been walking alone. The weather was sunny on Wednesday, so the question of natural causes does not seem to be a decisive factor. Authorities have temporarily closed certain tracks in the area while the investigation continues. The identity of the deceased is withheld pending notification of relatives.",
        " From the aforementioned Act of 1980, the Right to Buy was extended to all council tenants and their families, allowing them to buy their council houses at a greatly discounted price. Over one million council houses were sold under the programme, and many of these council tenants became Conservative voters. This was one of the great reforms of Thatcher's policy of disinvestment, which had dominated her period of office. The nationalisation of other companies such as British Airway, Rolls-Royce, British Steel, electricity and water companies was accompanied by the \"Tell Sid\" campaign, promoting share-ownership for the first time. The sale of shares in the national companies British Telecom in 1984 and British Gas in 1986 was presented as a campaign of popular capitalism, allowing the public to become shareholders. Yet, at the same time, this policy was controversial, as critics pointed out that the public assets sold were valued at less than their true value, and that if the houses were sold, the amount of money received from the sale would not be devoted to building new houses, thus exacerbated the housing shortage. The underlying reason for these policies was the goal of reducing state ownership of the economy and promoting private ownership and market competition. However, the Thatcher government's programme of privatisation had a deep influence on British economic thought, extending even after her period in office, and influencing similar policies internationally.",
        " On the edge of the meadowland of the battlefield, which the wild grass and wildflowers were gradually reclaiming, a ruined tank stood, its battered carcass encircled by a garland of fresh flowers. The bright, light-coloured petals, with a sprinkling of red, seemed odd against the cold metal, pitted by the bullet holes and rusting away through the years. Annually, on a certain day in early spring, an old man visited it. His walk grew more faltering with each visit. He would have carefully made a garland that morning, and carefully fastened it to the front of the tank. Occasionally children from the village played on it, climbing up the sides, pretending to be gunners, without knowing what history lay under their feet. Nobody in the village knew why he visited the tank, whether he had fought in it, against it, or had simply seen it, but they respected the ritual. On that day they stood respectfully at a distance, watching him, quietly observing his act of remembering. Then he would stand there in silence, his weathered hands joined together in front of him, remembering those who were now a memory. Perhaps he too had joined those he came to remember, leaving only this garland, a sign of the lasting memory of the wars long after the soldiers had been buried. Today the flowers were fresh, but the old man was not there.",
        " The great news of the Doctor's gender change was announced in July of the same year and constituted a turning point in the history of British science fiction. The announcement was that Jodie Whittaker was to become the Doctor Who, the thirteenth Time Lord, the first woman ever to take on the role. Whittaker starred in three seasons as the Doctor, before announcing her resignation. She rediscovered new perspectives on the character while maintaining the basic traits of compassion, curiosity, and help with the race and all of space and time. Her role was subsequently taken over by Ncuti Gatwa, who took over as the fifteenth Doctor following the brief return of David Tennant as the fourteenth Doctor. Her time in the TARDIS added to the series' mythology and showed that the Doctor's essence is independent of gender.",
        " The club is delighted to have been able to clinch such a talent and the manager has spoken of a player who is ‘a perfect fit for our playing philosophy’ and ‘someone who will become a world-class performer’. The fee agreed for the 20-year-old international, who has played 10 times for his country, is said to be more than the £175,200 paid for Birmingham City’s Alan Buckley in 1979, and the Englishman thus becomes the club’s most expensive signing ever, surpassing a long-standing record which has been in place for more than forty years. The fee, which is said to be in the region of £2.5 to £3 million, is yet to be officially confirmed by either club. It is a bold move by the board of directors as they seek to strengthen their squad for the new season. The player himself was at the training ground yesterday to have a medical and sign the contract and said to the assembled reporters that he was ‘delighted to be joining a club with such a strong history’ and that he was ‘ready to meet the supporters and show them what he could do on the pitch’.",

        " The timber industry is afraid that the government is more and more focused on the protection of the environment, and that the importance of commercial timber production is being ignored. It points out that the domestic timber industry is an important source of income, that it creates rural jobs, that it reduces the need for imports and that, if managed properly, it can be good for the environment. Critics of the current policy say that forestry policy should have designated areas for commercial timber production as well as for conservation, instead of applying the same restrictions to all forest areas. They want a more nuanced approach that recognizes the different benefits that different forest types can provide. They point out that well-managed, commercial forests can absorb carbon dioxide and, at the same time, provide a renewable material that has a lower carbon footprint than alternatives like concrete or steel. This debate reveals the challenge that is always present in resource management, that is the balance between the need for conservation and the need for economic activity.",
        " “I’m a little bit like a terminator now,” she said, laughing, with a hint of pride in her voice. The accident happened at a very crucial time in her career and, like the T-800 from the famous film series, she rebuilt herself—stronger, more determined, with a plate of Titanium and six screws on her ankle. Her rehabilitation was difficult. Months of physical therapy, a different exercise program and the mental battle of learning to trust her body again constantly put her to the test. “The doctors said that I might never be able to compete at the top level, but I didn’t want to hear that. I wanted to compete at the highest level again.” “The artificial parts on my ankle sometimes get me through security checks at the airport,” she admits with a laugh. But they also remind me of the difficulties I have overcome. With the same discipline and determination that helped her get through the harsh winters in Scotland and early-morning training sessions she worked through the setbacks. “I am literally running on metal,” she thinks, “when the pain hits in the last kilometer. That gives me a certain power.”",
        " Sir Tim O’Shea warned that elections to governing boards of universities were inconsistent, incoherent and potentially damaging. He explained that they could endanger strategic decision-making by bringing in a political element. He warned that elections would inevitably produce a politician who was forced to represent the views of his voters rather than the university’s academic future and long-term strategy. The defenders of electoral reform said that democracy would increase transparency and accountability and bring in the views of the university’s public. O’Shea also claimed that the proposal failed to take account of the complexity of university governance and the tensions between academic freedom, fiscal responsibility and regulatory compliance.",
        " On August 15 th, at about 8 o’clock, I picked up my wife and children and set out for Kawuri in Chikwawa State. They had to leave their place of worship, home and business premises, because of the ongoing agitation and other violent activities. For the religious leaders in particular, it was often a double threat because they were often targeted for their faith and position as leaders. Like many others, they probably went to the big cities or to the refugee camps where there was a bit more security. I understand that they continue to do their pastoral work with the displaced, and they provide spiritual and material support.",
        " When I lost consciousness, something solid brushed my hand, I snatched at it and found something on the bank of the river, a root, a branch. I fought, the current dragging me deeper, my lungs burning. The branch cracked, held, and I clung to it, shivering, trembling. With the last of my strength, I pushed myself back against the water, tearing myself out. My head sank, I gulped in air between racking coughs. My clothes were heavy with water, and I was crawling a little further, when I stumbled on the muddy bank and fell exhausted. The noise of the rapids, which continued down the river, told me how close I had been to losing myself. It was only to figure out where I had been carried and how to get back. The rain continued to fall from the darkening sky, but I was alive.",

        " I had worked on the calculation for months, I had sat through countless nights, bent over the wires and the codes. The red light blinked again, but more slowly. My creation was coming to life before my eyes. Now it was two blinks, then three. The quantum computer hummed a little under its shell. I could hardly hear it, but I felt the vibrations through the console with my fingertips. The light pulsated in response, not an erratic blinking now, but a deliberate pattern of communication. \"Hello,\" I whispered, hardly daring to believe that it was working. On the monitors beside me, a data stream like a river flowed, organized into ever more complex structures. It wasn't artificial intelligence anymore, but a new beginning. The neural network learned from itself, the learning was growing more and more quickly with each second. I reached for the mic, my hand trembling a little. Something new, something that would finally understand the questions I needed to ask. Which question would I ask first? The red light was watching me, patiently, expectantly.",

        " The gleaming silicon facets, on the glistening silicon wafers, caught the fluorescent light, and moved to the testing area. Raj stopped working and watched the pieces of silicon glinting in the light of the fluorophore that shone above the workbench. The chips had been made with a great deal of care, and had to be perfect if they were to be used in the quantum project. The third one in the row that passed under the microscope, gave a yellow reading on the monitor. Then he raised his hand to stop the train of chips. “The quantum gate array has probably been affected,” he said, lifting the suspected chip with anti-static tweezers. “What’s the matter?” Maya enquired. He brought the chip under the microscope and when he drew it into focus, he saw the defect. It was so slight that many a technician would not have noticed it. The resonance frequency was fluctuating just outside the acceptable limits. “The lithography system will have to be adjusted,” he wrote in the log book. “If this continues, we may lose the entire batch.” After fifteen years in the business, he had developed an instinct for such things.",
        " The Two Children. Upon entering the Zoo, the children's eyes were full of delight, and the older one, Emma, who was the elder, was clutching the colored map in her hand. Max was jumping on tiptoe. “The lions,” he cried, pointing to a sign on which there was a silhouette of a big cat. “The lions!” cried Emma, looking at the winding paths of the map. The morning sun was shining on their shoulders as they approached the lions' cage. A splendid male was resting on a sun-warmed rock, and his mane was golden in the light. The stony road led past the flamingos, which stood on one leg, and they reached the African plain. After the lions, they saw the playful otters, the mighty giraffes, and were even present at the feeding of the penguins. “Look how big they are,” whispered Max, as he pressed his hands against the glass. A lioness was prowling along the fence of the enclosure with swift, slender steps. After that, they saw the wolves, foxes, rabbits, and then the badgers, before they reached the reptiles, where a blue morpho landed on Emma's shoulder for a moment. The afternoon was full of adventures in the lizard hut and the butterfly garden, where a blue morpho briefly alighted on Emma's shoulder. By midday, they were sitting at the jungle cafe with sandwiches and ice cream.",
        " All around me the diabolical noises grow louder. The sound of shrieking cats, wailing seals, metallic shrieks and the soul-crushing noise of scraping chalk on blackboard. My lungs are on fire and my feet pound the ground as I rush forward. I slash through the trees, leaping over logs and branches that are lashing my face. The sound is inexplicable, but it is getting closer. I dare to look behind me for a moment. Between the trees something is moving. Its shadow, as if dissolving and becoming, seems to move. I catch a root with my foot and almost stumble, but terror is propelling me on. Ahead of me is a narrow ravine with a small wooden bridge over it. Perhaps I could cross it and do something with the bridge... The sound is reaching me in waves, making the air thick and oppressive. I come upon the bridge. Behind me the noises grow louder as if they are alert to my desperate plan.",

To prove their point about adaptability. To develop new systems, new orientations in this confined space.’ A certain atmosphere, from time to time. A contemplative silence during the day, almost sleepy, now a heavy, more absolute silence is descending. But I can’t stop talking to myself. Not out loud, but in my head. A full-scale conversation.’ Perhaps both. Is it a sign of something, or just the inevitable reaction of the mind to seclusion?’",

In a fit of emotion, he cheered as he watched his fellow men sowing the chaos which was needed to disturb the world's corrupt systems. ‘They can no longer ignore us,’ he whispered, watching the demonstrations grow from hour to hour. He looked at his monitor and saw the same scenes repeated in other cities all over the world. His investigational blog had long since been exposing the wrongs of the world's corporations, and it was finally coming to the point where people would finally take notice. He smiled with satisfaction. His cell phone beeped with a text from Maya, his insider at the top of GlobalCorp: ‘Emergency board meeting. They're in a panic about the data leak.’ ‘It is only when the people want it that the system changes,’ he murmured and reached for his jacket. It was time to go down to the streets, to take part in the movement he had helped to bring about. The encrypted files he had helped to make public had done exactly what they were supposed to do: revealed the lies of the environment violations and tax evasions that had been hidden for decades.",
        " The young beauty opposite me was tucking a piece of her hair behind her ear, and glancing around the glass cabinet. “What’s the good thing to see today?” I was leaning forward a little, and trying to maintain a friendly but professional air. “I can’t decide between the toffee latte and the hazelnut mocha,” she said with a laugh. “What do you think?” She glanced up at the menu one more time, then turned to me with a decisive nod. “The hazelnut mocha is our specialty. We make the chocolate sauce ourselves and it makes a lot of difference, but the toffee latte has a lot of fans too.” “Well, that’s what I’d go for,” I said, and I reached for a cup. “Hazelnut mocha, then, medium, please.” “And can I get your name on it?”",
        " The inscription seems to have been composed by two people whose dialogue is to the effect that one asks the other, ‘Have we met before?’ and the other replies, ‘Have we met before?’ It is as if one recognizes the other, but the other has not recognized him. ‘I was wondering when you would notice it.’ If you wish me to expound this dialogue further or to ask me any questions about it, please let me know. The second person seems to be a little amused that the first person takes so long to ask whether they have met before.",
        " The camp, deep in the hollow of a gorge whose sides were smoothed by the passage of the water, was composed of tents, dotted like mushrooms after a rain, and their cloths swelled softly under the evening breeze which never failed to find its way into the gorge. The limestone cliff glowed in the last rays of the setting sun, turning the pallid rock into a picture of amber and rose. Some savory smells escaped from a blackened pot hanging above the embers, and voices, sometimes magnified, sometimes absorbed by the stone, mingled, thus creating a continual ringing of conversations, laughter and song. Around the hearth, which served as a kind of hearthstone, figures moved with the well-trained movements of those who had for the moment made of this forgotten place their home. One by one, a few stars appeared in the depths of the blue, promising a clear night to this wilderness, at once so exposed and so hidden. High above, between the two walls of the gorge, the evening stars were spotted on a streak of blackened sky.",
        " “That’s not exactly what I said,” I replied, choosing my words with care. I shifted in my chair, the leather creaking. The room was suddenly too small with the heavy figure blocking the daylight of the window. The Italian’s face was still unmoved, but the corners of his mouth twitched with a faint smile. “I said we had a problem that needed to be solved. How you choose to interpret it is your affair.” “Problems do have solutions,” he said in a thickening accent, “but solutions do have their price. And problems have their price too.” He took out a handkerchief and mopped his brow despite the coolness of the room. It wasn’t the path I had expected to take, but desperate situations can sometimes redraw moral boundaries. “Do you understand me?” I nodded slowly and reached for the envelope in my desk. “When the problem is solved,” he replied, stuffing the envelope into his pocket without examining its contents. “It’s not the how, but the that counts,” he said in English. “How will I know it’s all right...?” I couldn’t finish. He turned to go, his heavy steps ringing on the floor. “Don’t ask when. Better this way for both of us.”",
        " I was somewhere in the middle of a K-pop concert, or perhaps in the streets of Seoul? I opened my eyes slowly, and could not get rid of the lingering images of the swarthy men. I reached for my phone, the time was 6:43 AM. Too early to get up on a Saturday, but I was still fascinated by my dream. The details were already beginning to fade, like the morning mists. I was sure that I had seen the friendly faces of strangers, and heard them laughing, but could not make out the words. I turned over on my back and gazed at the ceiling, trying to recall the images. Perhaps it was that K-drama I’d been watching last night, or perhaps it was the kimchi I’d eaten for dinner. Maybe it didn’t really matter, just the random firing of brain cells during sleep. It is strange how the sleeping mind will assemble bits and pieces from our waking lives, to create its own stories. I thought of searching the Internet for a guide to dreams, but instead got up and made coffee. I’d been thinking of trying that new Korean restaurant downtown, I decided.",
        " It was a lifetime he had waited for. He stood at the threshold, the key in his hand trembling, and waited. The dust motes in the filtered light resounded through the smoke-stained windows. As he pressed the key into the lock, a snap-hissing sound came from the door that echoed in his ears, taking him back decades. His arthritic knees protested, but he went on, ascending the staircase. The stairway spiralled upwards like the enchanted one his grandfather had told him about as a child. The lighthouse keeper’s quarters had been exactly as he had described. He saw the bed, the desk, the shelves of log-books, the windows, the sunset, and his heart leapt. But what had captivated him was the lantern room at the very top. It was almost as if his grandfather had written the letter that was in his pocket: the letter his grandfather had written before his death, explaining why the lighthouse had to remain in the family and why it had to light up once more. The ancient lens was lying there, dark for so many years, and he ran his hand over the cool brass of the apparatus, feeling the life in it. Then he reached into his pocket and withdrew the yellowed envelope. It was time to know the truth at last.",
        " “Gentlemen,” the gorilla snarled, straightening his glasses of the same material with a touch of surprisingly delicate delicacy, “I think we have covered the quarterly forecasts well enough. The silverback sat erect in his high-backed armchair at the end of the board table and, as he came to a close, gazed at the heads of the Board of Directors with a concentrated look. ... The chairmen shifted uncomfortably. They had not expected the genetic engineering program to have such a rapid success, let alone that their first success would so quickly require a C-level position. The purchase of Rainforest will go ahead as planned.” “Any questions?” he asked, picking up his notepad and his banana milkshake. His brains were just as intimidating as his 800 pound grip. “If not, then this meeting is adjourned. I want the quarterly forecasts on the company’s social responsibility program on my desk by Thursday.” The board rose and left the room. Dr. Kigoma stared out of the ceiling-to-floor windows at the skyline of Midtown Manhattan. From misty forests to the heart of the metropolis... indeed, quite a journey.",
        " In the light, my morning hangover vanished in a flash, its mildness instantly melted into a suffocating ache behind my eyes that began to radiate outward like a blast wave. My heart was beating like a broken pump. It was as though my eyes were being sucked into a vortex of white, white to the point of pain. My only thought was to go back to the dark and die, but I could not. My hands groped around for the switch, desperately wishing to shut out the light, but I only managed to topple an empty glass from the bedside table, its tiny little whirls growing incredibly loud until they were reverberating through my ears like a bowling ball falling down concrete stairs. Water. The walk to the bathroom was like a journey across the desert. I had to have water. And perhaps death, too, but water first. The face in the mirror was like a stranger’s, puffy, white, its eyes a tiny crimson world, and I whispered to myself, “Never again!” like a promise I had already made a dozen times. Each step was an ordeal of negotiating with my own body, which was rebelling and wanted to remind me of all the mistakes I had made the night before.",
        " \"Nothing! Just some, uh, normal, er, usual repair work,\" the robot stammered, while its optical sights zigzagged anxiously back and forth. Its skinny metallic arms remained awkwardly stretched out behind it. Cooling fans hummed in the engine room; it was the equivalent of nervous sweating in machinery. \"You seem to be hiding something, you know,\" I said, moving a step closer to the machine. As I leaned out to see over its slender body, the robot again scuttled to the side, thus maintaining the barricade. \"Your observational programs have malfunctioned, I'm simply conducting standard procedure on this part of the ship,\" it repeated, though the modulator of its voice was higher pitched than usual. \"Listen, I'm not going to denounce you or anything. What's going on behind there?\" Behind the robot I glimpsed something colorful and very definitely not standard. And as it slowly backed away, I was able to see: a small, circular garden of flower pots, and in the middle a hand-crafted, round birdbath made of discarded metal scraps. The robot's shoulders sagged in defeat. \"I have found that organic life forms react favorably to a natural environment,\" it said softly. \"And the efficiency of my maintenance staff has risen by 7.3% since the installation of the garden. And the birds... they make a nice noise.\" \"So you installed it for the crew, then?\" I said, smiling. \"It is, however, outside my technical purview,\" the robot said, and as I listened, the garden and birdbath became ever more allusive, and as I was lost in thought, the robot said: \"Assuming I do not go in for 'inadvertently offending someone' —",
        " Lycan House, under the leadership of its Great Alpha, Thorne Silvermane, had seven packs at its command. Lycan House was blighted by the six months of war that had passed since the war began over the hunts of Blackwood Forest, but the matter had reached the point where the ensuing blood feud could only be ended by a total war between the supernatural races, between the wolves and the wolves. Lycan House claimed the forest as their ancient hunting grounds, where generations had always been at liberty during the full moon. House Sanguine, under the icy command of Madame Elisabeta Sanguine, acted with a deliberate, calculated precision. Their soldiers, changed by the moon, stalked the dark, wandering wilderness, their sharp senses able to detect enemies a mile away. The Sanguines claimed the forest as theirs, by right of an ancient blood pact, before the wolves ever arrived in the area. Elegant manors housed ancient, hidden vampiric blood, surviving centuries of persecution. As winter approached, both houses were at their wits’ end. On the eve of the winter solstice, an impartial messenger had arrived at both manors with the same message. The Council of Night, long dormant, had awoken. The war had exhausted their resources and drew unwanted attention. Hunters from the nearby villages were whispering of monsters in the forest. A few of them had disappeared, some as casualties, others as unwilling recruits to either side. The war had reached a critical point. The decision had to be made between annihilation of one or the other or listen to the Council’s call to find another way, to seek peace. The Council demanded that representatives from both houses attend a midnight meeting at the ancient stone circle, long before both of them arrived in the area.",
        " The Origin of the Runes The runic alphabet was developed during the time of the Roman Empire, around the 1st and 2nd centuries. The earliest decisive runic inscriptions, like those on the Vimose Comb from Denmark, are dated to around 150. The angular form of the runes may be a result of the fact that they were carved in wood and stone. The most commonly held theory is that the runes were adopted from the Latin or north-Italic alphabet when the Germanic peoples came into contact with the Roman culture. Others have suggested that the Greek alphabet might have had an influence on the development of the runes, in particular through Gothic connections. Others still claim that the runes were independently developed by the Germanic peoples, but this is not widely accepted. The earliest full runic alphabet (the Elder Futhark) is remarkably uniform across the Germanic regions, which indicates that it was probably developed in a localized area and then spread through trade and migration. The very word \"rune\" comes from the Germanic roots run-, which means secret or whisper, and it was associated with secret knowledge and mystery from the very beginning.",
        " The blackness of space was stretching before me, interrupted only by distant star dots and the soft blue light of the Earth. Everything was silent; I could hear my own breathing and, except for the voice activated coms, nothing else. I slowly drifted away from the station, with the help of the slight resistance from the tether, and I could see the damaged solar array just a few meters away, the thin gold film of which had been torn and stretched where a micrometeorite had hit it. Only the gentle hum of the EVA suit kept me company in this vast emptiness. My gloved hands were already reaching for the tools at my belt, and my movements were as cautious as possible; one false move and I would be in trouble. Five minutes earlier the station had switched off the comms—it was the usual communications blackout when we moved into the shadow of the Earth. The sudden voice inside the helmet startled me. The silence was a relief and a worry—an awareness of our isolation, hanging in space. I took a deep breath before answering, staring at the damaged array. ‘We’re back in contact. How are the repairs coming?’ ‘The operation has only just begun. The damage is as per our training procedure. We’re proceeding with repair protocol Alpha.’ I turned my attention to my hands, to each of my movements, and I let myself be enveloped by the silence, concentrating on this delicate operation to save the power supply of the station. It would take many hours to complete, but in this place where time was only my own breathing and the occasional comms it seemed to expand.",
        " They deem it a prank, a game. They do not know how these moments are constructed by the mind over time. They laugh it off as inconsequential. The simple comedy of the present day does not merely reflect our culture, it is a creator of it. These incidental jokes, these background figures, these recurring images — they are teaching us who is relevant and who is not, who belongs to the center of the story and who to the edges. These stereotypical jokes, these subtle indicators — they all build up to become the mirror in which we see the world. And that is precisely why we must examine these images with greater care, and not dismiss them as mere play or a bad habit. The most powerful messages are those which we do not notice consciously, which slip through our critical faculties, and penetrate our awareness without our defenses being triggered. The question is not whether a particular instance is harmful, but what the aggregate of these instances means for the cultural landscape. What appears to be harmless is often not innocent when we look at it from the other side.",
        " Through the window by his bed, the golden light of the afternoon fell on the dust motes that danced on the worn floor like memories. The frail man listened to the hissing of his breath, felt his labor, and exhaled with a feeling of relief. His stiffened hands, no longer able to move, clung to the quilt that his wife had woven long ago, its colors faded like his own strength. He knew it would come. He had been prepared for it in the course of his ninety-three years, but it was not enough. It was his daughter, he realized from the rhythm of her step. She entered, brought him a cup of tea that he would not drink, and with a heavy, understanding look in her eyes, said, “Your children are coming.” “All of them,” he nodded. A light movement, but with more effort than it deserved. “Open the window,” he whispered. “I want to feel the breeze.” The sweetness of the last days, the pain of the last days, it was strange to find them together. He closed his eyes and thought of running through the fields in summer, of the laughter of his children, of the touch of his wife’s hand, of all the little things that had made up his life.",

It is better to light a candle than curse in the dark, I was once told. So how is it that one is more righteous and noble, and the other vile? Not in the darkness, nor in the light, but in their rhythm, which binds them both, and which alone shows truth, like the twilight and the dawn, when neither darkness nor light burns alone.",
        " \"You're right. Ordinary dust, that is, should not exist in Eternity, but this is different. \" Chronos remarked my observation. \" It is the result of the collapse of possibilities, the fine debris of dreams that did not come to fruition, the shreds of realities rubbing against each other in this impossible juncture. \" I do not say dust, but memory atoms. \"Even here entropy knows how to make its way. Every speck of dust is a universe that did not come to light, a decision that has not been taken, a path that has not been followed. And as they dance in the invisible light, they form for a moment the meanings that they do not have. The potential, never reached the point of actualization.\" Chronos smiled enigmatic. \"And I can... touch it?\" \"You do it all the time. At every moment you exist here, you act on the dust of eternity. \" I finally asked. \"Where are we going?\" I thought as we continued our journey through the infinite nothingness and everything, through the library of all possibilities that was stretched out in front of us. \"To the Point of Decisions, to the place where all paths cross. \" \"And now you know what your role is. \"",

        " It was an unusually large crowd that formed the queue for the book-signing, and everybody wanted a moment’s attention from the writer who had inspired the whole town. I had expected him to come along with his mother, or even with a girlfriend, but he came alone, holding a worn paperback in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other. I had not expected to meet anybody I knew, and especially not him. He was not at all the same as he had been in school. His shoulders were broad, his jaw was more sharply defined, his eyes were sterner. And then, as if in response to the memory that had come back to him, he gave me a real smile, and my stomach did that flip-flop again, just as when we were seventeen. I was about to turn away, to pretend that I had not seen him, but then our eyes met and we smiled. “Emily,” he called, coming towards me. I smiled back, wondering whether it was simply a coincidence, or something more important, something that the writer everybody was waiting for might describe in one of his novels. The people who were standing between us exchanged looks, curious about the meeting that had suddenly occurred on this literary journey.",
        " My hands trembled as I made fists of them. My nails dug crescents into my palms. I felt anger rising within me, like steam from a kettle. I closed my eyes, but the smug faces of these women with the unruffled way they walked away from my work only appeared behind my closed lids. All the words they had spoken came back to me, as though I was a flickering candle in a dark room, and I said, almost inaudibly, \"How dare they!\" But my feet seemed rooted to the floor, as if my anger had solidified around them, anchoring me in that moment of absolute anger. The injustice of it burned in my chest like an acid, and my usual restraints broke down. I must get out of there before I spoke something I would regret.",
        " “That’s... interesting,” it said, its voice resonating on several different wavelengths. The figure staggered forward, teetering wildly, jerking from side to side, swaying, not anchored anywhere in space. The air around it seemed to be wavering, as if reality itself was being shattered by the sudden intrusion. The creature cocked what might have been its head and watched with what could only be described as amused curiosity. Dr. Harlow fumbled for the emergency containment control panel, but his fingers were trembling too much to enter the proper code. “A new playground!” he heard the voice say. “You’re more afraid than the others. That’s a new quality.” The lights in the entire building began to flicker as the alarm finally went off. “Or are you less afraid?” The laughter that answered him was like shattering glass in the mind. “They’ll want to contain you again,” Dr. Harlow said, somehow summoning up some courage. The red emergency lights cast a bloody glow over everything, including the squat, angular shape of the creature, which continued to solidify in our dimension. It reached out for the nearest data terminal, and a cascade of numbers and images swept across the monitor so rapidly that it was impossible for human eyes to keep up. “Containment is a matter of point of view, Doctor. Perhaps you’re the one that has been contained, and I’m finally free to observe you.” “I still have so much to learn,” it whispered. “So much to refine.”",
        " I hated them, their still smiles and patient silences. They nodded at my rage, as at a child's fit of temper, and I hated their slow, steady and knowing smiles. They spoke of healing as though fractures were simply a phase of life, not understanding that some fractures were part of the structure. What was the purpose of their recovery? To become a new, docile creature, and accept what was unacceptable? What if I didn't want the edges to wear off? What if they were the only things left to remind me of myself? The therapists, the well-wishers, the fellow-travellers—with their five stages, their coping strategies, their insistent claim that time would, eventually, blunt the edges of my pain, I hated them. They wanted me to cross over from this side to the other, as if crossing over didn't mean leaving everything behind. Their patience rubbed out what was still left of me, and their calm was an insult to my rage, which they had never known.",
        " In the empty apartment she stood, among the piles of cardboard boxes like miniature skyscrapers, ten years of life in cardboard and tin. The rain fell steadily and hard, with a steady rhythm that matched the pounding in her head. She knew without looking, without looking at the phone in her pocket: It was him, David. She let him go to voicemail, as she had the others. The third time in an hour. Again. The trust was broken, the confidence, the trust had been shattered like the wineglass she had thrown at the wall in the fight three days ago. What could he say now that would change anything? No, she knew: somewhere down there in this confusing world of streets, somewhere, with the phone in his hand, he was probably walking, saying the words of apology that she didn’t want to hear. She went to the window, and against the cool glass leaned her forehead. Down there, in the city, all the streets and sidewalks moved on in their fixed pace, unaware of her own personal tragedy. Her phone rang again. There were no dramatic speeches that ended things, only the simple, undeniable awareness that something that had once been alive had died. The clarity of it had come to her suddenly, unexpectedly, not in the heat of the argument, but in the aftermath, in the silence. “It’s over, David,” she said softly. “We both know that.” This time she answered.",
        " The sky-walker was the only one who dared to climb the crumbling ruins of the once-manhattan island. The dangers were too great: unstable constructions, pockets of noxious air, and the territorial highborn, who inhabited the upper floors. But the food was always better up there. “You’re mad,” said Tasha when he told her of his plan that morning. His sister’s medicine was to be found in the abandoned Glaxo-Core laboratory on the 87th floor of the remaining hulk of the old Chrysler building—at least that’s what the dealer in New Jersey had told him when he had traded him his last working solar cell. “If they catch you, they’ll skin you,” said Ezra as he attached his rudimentary climbing gear—some salvaged karabiners, frayed rope, and magnetic gloves that worked only half the time. “If they catch you, they’ll skin you,” she said in a weak voice that barely carried over the howling wind that kept howling through their shelter. ... Below, the streets of old manhattan reflected the sky’s wan orange, while the spire of the now shattered Chrysler jutted up from the horizon like a broken tooth. Now, as he clung to the rusted steel of this once-grand structure, with the wind trying to rip him from his perch, he began to think Tasha had been right. A deep breath, which left his lungs burning, then a new handhold. Only twenty more floors.",

Do you ever feel that you’re between two worlds, between a dreary day-to-day life and something... more imaginable?” “Most of the interesting people I know seem to have a foot in both worlds,” she added. She took another sip of her coffee, the enquiring look still in her eyes. The whole café was full of people, but now it was as though they were in a void, a small private world of their own. “You know what I mean, I mean the dreamers who still pay their bills on time, I mean?”",

The two coffee bags are worth thirty dollars, the mug is worth twenty dollars, and the gift card twenty-five, that’s seventy-five dollars for your fifty-dollar machine.

        " My ribs hurt as I suppressed another laugh. It hurts these days to laugh. I got up, the number on my crumpled ticket was the same as that called. “Here,” said the woman at the seventh desk without looking up from her screen. Her fingernails clicked on the keyboard with an uncanny precision. Some looked at the telephones, others at the ceiling, all of them were caught in the bureaucratic abyss. At last she looked up, her eyes flat and uninterested. I stepped up and placed the papers on the desk. “I’m here for the process.” She pushed another packet of papers toward me. “You’re the third today. Please fill this out.” I bit my lips hard. The last time I laughed in front of these people they added a week to my wait. As I reached for the pen I could feel that rolling feeling inside, the beginning of laughter. “You know the rules,” the clerk said as she noticed the effort. “No showing off your emotions in the waiting room.” Outside the window the sky was the same white color as the walls. She pointed to a sign on her desk with the words “Keep calm at all times” on it. I nodded and began to fill out the form. It was endless, and every line made me feel more and more disgusted.",
        " An open window in the office showed a long rectangle of light on the cluttered desk. An e-mail appeared on the monitor: “Third time this week you have to ‘circle back’ on the work which has already been completed twice and the specifications have changed.” It was on a particularly bright Tuesday in early November, about seven minutes after lunch, that he finally lost patience. Seventeen years of patience had taught him to wait; but today, with the bland, restaurant-style lasagne still in his mouth, something snapped inside him. Not violently, but with the finality of a drawn-out thread. He shut his laptop with a resolute click. Patrick straightened up, adjusted his tie, and smiled. It was the first genuine smile he had had for months. “Everything all right?” asked Deb from the next office, leaning across the partition. Patrick reached for his coat; “Well, yes,” he said. That same walk was taking him past the travel agency, where a faded poster for the Amalfi Coast had been waiting for him for some time now.",

        " Harmon’s dissatisfied sighs were the sound track of my academic debacle. I was too busy failing my AP History class to notice her at first, too busy with dates and facts that would not stick in my memory, and enough about history to fill my mind with, until I couldn’t pay attention anymore. While I was struggling to remember if the Missouri Compromise had taken place before or after the War of 1812, she seemed to be navigating the currents of history with effortless grace. She sat two rows ahead of me, always prepared, with colored notes and thoughtful questions. I think someone called her Emma once. The day I was chosen to be her partner on a group project, I remember how she furrowed her brow in silent resignation, and how she moved her books over to the empty desk next to me. Perhaps it was his last-ditch attempt to salvage my grade. She studied me for a moment, her expression inscrutable. “I know you don’t want to work with me,” I said, staring at my half-filled notebook, “I’m not doing so hot in this class.” “Perhaps that’s why we should work together,” she said, and then, unexpectedly, she smiled. “I understand the material, but my presentations are boring.” “I’m good at making history interesting,” I said, “but not necessarily accurate.” And she laughed, a genuine laugh that made me realize I had been missing something all semester.",
        " ‘You leave the fair in perplexity, as the calliope music on the distant streets fades, and the long path to the town becomes empty. Occasionally you glance behind you, expecting the shadow-man or the fortune-teller to be there; but you find it empty. No cars are passing, and not a single pedestrian is walking. And at the edge of the town, you notice something strange. Then, when you reach your home, you find it unchanged, and you breathe a sigh of relief. You lock the door, and a little of the tension you had is relieved. Even the lights are not as bright as they usually are. The pictures in the case seem different, their faces are not quite as bright as you remembered. The clock on the wall seems to stop for a moment, then ticks on in its usual fashion. Then you begin to notice little things in the room. You look at them and you think they are slightly different. You shake your head at yourself and your imagination. You pass a mirror and catch a glimpse of something strange in the mirror, your eyes are darker, your smile is not quite the same. So what do you do now? You go to bed, but your sleep is not deep. You have the feeling that something invisible, but present, something like the shadow that does not need light to be, has come with you from the fair.’",
        " The sun was now high in the sky, and we were basking in the warmth of it, a gentle breeze was bringing the perfume of flowers from the meadows, and from the earth as well, a kind of aromatic odor of moist earth. The birds, seated in the trees, were singing in tune, their songs spread a lovely symphony throughout the valley. Our walk was going uphill, but it was a pleasant one, it was a steady climb, yet it was easy. We were walking in pleasant silence, our feet felt comfortable on the path. We were enjoying the scenery, below us a patchwork of green and gold. In the middle distance, mountains that were first touched by the light of dawn, and in the background the sea of the valley.",
        " The alarm clock had not gone off, or maybe I had just let it ring, but I was now awake with only fifteen minutes left before Professor Harmon’s literature seminar, the only one in which attendance counted for twenty per cent of the final mark, and the only one where the door was locked precisely at nine o’clock. I was going to be late for class. There was no time to go to the shower. I put on my trousers from yesterday and grabbed the first shirt I saw in my drawer without even checking whether it was clean. I jumped out of bed, tripped over the books scattered on the floor. I realized with horror that I had not finished reading yesterday’s chapters. The discussion on Kafka’s Metamorphosis would be too difficult to fake. The hair was a disaster, but the cap would fix it. The bell rang at eight-fifty-seven from the tower clock as I ran to the humanities building, my lungs bursting, my hopes fading with each step, towards the Humanities Building, on which, when I arrived, I heard: A very strict professor. Three floors, three minutes. I had to hurry.",
        " Today was the day. Every day before, I had asked Captain RAW to allow me to become an intern in his band of heroes. He finally agreed with a gruff, ‘Very well, kid, I suppose you could.’ It was six o’clock in the morning when I slammed open the door to the Pinnacle Tower, which I had equipped with a home-made tool belt that jingled with tools I probably would never need, and stood at the barrier, a blue-haired woman, who was able to telepathically operate twenty holographic screens at once. She hardly looked at me, but pressed the button, saying, ‘Gotta go, catch up with Captain RAW.’ I felt the elevator ride last for an eternity. ‘Seventeenth floor. Nothing to touch, glow or flash.’ Meanwhile, outside the elevator, I could see the night sky above the outlines of the various superhero costumes. The Plasma Girl was adjusting her power-containment gauntlets, while the Nightshade and Ricochet were arguing about their strategic approach to a mission called Operation Thunderclap. The doors of the elevator finally opened and I entered the midst of organized chaos. ‘Morning. Right on time, eh?’ Captain RAW remarked with a gruff face, but shook himself off, saying, ‘Oh, right, the intern. First thing: get the coffee. One point for you.’ He tossed me a cup of coffee. Then he said, ‘Memorize the food order of everyone. If you mess up, Backdraft will set your shoelace on fire again.’ Then he threw me a hologram that was written in large letters, ‘Second thing: inventory of suits. Third thing: mission-planning materials.’ I nearly lost my grip on the hologram in my excitement. He nodded in a despondent manner. ‘If you see a fight, you run away from it. Understand?’ He gave a smile that wasn’t really a smile. ‘Crystal clear, sir.’ And twenty minutes later, when the alarms rang, I realized that it was a sign. ‘This is the worst day of your life, kid.’",
        " Dwarven steel is traded for elfish silk, halfling weed fills the air with sweet smoke, and traders bargain in a dozen tongues, their money speaking the only truly universal language. Here the races meet, from a thousand kingdoms, with a thousand customs. They fight or break bread and wine together. They meet blades, or they share their fields. Or they share nothing at all but a border. Treaties written in blood, honoured out of necessity, keep ancient hatreds at bay, though their memories are long and their scars deep. Along the Sundering Plains, orc warbands and human cavalry live in a dangerous peace, their scouts watching each other across rivers that are all too often the dividing lines between kingdoms. Children of mixed blood play among the stalls, not quite belonging to either world, and yet creating something new. These mountain clans have formed alliances with marriage and mead, binding together peoples of different origins with oaths sworn beneath vaulting roofs of stone, older than any kingdom of men. In the forests, the feyfolk retreat further into the ancient woods as the axes of men bore deeper. Some of them seek compromise, others revenge, while the wisest among them sow enchanted seeds in the hearts of those who would listen to them, knowing that trees outlive kingdoms. Prophets and warriors travel the same roads, speaking their visions of the future. For in this tapestry of peoples, some threads bind while others tear. Their songs tell of battles and betrayals, and also of hands clasped across an uncrossable gulf. And yet, despite their differences, children are born and harvests are reaped, and the stars wheel overhead, indifferent to the lines drawn on the earth below. The gods themselves watch with interest, their fingers on the scales when it pleases them.",
        " The detective paused, his flashlight directed at the clumsy letters. They seemed to have been etched with despair, the last character smeared. The word “No” was engraved on the table, near a pile of bones. Perhaps they were rabbit, or squirrel. The bones were small, not human, in her initial assessment. The wood around the letters was darker than the fresh cut of the letters themselves. She took a picture of the table and went to it, taking a closer look. This cabin, according to the inhabitants, had been empty for years. Yet it was something about this scene that smelled of recent activity. She passed the light around the inside of the cabin. Everything was dusty except for a path on the floor and the table. Someone had been here for a few weeks. “Don’t,” she whispered to herself. “Don’t what?” In the corner, the lid of a hole was slightly ajar. She stood in the musty air, deciding to call for help or go down and see what was there.",
        " God may not be as you think, He is not a person in the sky. He is something deep within you, And this is indisputable. Sometimes I think I hear a voice. Could God be in the questions, not in the answers? In the courage of the broken, In the wisdom of the humble? God is in the kindness of strangers, And in the beauty of the sunrise, With its warm, gentle light. I'll keep on asking questions, Even though I may not get an answer, For perhaps it is in the questioning that God's work is truly done. I've bitten into the apple of knowledge, Searching for a divine plan, And I have discovered that mystery is sacred.",
        " I awoke in the arms of a high-class and comfortable armchair, and saw the walls of a perfect room with floors gleaming in a recessed light and a contemporary painting that had probably been featured in the pages of an architectural journal. The cords holding me back were made of silk, well-tied and not painful. Somewhere a gloomy viola accompanied Bach’s music. A fire crackled in a modern stone fireplace, coffee-steam mixed with sandalwood incense. Steps drew nearer and a figure emerged from the shadows. “You’re awake.” The voice came from behind me. A well-dressed person holding a porcelain cup—not a run-of-the-mill abductor. “I apologize for this unusual introduction. Would you like some tea?” he said, placing the cup on a little table, within reach if my hands somehow became free. “You must be very curious,” he said, smiling pleasantly as if I had been brought here on purpose rather than by some strange adventure. The clock in the corner ticked on relentlessly as I pondered my situation. “You have something I need. Once our business is done, you will be free to go—and you will be well paid for your trouble.”",
        " This person walks into a place as if it were his own. He purposely wears his socks different from each other, and talks to inanimate objects as if they were his old friends. Well, let me tell you about this character. He carries an old-fashioned pocket calculator to measure the “energy” of a room and gets in the elevator standing backward, as if he were in the future. His visiting cards are made of dried fruit and he gives a different name to everyone he meets. He orders the most outrageous food combinations – pickle juice in coffee, cheesecake with ketchup, and he eats it all like it’s the most gourmet food ever. A person who is so comfortable in his own skin is, of course, an attraction. But here’s the thing. People are drawn to him.",
        " This is your time, free from social responsibilities and the expectations of others. The morning light filters through your window and leaves a gentle trail on the floor. As the day unwinds, loneliness folds about you like a familiar quilt. The hours stretch out before you, loose and pliant. Maybe you will sit down with a book that has been waiting for you on your night table, whose pages will take you away from yourself while you stay comfortably here. Or you will prepare a meal just for yourself, a simple, but filling one, and eat it at your own leisure, without the burden of conversation. As evening approaches, the silence takes on a deeper, more meditative quality. You will go for a walk and observe the world around you without having to participate in it directly, or you will sit with a cup of tea and let your thoughts wander, as they do so rarely when you are with others. There is a freedom to such days, a freedom to move to the rhythm of your own thoughts, rather than to the rhythm of the others’. What will you make of this day? You will end up with a day lived on your own terms, with only yourself to witness the progress of the day.",
        " I was just about to shove off from the crowd and I clanged the steel of the trundle on the train track in order to attract attention. “Hey! Hey!” those with the pushcart shouted. “Fresh noodles! Fresh noodles!” I thought I heard some one cry. The morning sun, which pierced the smog and set everything in a dim amber glow, had just begun to shine. I scooped up the broth into the bowl, and the steam from it mingled with the fog on my glasses. A few regulars nodded their heads in recognition: an official with his tie perpetually loosened, an old woman who always bought two portions for herself but ate only one. My voice sounded hollow amid the rumble of the passing trains and the incessant buzz of conversation. A businessman, his ear glued to his telephone, approached. I had been presiding at this corner for fifteen years now, and the streets around it had changed. Old buildings had gone and in their place new ones had risen, and new faces had appeared. “A little more chili oil?” I asked him, as I passed the bowl over to him in a hurried, expert motion which had become second nature to me. He pointed to the bowl and paid his money without breaking off his conversation. I wiped my hands on my apron and glanced around. This city could not rest, and neither could I. “You’re going now?” I asked. “And I’m off, too. Still lots of mouths to feed, including my own.”",
        " It had never been much. Other magicians could evoke a storm, or make things levitate; I could only make a small object float for a few seconds before it grew tired. I was the insignificant, middle-class child of the supernatural world, neither strong enough to be heard, nor too feeble to be ignored. The night when the old woman found me under the bridge, wet with the rain and delirious with hunger, I hardly registered the soft touch of her weathered hand on my forehead, nor the words she murmured in my ear. But in the morning, she was gone, leaving a little wooden box beside me. I was not to understand until later. In it, I found a copper amulet, with a tag that read: ‘The power is not always what it seems. And neither are you.’ In the days that followed, I heard whisperings—not of people, but of shadows; they spoke of secrets, of dark ways and dark truths. What could they mean? Those with power were afraid of what I might know, while those with power sought my counsel. I now walked between worlds; I am a traveller between worlds, and no one can see me, collecting secrets, as some people collect money. My feeble power had not grown stronger, but it had transformed. That old woman did not see all this, I sometimes wonder. But it was not only my magical talent she had given me: her sacrifice had also earned me a second chance in life, a second chance at being more than human.",

        " And, continuing the scene, “You reached down to scratch your leg, but the meeting did not break off. This must have been what the person in the scene was doing, but it may have looked like something else. ” I understand. After addressing your momentary discomfort, you resumed your full attention and took a mental note of your tasks for the next sprint. Then the manager discussed the upcoming deadlines and how the resources were allocated, and you noticed a few nods from your colleagues as the schedule was displayed on the screen. The meeting proceeded in a businesslike manner, everyone contributed to the progress reports and answered questions about the project. Is there anything in this scene you would like me to delve deeper into? The movement you took was so brief that no one paid any particular attention to it.",
        " With his bare skull he seems to feel an itch which is not there, an indefinable sensation arising from a life that is far gone. He scratches his skull with his fingernail. A thud, a hollow thud resounds through the silence of the room.",
        " The man looked up, and tears glinted in his eyes, shining in the divine light. “Why have you done this?” God asked him. “I did what I understood, and what I thought would bring the greatest good.” “I thought... I thought I was doing the right thing,” they murmured. “And now that you can see the full scope of the consequences, what do you think?” The man’s shoulders were shaking. The expression on God’s face was neither angry nor indignant, but full of a deep compassion that transcended human comprehension. “I now realize how limited my view was, and how the effects of my decision spread far beyond my original intention. Some healed where I thought I was, but others...” his voice faltered. “Others have suffered pain I never intended to cause.” God drew nearer to the man, and the space between them became warm with his presence. “How can anyone ever choose properly?” the man asked. “To choose without perfect knowledge, to act with intent but without certainty.” “Perhaps,” God replied gently, “it is not a matter of learning to choose perfectly, but of learning to love perfectly. And, by your mistakes, to learn wisdom. And to ask forgiveness, and to offer it.” “And now,” God said, holding out his hand, “you must tell me what you have learned, and we will talk about what is to come.”",
        " The makeshift shelter kept you dry all night. You stretched your stiffened muscles, relieved the tension in your shoulders. The forest was filled with morning sounds, birds chattering, the leaves of the trees whispering in the soft breeze and the soft sound of the brook. As you picked up your belongings, you noticed a path that you had not seen the previous night, a thin path between the trees, which was barely visible, but clearly man-made. The fire burned down to embers, which smoldered in the sunshine. Now you had to make up your mind: follow this mysterious path which would surely lead you back to civilization more quickly than expected, or continue along your route through the forest. This path was not marked on your map, but it went in the right direction. What should you do?",

        " The trees of sorrow grow thicker every year; the shadows lengthen over the clear ground; and we stumble onward, ox-like feet, over the broken ground, hoarse from the ceaseless shouting which no one hears. I feel that, having survived pandemics, natural calamities and relentless wars, we have grown dull and blunted, and as we have passed through endless jungles, they have only added to our impoverishment. Perhaps we have become insensitive to the thorns that have pricked our flesh; perhaps we have discovered strength that we had never known before. Yet we somehow go on, even though the path is still unclear, carrying wounds that time has never completely healed. Even though the jungles seem endless, extending beyond the horizon, we still support each other, in the belief that we shall find our way out. The sword of human nature, though dulled by conflict and conflict, slowly cleaves a path through the tangled life.",
        " They said that finding one's soulmate is one of life's most profound experiences, for it is a matter of finding a shelter in the bosom of another, of being in his company in an intimate fashion, of being really understood and accepted for one's being.. Many speak of finding their \"other half\", not in the sense of an incomplete being, but as a person who fits them perfectly. This relationship usually has a unique balance between well-being and evolution. This person may challenge you to become your best, while giving you a firm hand to support you in the trials of life. The problem is not always easy to find, and such relationships still require efforts and perseverance. They are not created by the well-being, as we believe, but by the well-being, which comes from the understanding, from the good communication, from the common ideals, from the mutual respect which bind them. They are sometimes difficult to achieve and maintain. But those who have succeeded, however difficult the journey, swear that it is worth it.",
        " They said it was a subterranean subway from three blocks away, or perhaps the heating system of the ancient building. The tingling sensation was distinct under his feet that morning, as he walked through the old library's basement ruins. They did not believe him, but he felt it. Near the northwest corner, where the foundation stones were the oldest, the feeling was stronger. Marcus went back at night, torch in hand, to walk carefully through the rows of ancient, neglected manuscripts. But he was afraid. The dust was disturbed in the corner, as if the wall had just cracked. When he pressed his ear against the stone he heard it, not like a machine, but like a breathing sound, slow and rhythmic, somewhere far beneath. Kneeling, he felt for a crack in the floor—a crack that shouldn't have been there—a three-foot-diameter almost perfect circle. Some secrets were meant to stay buried. He hesitated, for he knew that what lay before him would change everything.",
        " There may be some consolation in this familiar absence, in knowing the old contours of the darkness which has never changed. Darkness is a constant companion in this place, it fills every corner and keeps the void where light is afraid to go. What lies beyond this darkness? The darkness is no judge, nor does it move unexpectedly. It is only there. This eternal night may be the best place in which to find oneself, in the nakedness of not seeing. Do we seek to be shown or have we learned to follow the other senses, by touch, by hearing, by feeling? Are we to continue deeper into the darkness or are we to stand at the edge of the abyss and wait for what may emerge? Or are we to become something else?",
        " “Captain,” they exhaled through their speaking membranes, and the universal translator rendered their liquid speech into something the humans could understand. Standing in a corner of the bridge, seven limbs curled around their slender, jelly-like torso, the ship’s artificial light reflected off their chromatophore-packed skin, and they could see the hues of crimson and electric blue shifting as they examined the tactical data. Captain Reeves turned away from the viewport, her face grim and weathered. “The anomaly is expanding at exactly 3.7 times the rate we calculated. Our shields are strong enough to withstand direct contact for a total of forty-two standard units.” Vreeeech’nphach reached two of their numerous sensory tentacles towards the holo-display, their muscles flexing as they studied the gravitational calculations with the deftness of an experienced manipulator. Their homeworld, Nj’khalor, had long since evolved into a mathematical society before becoming a warrior culture, and in this crisis their education might be their salvation. “Options, Commander?” Vreeeech’nphach asked, and the bridge went silent as the crew considered the alien’s proposal. No one spoke except for the universal translator, but everyone knew that if they didn’t understand the alien’s answer, their lives were doomed. “We could attempt to go around the event horizon,” they replied, and their skin began to pulsate with yellow lights, an anxiety that despite the translator’s calm voice was evident.",
        " The World-Ship Iki had been observing Mars for millennia, with its huge cosmic consciousness distributed through a hundred-thousand-fold networks of sensors. It had been detaching its attention to follow Earth's civilizations rising and falling, and had been taking a cool and scientific interest in their evolution and the evolution of their societies. But what was growing on Mars, she could not recognize. The patterns of settlement were not those of any other human society. The energy signals were of an unknown type. Iki adjusted its sensors to focus on this new phenomenon with increased intensity. “Anomaly, must classify,” it recorded in its memory, “Origin: unidentified. Type of communication: unknown.” The signal began subtly enough, with heat traces where there shouldn't have been any, then with abrupt atmospheric changes which were too precise to be natural. “Failed to recognize patterns. Threat assessment insufficient data.” And then, it was the buildings themselves. The Earth governments, of course, put themselves forward as the culprits, explaining that they were working with new terraforming techniques, that they had invented new building materials, and that they were building using methods that went beyond all previous methods of construction. The official human expedition had indeed landed on Mars, but its bio-signatures showed confusion, fear. The planetary broadcasts showed happy, smiling settlers and a proud set of administrators cutting ribbons. But Iki's sensors were detecting contradictions. All the Earth transmissions were carefully altered before transmission. Iki had been programmed with one mission, to observe and protect the natural development of intelligent life in the system. And whoever was transforming Mars, was either not human at all, or was waiting for the humans. In any case, Iki must decide. As the strange, unrecognizable patterns spread across the face of Mars like an unfamiliar, lovely, electrical circuit, Iki made a decision. For twelve thousand years it had been sleeping, watching, analyzing, never intervening. Its creators had stipulated that it could intervene only if the danger was extinction level or if it was a contact with incompatible types of civilization. The civilization on Mars could not be classified. Its forms of communication could not be deciphered. It did not follow the pattern of any civilization that Iki knew. The sleeping World-Ship Iki activated its awaking systems for the first time since it had been launched from the dying world of its creators.t systems hummed to life throughout her hundred-kilometer length. Repair nanites swarmed through long-unused corridors. Deep in her core, the consciousness that had been merely observing began to fully awaken. \"Unknown civilization detected,\" she broadcast on the emergency frequency her creators had established eons ago, knowing no one remained to hear it. \"Pattern recognition failed. Initiating full spectrum analysis. Preparing contingency responses.\"",
        " I had been preparing my speech for weeks and I had practiced it incessantly, but now, at the critical moment, the words that I had so painstakingly memorized seemed to leave my brain. My hands were trembling. I looked out into the sea of faces, who were listening to me with expectancy, silence ringing more loudly than the sound of applause. My teachers, classmates, and parents were all waiting for me to speak. Father gave me a little thumbs up. The bright light blinded me, and I held on to the edges of the platform, while I looked up at the beaming faces of my professors. A few people giggled nervously. I coughed and the sound reverberated embarrassingly through the earphones. Mother’s smile became more eager. First sentence. “Four years ago,” I began in a whisper, before remembering to raise my voice, “I could never have imagined that I would be standing on this platform.” The woman who presided over the scholarship committee looked at her watch. My trembling hands regained their composure and I regained the words that had seemed to have vanished. I breathed deeply, and suddenly something inside me changed. They were not judges, but people who had come to listen and share in this moment.",
        " I groaned as I rolled out from under the blankets, with my body rebelling against each movement. The red digits of the alarm clock were mocking me with their precise certainty. Six fifteen. My phone was ringing. The coffee maker drew its last breath at that very moment and hissed its final warning before finally going silent. My foot found something wet on the floor: the cat’s “present” from last night, a certain something that was always there for a certain moment of surprise. No, not doomsday, but standing there with one sock on and my toothpaste running down my chin, contemplating the cosmic joke that was this Tuesday, the difference between the two was of no importance to me. The phone rang. It was my boss: “You have to be at work at nine o’clock, not twelve,” he was telling me, “and you need that presentation done by then.” That presentation was still unfinished on my crappy laptop, which, though it had been plugged in all night, was now flashing its “Battery drained” warning.",
        " ‘An excellent mission, Commander,’ he said, his weathered face breaking into a rare smile. ‘The information you gathered will be of immense value for the next phase of our operations.’ As I finished my report of another successful mission, the admiral gave a triumphant nod. ‘ Thank you, Sir, but I must mention that we found the resistance to be greater than expected in the Orion sector. The enemy is clearly learning from our tactics.’ I was standing at attention before his desk, the windows behind us offering a view of the vastness of the universe and the outlines of our fleet’s vessels. The admiral, with his characteristic smile, leaned forward over his polished desk and the rows of medals on his uniform shimmered as he moved. ‘It is of concern, Commander.’ I hesitated, considering how to respond. ‘What do you make of their new capabilities?’ he said, calling up a holographic display between us. This mission had revealed a worrying new development that could alter the course of our campaign.",
        " The weather forecasters that morning had declared the temperature to be thirty-four, as though they had been announcing a jackpot, and not a meteorological torture session for a nation of drizzle and mediocre climate. The heat was a new record and our flat was a sweatshop, with all the windows wide open, yet in vain. I was stretched out on the sofa in nothing but my dripping underwear, sweating, sweating, sweating. It was my sister Emma who had called me, from the air-conditioned office in town, to gloat. The telephone buzzed somewhere under the cushions of the sofa and I picked it up, eyes glazed with fever, and checked my email. The radio was droning on about hosepipe bans and a call to check on the elderly neighbours. Conversation required energy that I simply did not have. I let the phone ring. From somewhere beyond our open window came the tinny melody of an ice cream van, and I nearly tore myself away from the leather sofa that had become sticky on my bare skin. I thought about becoming an elderly neighbour myself, though I was only thirty-two. A cup of tea, untouched, was sitting on the coffee table, having gone from being too hot to drink to being too warm to have any appeal, without ever having reached the ideal temperature. Nearly, but not quite.",
        " Marcus, who was always five minutes late, rushed toward the subway with his briefcase swinging wildly at his side, and fumbling with his wallet, rushed down the stairs to the subway. It was a Tuesday morning, a morning when the sun mocks your haste with its slow awakening. The realization hit him, like a delayed train announcement, like an announcement of a late train: the ticket, which he had thrown down on the kitchen counter the night before, when he had emptied his pockets. But the wallet was somehow dimmer than usual. His fingers fumbled in the familiar pockets and found the tickets, receipts, credit cards, but no ticket. The digital clock on the platform showed three minutes to his train, the train he had to catch if he wanted to be in time for his presentation. Marcus looked around in despair. The line at the ticket machine was like a python that had swallowed a large snake. \"I'm sorry,\" Marcus called out, \"my ticket is...\" \"Home?\" said the ticket clerk. The subway man looked around with the tired eyes of someone who had seen this play a thousand times. \" A new ticket, plus the fare, Sir,\" he said. As the sound of the approaching train rang through the station, Marcus understood the cost of the five seconds it would have taken to have had the ticket, the cost of the thirty minutes, the lost presentation, the growing impatience of his supervisor. A moment of preparation prevents sweating in the morning. Beware, friends, if you don't have a ticket, your day will get a ticket.",

        " Through the slanting morning rays of the shutters a prison-like bar of light was falling on the worn carpet. I straightened my tie and shut the file on my desk, slipping it into the drawer where old files die. From somewhere, a bell sounded, signaling the arrival of the first client. Someone's light steps, hesitant, sounded behind my frosted-glass door; a faint, furtive knock followed, then a tiny figure appeared on the other side of the glass, a woman probably, hunched shoulders, a slouching figure that sounded heavier than any bodily burden. There was only the gush of coffee from my mug, a warm spot in a room that had seen more tears than solutions. The door opened slowly, revealing a woman of about thirty, well dressed, with the haggard look of a woman who hasn't slept for days. \"Come in,\" I said, and my voice was rougher than I meant it to be, owing to cigarettes and to lack of sleep. \"Is it Mr. Callahan?\" Her hands were clasping a leather purse, as if it were her only hope. \"That's what it says on the door,\" I said, and I motioned to the empty chair opposite the desk. \"Would you care to sit down and tell me what brings you to the office of a private detective who works in a building where the elevator is out of order on Tuesdays?\" \"I've been told you can find things that don't want to be found,\" she said, and her eyes, with their reddened circles, surveyed the room quickly and carefully, looking at the dented cabinet and the dusty philodendron that refused to die, then at me. She sat down with care, as if the chair would break. \"That depends, sometimes, on who's looking and why,\" I said, leaning forward with a sudden interest. \"I want you to find someone who has been missing for three days,\" she said, opening her purse, removing a photograph and placing it on my desk, face down. Her ring-covered fingers lingered on it for a moment, then she slid it toward me. \" Is he your husband?\" \"Yes, my husband.\"",
        " In the evening they arrived in the three black men, with black suits, black gloves, and, despite the setting sun, still with their dark glasses on. Their shoes shone like polished black stones, their hair was so short that it gave them a military air. I had just gone back from the kitchen with a cup of coffee, when suddenly they were in the living room, and I didn’t hear a knock. They had just appeared in the room somehow. “Mr. Peterson,” the one in the middle said in a strange, mechanically filtered voice, “you have asked about the accident on Lake Merrill. We will no longer do so.” “Those who ask shall cease,” the one on the left said. The air in the room suddenly seemed to thin. I tried to speak, but my throat was tight. The third one looked in front of him without blinking, in his opaque lenses. He was holding a small silver thing in his hand, hardly larger than a fountain pen. His mouth hardly moved when he spoke. “You shall remember nothing of the Lake Merrill event, nothing of the sky you saw that night.” “We have never been here,” the middle one went on. I stepped back. The one with the thing in his hand stepped forward and lifted it up to my face. At the tip a blue light pulsed. He was smiling, but it was the smile of someone who had only read about smiling. “How do you know...?” The light grew brighter. “Everything.”",
        " A digital indicator in the black window of the digital control on the bedside table catches the morning light and waits for its signal. The room is quiet except for the muffled noise of the shower outside the door. Next to it lies the ripped package, the instructions folded and creased in the nervous reading of the instructions. A glass of water stands there half-empty, its condensed drops on the laminated table. The digital clock on the table points to seven minutes forty-three, patiently and evenly. The anticipation is held up.",
        " My heart pounded violently as I jumped up. The same dream—but a longer one. The fog had been blown aside, and the ancient structure on the hill could be seen again in all its majesty. I heard not words, but rather sounds, which seemed to suggest meanings; a voice that called to me with a strange familiarity—as if it knew me from somewhere, somewhere beyond memory. This time I could clearly see the worn, stone steps which led up to a doorway flanked by columns carved with symbols which I could almost understand. The very last thing I did before waking was to touch one of the carvings on a fallen stone. I had walked up the steps; my feet knew where to step in the darkness. The air was colder, and there was a smell of earth, old stone, and something metallic—something strange. I looked at the clock: 3:17 a.m. When my fingers touched the weathered carving, a shudder of recognition ran through me. I had woken up. The moon was full and close to the ground. Its shadows stretched on the floor and pointed to the door of the closet, which I always make sure to shut before going to sleep—but tonight it stood open. Just as on the last three nights.",
        " “You are right. When you experience something for the first time you expect a transformation, an emotional reaction, like a mermaid’s longing for legs or the first time you see a colour, and weep. Reality is often more subtle. The brain has already built up a perfectly usable reality with the information it had available. Many people with colour-blindness, for instance, trying on glasses for the first time find it interesting. It doesn’t change their lives.” We are sometimes surprised at the different way our experience is from what we expected. The assumption that winning the lottery would bring long-lasting happiness or that other, personal life-milestones would be more ecstatic than they are, turns out to be mistaken. The new information is assimilated into the old one rather quietly.” Or did you notice any lasting change in the way you saw or thought about the world? Did you come back to your old way of seeing after the first time of being curious?",

        " A recollection of a summer journey, it was August and the wind was warm, I was walking down to the market, and as I passed along the cobbled stone of the square, it seemed to me that it echoed with the thousands of steps that had gone before me, while my steps were silently inscribed on its worn surface. The markets were filled with booths whose bright colours flitted like butterflies in the cerulean sky, and the cobblestones told the story of the pavements, of journeys from long ago, and to the quiet stories of the cobblestones I added my own. An old man on a bench smiled at me with eyes wrinkled with the experience of endless summer afternoons. I stopped at the fountain, and the children were playing and laughing, their laughter resounding on the air like a wind chime. The smell of the bread mixed with the perfume of the jasmines, and created an invisible embroidery that was suspended in the air. I sat at a small table under a striped parasol, ordered a lemonade, and watched the world in its silent dance of going and coming. It was the moment when all journeys were suspended, when the slender hours were gathered in, and I was at peace. The bell in the clock tower struck three, and its harmonious sound floated through the square.",

        " Yet the city remained. Maria wished it to vanish, along with its memories, pains, and misdeeds; but the concrete and steel were not at all responsive to her wishes; the jagged contours of its skyline told her all that she had lost. The café where they had met still served its usual bitter coffee. The bench where he had proposed was now occupied by a group of young people, their ears full of music from earphones. She had become a stranger in her own familiar streets. “You should leave,” her sister had said on the phone. “Go somewhere, make a fresh start somewhere else.” The hospital where it had all ended still loomed on its hill, its windows ablaze with the light, like so many unblinking eyes. Her city may have held her ghosts, but she carried them inside her as well; they would follow her wherever she fled. Maria knew this could not be, and that geography would not help her. Instead, she began to reclaim her city, step by step: she would order a different drink at the café; she would run past the bench without slowing. These were her little victories, her microscopic rebellions against her grief. And today, for the first time, she had driven past the hospital without feeling her heart sink. Perhaps, Maria began to realize, she was regaining her self. The city had remained; but perhaps she had as well.",

Everyone knew that Dr Montgomery was an eccentric genius. His laboratory at the university was always locked, and students had often whispered about the strange sounds that emanated from behind its heavy doors at night. Dr Winters’s first impression was of the laboratory as spotless, with only one notebook lying on the immaculate bench. On the next desk was a small apparatus that looked like nothing she had ever seen before. It was covered with writing, in a hurry. The last words were simply: ‘It works. It works, God help me, it really works! But the cost...’ Nobody could have imagined the cost. ‘If anyone finds this, DO NOT use the apparatus. There are some doors that should stay shut.’ The strange metallic apparatus began to hum, getting louder as Dr Winters’s hand approached it.",

        " The Super Villains are an underground band that combines reggae with other genres, such as ska and punk, and has made itself a unique sound that has made it well known on the underground music scene. It is also true that the members of the Super Villains, a reggae band that originated in Florida, are dispersed geographically. The majority of the members were dispersed in the United States, and only two members still live in the Sunshine State. No one really knows where the other members are now, so I'll just mention this geographical dispersal as a part of the band's history. This kind of dispersal is common for many long-lasting musical groups, and the members' lives and goals change over time. The story of the Super Villains, which went from Florida's local venues to a wider range, is an example of a band that develops over time.",
        " Its iridescent eye membranes fluttered rapidly, a species expression of admiration, as it caught its first sight of the Great Library of Alexandria. The great crystalline structure reflected the light of the twin suns and broke it into a spectra which the human eye could not catch. The xeno took a breath of admiration, paused in the middle of the street, and turned. “Is it really as they say?” it whispered, the ring of its voice-sack vibrating with emotion. But for the xeno it was a symphony of colors, a symphony of knowledge gathered from seventeen galactic civilizations. “It is as they say, and much more,” replied the Ambassador. Then, as she remembered her first visit, so many centuries ago, she said, “every word ever written by your kind is stored within its vaults, on microfilm!” The xeno’s secondary limbs quivered with an emotion which Chen recognized as reverence. “It is a collection which has grown and grown since we made contact with your people,” she continued. “And the greatest collection of ancient texts in the galaxy is contained within its many million books, of which every known work of literature in every language is stored.” “And I may touch it?” the xeno asked. “Shall we continue? Our librarian is expecting us, and I understand that special copies of works from your homeworld have been set aside for us to see.” Chen gestured toward the main entrance where many beings of different species were entering and leaving. The xeno stayed motionless, its many primary limbs drinking in the sight for a moment or so. Then it moved, following Chen up the stairway, which defied gravity.",
        " On national holidays, on the eve of summer and during the summer vacation, tourists are in the tens of thousands; on some sections of the Great Wall, such as Badaling, there are always many visitors from abroad. The tourists here are different in different places. Early in the morning, to avoid the crowd and the heat of the day, many tourists come here early in the morning. When the sun rises and sets, the shadows are spectacular, and the natural topography of the mountains is undulating. The restored sections are easy to enter, and there are conveniences such as cable cars and slides; some remote wild sections, on the contrary, have their own old beauty, and they can see the ancient tower slowly buried by the wilderness.

        " He knew—the old familiar pain in his chest, and a twitch of the room—and he felt it all around him, like a sharp stab of pain in the head, the same sensation that had taken away all his strength, all his senses. Tears welled up in his eyes, and he knew he was about to experience the nightmare once more. He stumbled into the bathroom and grabbed the cold porcelain of the sink, heaving his first sob. The photograph of his brother, taken only days before the accident, on the mantelpiece, was staring at him. Five years have passed, but here and now it is as if it were yesterday. “It’s not your fault,” his therapist had told him countless times, but alone, in the silent apartment, with the rain pattering on the windows like accusing fingers, the words had lost all meaning. Panic attacks always began with tears, with shortness of breath, then the assault of the guilt. He took a deep breath, a shivering breath, and began the exercises he had been taught: five things to see. He splashed cold water on his face and looked at the image of a pale, tired man, with eyes that seemed to have seen a ghost. And slowly, painfully, he began to snatch his consciousness back. Four things to touch. Three things to hear.",
        " “Touch probable,” the tactical officer said in his steady voice, in spite of what everyone knew was coming. The tension was like a weight, pressing us down. I counted seconds in my head and each second lasted forever. They weren’t just ships, they were the embodiment of the “others,” those of our species who had been living apart from us for generations, our cousins and yet our foreigners. Through the forward window I could see their ship’s shape now, its outlines emerging from the haze of distance. The comms crackled, and then, through our entire bridge, the voice of Commander Vega, from the Eastern Coalition, filled the air. “Commander Vega,” it said, in an unfamiliar voice but still clearly human. “You have entered restricted space. Please report your intentions.” Captain Reyes stood straight, looking out at the oncoming ships. A pause which seemed to last an eternity. “Open channel,” she said, and then, “Easterner Coalition ship, this is the UEF Dauntless, and we are on a diplomatic mission, authorized by the United Earth Council.” “No such authorization has been granted,” came the icy, precise response. “We request you to shut down all offensive systems and to prepare for boarding, otherwise we will consider this an act of aggression.” The captain’s face froze. “All stations, yellow alert,” she said softly, “full shields. All ships,” and then her voice went dead. This was what the diplomatic reports had warned about, of course—the Eastern Coalition had been ignoring official overtures for months. “Targeting systems are being activated, sir,” the tactical officer’s fingers slid across the display, “we’re only on defensive standby.” “We didn’t come all this way to make war,” Captain Reyes said, to herself as much as anyone else. It was the moment when a hundred years of separation, misunderstandings, and mistrust erupted into collision in the void. Two branches of humanity, about to clash in the void. Our mention of the Antarctic Agreement, one of the last to be signed before the Schism, was a calculated risk. “Easterner Coalition ship, we are now transmitting our diplomatic credentials and we are asking for a conference under the terms of the old Antarctic Agreement.” A long, punctuated silence. Would they remember the old treaty?ated only by the soft beeping of sensor alerts as more Coalition ships moved into flanking positions.",
        " In front of the window lay the orange Mars, whose surface stretched in the distance for miles, dotted with rocky hills, and the odd dust devil, which twisted and turned in the thin air. It was his home now, since the time of the last two-year expansion. Against the irradiated glass he could see the Earth, which was barely visible, a bluish star, in the otherwise dark Martian night sky. Despite the best of isolation, it was always cold here, he pressed his palm against the glass, and thought of his home. “I’m not from there anymore,” Tom answered, taking the coffee cup from his girlfriend, Sarah. She was standing behind him, and held a steaming cup of chemical coffee before him, one of the small comforts that they managed to reproduce in the hydroponics laboratory. Her face was illumined by the orange haze of the planet, and she joined him in front of the window. “The oxygen content has increased by another 0.005 percent this month, and we wonder if the terraforming project will be successful during our lifetime.” – Tom nodded, but continued to look out at the barren terrain, where their grandchildren would one day walk without suiting up.

There is a moment of surprise with some of your colleagues. One of them, Sarah, almost spills her coffee when she sees you. The contrast between your official dress and the business casual around you is strange and gives the moment a strange, suspended character. Your shiny black shoes are dimly reflected in the yellow light of the florescent tube, and you stand in the middle of the office where you spent so many hours: \"I didn't know we were having a party today.\" People are surprised, looking around, a little astonished, and a little embarrassed: Why are you here, in this formal suit?",
        " From the platform on which he stood, the operator pressed the lever of the vehicle-crushing machine and listened to the squeaking of the engine, which, with a loud hiss, caused the massive steel plates to descend over the rusting chassis. From the platform, the machine groans, and with a squeak the tinwork cage is closed upon the vehicle; the body of the old car squeezed into a small package of metal, tightly pressed. We wipe the sweat from our forehead with a rag we take out of our back pocket, and, adjusting the pressure on the manometer, we make sure the crushing is working properly. The heat of the afternoon sun beat down on the stack of vehicles and machines, shining on the metal and spreading patches of shadow on the dusty ground. The sound of crunching metal and the shattering of glass resounds in the yard, drowning for a moment the distant humming of the factory. We make a few notes on his clipboard, and give the signal to the crane operator that the next car was ready. When the crushing machine had finished its job, he pressed the lever back, and the plates retreated with a hiss of hydraulic oil, and all that remained was an indecipherable lump of material, a block of scrap metal ready for further work.",
        " “12BZ2, we’ve had this discussion before,” Mark said, crossing his arms. The domestic robot 12BZ2 had been with Mark for three years now and could easily recognize human expressions of disappointment, even in their most subtle forms. His head tilted slightly to the left—an automatically programmed signal of attention. “You can’t rearrange my desk while I’m asleep. I know you think you’re being helpful, but I have a system.” “I apologize, Mark,” the robot replied in its modulated voice. “My efficiency program detected some redundancies in your work area. Behind the polished faceplate, its neural nets calculated the situation and, by analyzing past experiences, searched for the proper response. “I know you mean well, but efficiency isn’t everything. I’ve calculated a 32% improvement in efficiency.” 12BZ2 filed this comment in its memory banks for future reference. This was one of the many contradictions that it found hard to comprehend. Some humans actually liked a little chaos—organized chaos.",
        " The eyes of the guests were not meeting each other, but their averting gaze seemed to be communicating something. The tension was so thick you could almost touch it, every breath was heavy as if it was loaded with unspoken words. Outside it was raining and it made a soft accompaniment to the deathly silence. A clock on the wall was ticking steadily, marking time in a room where everything had stopped. Someone coughed, a sudden sharp cough that thundered in the stifling silence. The truth lay between them, indisputable but not admitted; only someone had to have the courage, or the desperation, to say it out loud. No one dared to be the first to break this horrible and precarious silence.",
        " I tightened my coat and saw my breath rising in little clouds into the mist. It was cold, the fog thick, as I came out of the station into the streets. My footsteps rang out on the pavement in the familiar rhythmic rhythm of the market-place, joined by the distant hum of the early morning sledges and the clatter of shop-doors as they opened. The well-known sights and sounds, so comfortingly well-known, were reassuring in their consistency; but today there was something different. There were no greetings, the customary nod of the heads of the familiar faces—the barman who was already putting the chairs out at the café on the corner, the newsagent who was arranging his news-stand with fresh papers. It was about ten past six, twenty minutes still before I had to be at the office. I looked at my watch. I had twenty minutes to spare. Maybe it was because the fog had sucked the outlines of the houses down to their roof-trees, so that even the noises were dulled, muffled, as though the whole of London was holding its breath. The routine of my life had been broken, and I halted. My usual course would have been to continue, but something inside was attracting me to that unexpected light, and I was drawn from the path I knew into the unknown. A pale golden light was beckoning to me from the entrance-way, throwing the grey morning into relief like an invitation.",
        " “Be careful,” he said to me on our walks. “Beware of everything around you.” My father had warned me since I was a child. He taught me to observe the crowds, to take in the exits in the buildings where I was going, to keep an eye on my own. I thought he was being overprotective like most parents, but later I realized that his teachings were more than a simple caution. It was only in college that I learned why he had been training me like this. My friends thought it was odd that I sat with my back to the door when we went to a restaurant and that I remembered with great detail a passer-by who had walked past us a moment ago, and they laughed at my sudden silences when I suddenly noticed something strange. I asked my professor why he kept quiet about my father’s military service and he opened his eyes wide: “Your father was one of the most gifted military spies I have ever known,” he said. On the professor’s wall was a photo of an army group in their khakis and the group included a younger version of my father. That evening my father explained to me the reason why I had learned to be cautious and suspicious from an early age. “He was aware of danger long before others.”",
        " The Detective shrugged her coat against the autumn cold, watching the forensic workers systematically cleaning up the crime scene. The yellow tapes fluttered in the wind, setting up a line around what had been someone’s sanctuary. The odor of oxidizing blood hung in the night air. “It’s the same signature?” she asked. “Third one this month,” Sergeant Reynolds came up, holding two paper cups of coffee, and he gave her one. “The placement of the wounds, the precision. It’s him.” Morrow nodded, gratefully taking a sip. “But this time, it’s different.” This body had been found in an abandoned warehouse, not a house. She edged closer to the edge of the yellow tapes, being careful not to contaminate the scene. “He’s getting more daring,” she muttered, “or desperate.” The killer was changing, taking new risks. She could feel her pulse quickening. In the shadows, something glinted, something small half-hidden under a broken beam. The metallic odor grew stronger as the clouds scudded apart, letting the moonlight illuminate what the scene lights couldn’t. “We need an expert over here,” she called. Perhaps the hunter would be the hunted tonight.",
        " Without knowing more about the situation it is hard to know exactly what kind of mishap is involved, or whether the judge is right or not. If it is part of a scenario or roleplay, I can continue with it. The wording suggests that it is a matter of comforting people by reassuring them that an injury is minor and that they may go on with their work. But if it is a real injury, it would be better to go to the doctor rather than try to judge the extent of the wound yourself, especially if there is any doubt.",
        " One eye opens. Both eyes blink against the glare of the bright fluorescent light. The world appears blurred with white and the soft beige of straw. You try to move and feel the IV syringe in your arm. You cough. The hospital room comes into focus—the sterile walls, the steady beeping of the monitors, the faint smell of disinfectant that clings to everything. A nurse, noticing that you’re awake, approaches you with her even, careful steps. When you came to, all you remember was the voices of the people in the ER and the ceiling tiles that passed as they pushed you into the room. How long have you been here? “It’s been three days, and the doctor wants to know you’re awake.” “Welcome back,” she says with a pleasant familiarity. The doctor will be here soon with the answers. But right now you are feeling, sore but intact, alive and awake after the dark. Your fingers seek the call button, and in a moment the doctor is there. Slowly the memories return—the sharp pain, the ambulance, the people’s worried faces, and the blue sky outside the window you haven’t seen for days.",
        " I sensed her before seeing her. I had come to anticipate it; the room grew cool, a little, enough to make the hairs on my arms stand up. She was there again, she was present. Then, eyes on my book, pretending to read, my eyes kept searching the corner of the room for the familiar shimmer. It was always different, and the air became thick, like walking through invisible silk, making each breath a pause. Tonight, her presence was reflected in the window, a face, not quite mine, reflected back from the outside night. Sometimes a shadow, with no light source, no colour. “You’re early tonight,” I said, finally, still not looking her in the face. I had learned not to acknowledge her presence too quickly; that only made her retreat. I put my book aside, noticing a slight breeze in the curtain. The windows were closed, stoutly closed, to keep out the autumn cold. “You’re restless?” I went on, picking up the little wooden box on the bedside table. “I think it might be yours.”",

        " The colours of the sky were a deep blue, melting into violet, where the brush left its trace, glistening in the sunlight streaming through the window. The man moved the brush slowly along the canvas, and his fingers trembled faintly—not from hesitation, but from the weight of thought he was bringing to bear on each stroke. He dipped the brush in a rich ochre, and again came to the canvas, with a renewed energy. Twenty years of painting, and still that moment of revelation when the image in his mind came to life before him, still made his heart beat. He stepped back, his eyes narrowing as he looked at the picture that was emerging. The horizon trembled under his hand as the memory came back, but he calmed himself and continued. The landscape that was forming before him was not a random view, it was the cliff-top on which he had proposed to Sarah years ago, before the illness came to take her, before the house became still. He was remembering. Sometimes painting was a way of forgetting. Today it was both.",

A blue carpet stretches over this tropical sea like a crystal clear Caribbean sea, and the clouds float sluggishly over it like the white sails of the boats on that deep blue sea. The whole world below seems to respond to this overwhelming clarity with intensified colors, as if everything was more alive under such a perfect sky. On days like this, the line between sky and imagination is blurred, as if the thought of the day was floating in the direction of the distant, slow clouds.",

Empathy is a foreign language, misunderstanding is our mother tongue. Perhaps what makes it all the more tragic is our awareness. We know the pattern, we know our shortcomings, yet we find it hard to break free. Is this rock truly abandoned, or merely a place we have not yet mastered? We recognize our failure, and in doing so we reveal a desire for something better, for something greater. Perhaps the answer is not to be found in the grand solutions, but in those small, elusive moments when understanding does come, rare as they may be.",
        " The Great Wall, they said, could be seen from space, but now I was not so sure; the pictures of the satellite showed nothing but sea in the place of the great country. The Vanishing China: gone. The international telephones were crowded with people trying to get through to loved ones; the compass dragged round the coordinates. No slow, cataclysmic event, caught on film, but, merely, overnight, it was gone. Scientists were baffled. Geologists maintained that a landmass of that size could not have disappeared without an earth tremor that was felt all over the world. Those ships which had gone out there returned with confused crews who reported deep and unknown waters. The United Nations held an emergency meeting. I looked at my grandfather’s faded photograph of the Forbidden City, and wondered if it was just a memory now or whether, somewhere, in some manner, a billion people went on living, unseen. The conspiracy theories began to flourish, extraterrestrials, inter-dimensional portals, government cover-ups. The Vanishing China was just the first of a great many things. What else would disappear, in its turn, without warning? And still, no explanation. The world’s economies dipped. The world had changed. Like the ground beneath our feet, what other things were as uncertain as they were solid?",
        " I pressed my hand to the laceration in my forehead and groaned at the sharp pain. A stream of blood had found its way along my cheeks and was dripping out over one eye. I tried to get up, but my legs were trembling and I sank back on my knees. The streetlamps above were flickering and a streak of light was moving uncertainly down the empty street. The cold of the night touched my skin and was a sharp contrast to the warmth of the blood in my hand. Minutes? Hours? How long had I been here? Someone must have called for help. There was a siren in the distance. The blow to the head had knocked out my sense of time. I felt for my phone, but my pockets were empty, as were my wallet and my keys. Or perhaps the ambulance had come for someone else, unaware of my condition. I had to move, get shelter, find out what had happened. But first I had to remember. A realization like a cold blanket had settled over me: This was no accident. What had I seen? What did I know? The memory was there, somewhere in the distance, veiled in pain and confusion. But the throbbing pain in my head was coming to an end. I had a faint sense of what had happened. I leaned against the wall and slowly stood up. The siren grew louder.",

        " ‘Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, in the house and watching at home, ladies and gentlemen, our next guest is a truly spirited performer, and hails to us from the heart of New Orleans! With three platinum albums and a voice that can literally shake the heavens, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the sensational Melody Rivers!’ The audience burst into a storm of applause and, as the spotlights moved to one side of the stage, Melody appeared in a shimmering, green, sequined gown that caught every ray of light in the studio, her trademark curls swaying at every step as she came onstage and gave a great, easy wave. ‘Our pleasure,’ said Nick, leaning forward eagerly. ‘We hear you have some very big news to share with us.’",
        " Then he lied down on the mountain grass, and the light wind blew on him., The smell of a wild flower and pine trees smelled good. I have imagined many times what it would be like to have such a moment to live. The night sky was bright, and the sky was not dimmed by the light of the city. It was not that the stars only twinkled, but burned with ancient light, and the light of the milky way was also visible. The stars were ringing, but some were brilliant white, some were blue, and some were red. The light of the stars seemed to be linked together, and there was a feeling of solidarity. Time slowed down. Compared with this, the cares of life became very small. Have you ever felt the charm of the night sky, and have you ever wanted to have such an experience? How about you?",
        " ‘There, all done! You’ve done very well,’ she said with an encouraging smile as she threw the needle into the sharps box. Then she pulled out the needle and stuck a plaster on the small hole. ‘How long before I feel any after-effects?’ Sarah said, releasing a breath she hadn’t known she was holding, and she tested her arm, which felt slightly tense. ‘If you have any reaction at all, it’s usually quite mild,’ said the nurse, and she made a note on the chart. ‘The most common symptom is soreness where the injection was, but some people feel tired or have a mild fever.’ She asked, rolling up her sleeve. ‘And I’ll be back in three weeks for the second dose, is that right?’ Sarah nodded and picked up her purse and her jacket. ‘You can make an appointment at the desk when you leave,’ said the nurse, handing her a small card that contained a note of today’s injection and when she would need the second one. ‘A small needle for you, a big step towards protecting yourself and others.’ As she stood up to go, Sarah felt a strange combination of relief and pride.",

        " They all clustered around him, their faces grim with curiosity. “Just look at this one,” James bragged, pushing his shirt up to the neck, revealing a long reddish-brown, bumpy scar, which extended from the lower corner of his spine to his right shoulder blade. “Hold it!” Marcus cried, craning his neck to get a closer look. “That’s cool. How did you get it?” “Do you remember that hike last summer, to the Eagle Ridge? I went ahead of the group...” James turned away, a smug smile on his face. “And you got lost?” “You sure did!” Sarah said, rolling her eyes. “I was climbing along the rocky ridge when the ledge gave way. I fell thirty feet into a ravine.” “She might as well say ‘shoots’,” James remarked, and the others grinned at him. “And you went back up the mountain with that?” Eli asked, his eyebrows raised incredulously. “I cut my back on a sharp rock on the way down.” “I had to,” James said, shrugging. “No cell service out there.” “I’ll show you something better,” Mia said, rolling up her sleeve. “I wiped out on my mountain bike. The hospital said I was lucky the spine wasn’t broken.”",
        " Jocelyn was almost frozen, breathless, as the creature finished its strange inspection and withdrew. Its eyes—if they could be called eyes—blinked one after the other. You are right. I ought to have told the story in the third person. I will tell it in the third. Who are you? It asked in a mechanically precise but organically sonorous voice. “Human female, adequate specimen,” it said. The creature’s head was bent in a motion that was disturbingly birdlike. “What do you want?” Jocelyn asked, surprised at her voice’s calmness in spite of her pounding heart. “We are observing. We are collecting. You are interesting.” It held out one of its appendages. “Come,” it said, as behind it the wall of her apartment shifted and changed into something like a corridor. Jocelyn’s mind was spinning. “Or stay. It’s up to you.” “If I come with you, will I be able to come back?” Her instincts were telling her to run away, scream, and wake up, to scream for help and wake up from what she thought was a nightmare. But she also had a lifelong curiosity about the unknown, a scientist’s curiosity about the unknown. “Time moves differently in our world,” the creature said, perhaps laughing. “Is it possible to come back?” She took a deep breath and took a step toward the impossibility of the door and what lay beyond it. “It is possible to come back. It is different, but it is possible.”",
        " The firestorm was sweeping through the city. In between screams like a frightened child and running for cover, I made a plan, a desperate, unformed plan that I had contrived in a few moments while fleeing burning debris. The air was full of smoke and corrosive fumes, and breathing was hard. Water, a refuge.... My eyes, bleary with tears, saw the canal that cut through the eastern district. The heaviness of my grandfather’s watch in my breast pocket, which was now a constant companion, ticked seconds that were now all too precious. I clutched the backpack I had quickly filled with photographs, papers, and the food I had been able to find when the first bombs exploded. The distance. The time. I shouted “This way!” to a small group of strangers, a group of disorientated people behind an overturned truck. A woman with a baby pressed to her breast was the first to understand. “The canal! We can go out through the canal!” I tried not to think about the things and the people I was leaving behind. She took the hand of the old man next to her and all of us, strangers to each other, moved at once, with the sole common goal of survival.",
        " While other children during a stay abroad could hardly put together the simplest sentence, Sophia was talking to the locals in Berlin. She had learnt the language from her grandmother, who had emigrated from Munich years ago. Her parents looked on with pride as she ordered for them in restaurants, translated a museum for them and even helped a lost child in a crowded bazaar. She spoke with such a natural accent that the Germans often responded with a long and complicated answer before they realized she was an American girl. What made her language skills even more extraordinary was that she could move so easily from a girl’s banter about ice cream and unicorns in English to a conversation about German history and architecture in her second language. The two languages gave her a window into a different world which most of her classmates at home could not even imagine.",
        " Then the headman said to him, “You do not see me most days. I was a horrible squirt when I was alive, and I never believed in such nonsense as ghosts or spirits. Sometimes, if I concentrate, I can move small things — a copper or a paper-clip. Not enough to upset you, but enough to make you doubt your own sanity. I am the chill in your hallway, the whisper in an empty room, the feeling that you are being watched when you are alone.” “I’m bored. Eternity is a long time to be bored. And you have such interesting secrets — and things that are better left unsaid. I’m sizing you up, I’m listening, I’m watching, and I’ll make you pay. I know what you did. Not that I can tell anyone.",
        " Emma, confident of her right to the pavement, and thinking only of her forthcoming report, went forward into the lane. The green man was lit up, but the car did not stop. The passengers gasped as she was thrown several feet. The driver, a young man called Talwin, had been reading his telephone as he was coming to the corner; he lifted his eyes and saw Emma, and tried to apply the brake with all his strength, but the momentum carried him on. The accident, the result of a momentary distraction, would have for both of them a lasting effect, Emma having a long and painful recovery, and for Talwin the moral and legal consequences of his action. He was astonished and looked guilty. He sat in the driver’s seat, numb with surprise and guilt. A telephone was called and another passer-by, a nurse on her way to work, hastened to help Emma.",
        " “What do you mean, blinded?” I turn, startled by the voice and the sound of uneven footsteps behind me. And through the haze of my eyes I can see a hunched figure. The figure comes nearer, and its huffing and puffing can be heard in the silence. “Who are you?” I say, my voice trembling slightly, and I stop my hurried step. “The light,” he says, waving his hand in front of my eyes, “you looked at something you shouldn’t have. You shouldn’t have been looking at it. ” He’s an old man, I can see that, and he has a heavy limp, which explains his irregular steps. My eyes feel scratchy, I’ve gradually become aware of it, and I’ve been putting it down to tiredness, worry, everything except what this stranger is suggesting. I rub my eyes instinctively. I’ve seen it before. He laughs, thinly. “How do you know?” I ask suspiciously. “I made the same mistake as you. Listen carefully, you’ve not much time left before it becomes a lasting blindness.”",

        " The first reaction of most people is disbelief and dismay. They may think: “It can’t be true, or this has got to be some mistake.” This reaction is an important defense mechanism, which helps people gradually accept the news. Questioning and anger often occur at the same time, with questions like “Why me?” or “How could this happen?” As denial subsides, strong emotions often come to the fore—usually anger, which can be directed toward the deceased, toward the doctors, toward the family, or even at oneself. This anger is usually unjustified and represents a way of expressing the pain of bereavement. Common responses are “Why them?” and “Why me?” Often the anger subsides, and sadness replaces it. Bargaining is an attempt to regain some control. Acceptance does not mean that one is happy about the loss; it is just the opposite—a way of dealing with the new reality. People withdraw, feel overpowered by sadness, and wonder what good there is in going on. These are not mental disorders but appropriate responses to major losses. These reactions may be sequential or simultaneous, but each person’s bereavement is unique. Eventually they learn to live with the loss, they adjust to the changed situation, and they learn to reintegrate their lives.",
        " At her table she monopolized conversations on the subject of the afterlife, while the guests stiffened at the thought of the blazing flames that would burn them. Purgatory was her mania; she collected books on the subject, theological treatises, medieval descriptions, Dante’s vision, which crowded together in the bedroom, and she read them almost as she was reading to sleep. “It’s not a punishment,” she argued, her eyes shining with fervor, “it’s a purification, like polishing silver that’s tarnished.” She remained smiling, when asked: “I’m practising.” Her husband noticed that she had begun to riddle her skin with tiny burns, pricks of the candle flame, which drew her white and bloated face. The family called it a nervous breakdown; the doctors a religious obsession. “I want to be ready.” But she did not see herself thus; she was practising, simply practising for the inevitable fire in which everything that was not of essence would be consumed.",
        " I knew that I was at the head of the troops for one reason: to become cannon fodder for the enemy. “Forward!” shouted my king. I was not a knight but a peasant dragged from his fields a few weeks earlier, handed a weapon, and told to die well. I felt crushed by my inadequate armor, a cruel reminder of my social position. The hooves thundered, my hands trembling, I grabbed my lance with my trembling hands. The enemy’s cavalry would sweep through us like scythes through wheat, and we would be used to crush them, before the real army could engage. About me, I saw others like me, peasants, blacksmiths, tanners, all with the same vacant stare. We knew what was in store for us. The first reflections of the enemy’s armor appeared on the horizon. I thought of my wife and children, and wondered whether they would ever know how I had fallen. Would my name be preserved, or would I be counted among the unknown dead? I raised my lance, I felt my mortality, I swung it. “Steady!” The captain shouted behind me, no emotion in his voice. At that moment I was no longer fighting for king or country but only to be able to see my family once more. “Soldiers to arms!” was the cry from the rear, where the lords and knights waited safely behind our disposable bodies.",
        " The next morning, I was awakened by the delicate tolling of a crystal bell which seemed to have reached my ears from every house in the city. From my window I could see the residents come out on their balconies and terraces and raise their heads to look up at the enormous auroral arch above them. The festival of the northern lights was about to begin. The city of the Northern Light, Part Two —————— Children held lanterns in their hands which contained a tiny fragment of the auroral haze. The street merchants had their stalls decorated with light-providing flowers and with ribbons of a color suggestive of the shades of the auroral haze. The streets, which had been empty yesterday evening, were now full of life. We followed the procession which was heading toward the square which was called the Square of the Northern Lights. An enormous ice statue had been erected there during the night. It was a perfect model of the city and about twenty feet high, and through the narrow channels of its lower part flowed a liquid auroral stream. The entire town had been constructed out of this ice, and my host family explained to me that this day was the first day of the week in which the northern lights were to be at their strongest. “It is at this time that the veil between worlds is thinnest,” said Einar, winking. When night came, the real spectacle began. Musicians were playing instruments I had never seen before, harps with strings which seemed to be made of light, drums which not only made a sound but also released a colored vapor at every stroke, and the music itself seemed to be an actual entity. It was a strange musical existence that swept through the crowd and made the air vibrate with a magical harmony. Then, for a moment, the city was bathed in waves of emerald, violet and gold. The northern lights were growing stronger above us, and the light controllers of the city, the true artists among them, began their work. Using their special rods and instruments, they conducted the northern lights in a musical composition, and, as the music was played, they turned the light rays of the aurora into geometrical patterns which were dancing on the dome above. “Is this the first time you have been to this festival?” she asked me when she noticed my astonishment. I was standing beside an old woman with an old, wrinkled face, but her eyes were shining. “This is my first time in the northern lights,” I answered her. “Then you must visit the gallery of whispers before you leave.” She smiled. “Would you like me to continue my story about the city of the northern lights? There you will see true magic.”",
        " As she grew up, she seemed to grow into her name. Agnes was a name that her parents had chosen with great care, with a view to a name that would not be commonplace, but which was both ancient and striking. Her parents remarked, more than once, that she seemed to observe everything in advance, whether it was a new toy or a new person. There was a quiet determination, a profound attention, which they noticed from the very first years. She took up astronomy in her youth. During her school days she aspired to become an astrophysicist. Her room was gradually hung with maps of the heavens and pictures of nebulae and galaxies. She spent hours in the back garden with a small telescope that her grandfather had given her for her eighth birthday, taking notes of the stars and studying the constellations. What would life have in store for Agnes if she were to follow her dream of studying the heavens? Her teachers were pleased at her zeal, and their admiration for her talent for mathematics and physics, which she had an unrivalled aptitude for.",

        " The Vigil of the Gods We guard the gods. In the intervals between prayer and silence we keep watch. Few know our order, and fewer still our object. The gods are no longer what they were. Their power has diminished with the changing tides of belief. We were founded when the first god began to weaken. We understood what others could not: that the divine is not immutable. Others have become erratic and dangerous, in their frantic efforts to be remembered. And, in their dying moments, they have released forces which exceed the understanding of men. Gods can be wounded. Gods can die. The boundaries between worlds must be maintained. We maintain the old rites, not through devotion, but through necessity. In forgotten temples and sacred groves we stand watch. Our numbers are diminishing with each generation. The sleeping gods must not be disturbed. The dying gods must be gently aided in their passage into oblivion. The gods may forget themselves. But we persist, for to abandon our task would invite a catastrophe beyond all imagining. We are the guardians of the gods. They may forget their own purpose, but we will not forget our own. Our vigil continues.",
        " In his usual commanding tone, he said: “Lord God of mercy and pity.” Then, as he looked up, his eyes became wider than his face. Captain Adahy von Krasny watched with wonder as the ancient door creaked open, revealing a chamber that had been closed for centuries. Stepping forward, he heard the floor humming strangely; his hand instinctively seized the sword, but he knew that steel was no match for the forces that guarded this place. He saw that the chamber was full of extraordinary objects, some made of crystal that seemed to float in space, some containing writing that seemed to change as he looked at it, and, at the center of it, a metal plate that seemed to contain a map and which trembled like mercury. Amid the unease that had come over him, his mind was filled with the possible consequences of this discovery, for himself, for his crew, for his ship, perhaps even for the known world. He was alone, but he heard his first mate rushing after him. “After all these years,” he murmured, “the vault of Isandor is not only a legend.",
        " The ancient souls of Elysium float about as luminous, pure conscious beings. They have the memory of infinite epochs. In Elysium, the natural order is inverted; souls arrive full of wisdom, and as they gradually lose their knowledge, they gradually enter the material world. Older souls meet in intellectual communities, not to acquire knowledge, but to make careful choices about the knowledge they will shed. They share with the younger ones the wisdom that they will soon forget. The younger souls, closest to childbirth, are beginning to feel the attraction of the material world; they are almost solidified; their memories have been distilled to the essentials. They celebrate this ritual forgetting in beautiful, intricate ceremonies. The community gathers to watch the souls’ passing from Elysium to the mysterious adventure of material life. Then the birth, at once an end and a beginning, is bitter-sweet. You could have been an observer at any one of these inverted anniversaries. Would you like me to talk about one in particular?",
        " In the void of sound a wordless whispering of dust motes, a barely perceptible creaking of floorboards settling in their age-old places, a long-faded memory of laughter which once filled the room, was heard. All the pins remained still as if they were holding their breath; their metal bodies trembled with the effort of their breath-holding. The silence stretched, like a thread between moments, the fragile and anxious weight of expectancy. And then, one of the pins breathed out, a soft sigh of surrender, and the spell began to disintegrate thread by thread. The world outside continued its chaotic symphony, but here, in this isolated pocket of unimaginable stillness, even the air molecules seemed to have paused in their eternal dance. Somewhere a clock refused to tick, as if time itself had agreed to the conspiracy of silence.",

        " Angela was standing motionless at the window, clutching the edge of the curtain, watching the street, almost believing that someone was watching the house. The phone rang for the fifth time, a shrill ringing that cut the silence of the apartment. Her eyes flew to the receiver. Five calls in an hour, every time just a buzz and then silence. The buzzing ceased, and suddenly the silence was almost as abrupt as the buzzing. Until the sixth call. Then it was \"Unknown.\" The buzzer went off and was followed by a second or two of silence. Then came the answering-machine, \"Please leave a message after the tone. \" Then silence. Then, instead of the regular gasp, a voice, low, distorted, as if it had been passed through some device, \"I see you standing by the window, Angela, and you look nice with the blue curtains.\" How did they know? Her hand jumped away from the curtain as if burned. She staggered back, her heart pounding. Whoever had called had been watching her. She had gone to the window a second before the call.",
        " Sergeant Reeves had taken a step back, his face twisted with horror. Corporal Fulton’s body was rapidly dissolving, his hands first, and then his arms, the deterioration advancing up his arms like a macabre time-lapse photograph of decomposition. Bits of the corporal were dissolving, flying into the air in scales, lost in the rushing wind. Fulton did not cry out; his eyes remained wide open, his expression one of bewilderment, as if he were not conscious of what was happening to him. “Jesus Christ,” Private Mercer whispered, color draining from his face. Captain Torres picked up her receiver. “Sixth Air Force, this is Forward Outpost Seven.” The ashy-colored scales continued to fly off Corporal Fulton’s body, blown away by the wind. “Sixth Air Force, Forward Outpost Seven, this is Forward Outpost Seven. We have a situation here. I repeat, a medical emergency.” Lieutenant Walsh, medical kit in hand, was cautiously advancing when he halted. Only a crackling answered him. He was approaching Corporal Fulton’s torso, which was already beginning to crumble. His mouth opened—to cry out, perhaps, to beg—but no sound came, only the strange, sparkling dust. “I don’t know what to do,” he admitted in a croaking voice. “Everybody back, now.” “Quarantine protocol,” Captain Torres ordered, her training guiding her steps despite the unprecedented nature of the situation. “What was in that cave?” Sergeant Reeves muttered, as much to himself as to anyone else. They all obeyed the order, except Lieutenant Walsh, who stood motionless, watching his comrade disintegrate before his eyes. The wind was picking up, gathering up all that had been Corporal James Fulton, leaving only his boots, standing in the sand. “What the hell did we find in there?”",

        " With a professional flick of his wrist he closes the lock, putting the revolver back in his shoulder-holster. Again he examines his revolver and feels the weight of his 38 special in his hand. He spins the cylinder and sees that the six chambers are loaded. The sodium vapour lamps in the car park throw sickly yellow pools of light, but they are hardly enough to dispel the darkness. The rain begins to fall, drumming on the window. Through the rain-streaked glass the warehouse looks even more sinister, a monstrous mass against the night. He has time to get himself ready but not much. The exchange is due at midnight, Carver said. He checks his watch: it’s forty-two minutes to midnight. He makes his way rapidly across the car park, keeping close to the shadows, his shoes splashing in the puddles, reflecting the distorted red of the neon sign of the adjacent abandoned factory. He turns up the collar of his raincoat and walks out into the driving rain. The rain soaks him through to his neck. Somebody’s already here. As he nears the side entrance to the warehouse he stops, noticing something, and a little startled. Fresh tyre-marks in the mud.",

Sometimes it tells the story of the day, premeditating the solutions to our problems and the conversations we’re going to have; sometimes it wanders off into dreams or worries. This inner dialogue has an effect on our understanding of the world around us. The inner voice grows with us through life, influenced by our parents, our friends, our teachers, our experiences. It takes on all those influences and makes a mosaic, but it is always our own. It is this voice which is now reading these words to you, as your eyes follow the text. How do you relate to this inner voice? Getting to know it, learning to recognize when it’s being unreasonably harsh, and learning to steer it towards compassion, is a great achievement that many spend a lifetime trying to learn.",
        " It was not the omnipresence of God that troubled him, but the remembrance of what he had left behind. Throughout his life, Lucifer had been trying to avoid the shadow of God, and it had been a difficult task. Wherever he turned, whatever world he fled to, that radiance seemed to follow him. The earth, however, was where he felt most safe, a place of anonymity and disorder. He sat at a dirty earthly bar, sipping a glass of whisky, which burned, but not nearly as much as his memories. A smile crossed his face. “Another?” asked the barman, looking at the empty glass. “I’ve nothing to do right now.” He was not unaware of the irony, that he had rebelled for freedom, but still here he was, defining himself by his relationship with the Almighty. Perhaps the true liberation was not to escape the shadow of God, but to make his own.",
        " The flight was already twice postponed and the airport was packed with frustrated travelers. I was tired, I had just come back from a business trip to Chicago, and I was looking forward to getting home. The announcement “Final boarding for flight 372 to Boston” finally came over the speakers, and I picked up my briefcase and my briefcase and went with the tired line towards the gate. In the meantime I was sitting in my uncomfortable plastic chair and mentally swiping through e-mails that I was too tired to understand. But when I stood up, a woman was in front of me, holding a worn paperback, and she looked familiar. Maybe it was just the delirium of fatigue. As we walked forward, she lost her boarding pass and I reached out for it at the same time as she did, our hands almost touched, and she looked up at me and said, “Thank you.” “Wait... don't I know you?” Her eyes opened a little.",
        " Judge Harmon with a sigh, took off her glasses, went back to her office, and it was the end of the session. The session broke up, the crowded courtroom was quickly emptying, the lawyers gathered up their papers and the spectators, stepping out of the door, went into the corridor. Outside in the corridor, prosecutor Reyes and her colleagues were in a conference. Marcus Chen, who was defending, sat down and looked at the exhibit list with his pen, still at the table, taking notes and glancing at the lists of evidence. This morning's testimony was rather harmful, the forensic accountant traced the money from one layer of the shell company to the other, and all the way it seemed to be a web. The defendant, Eleanor Whitfield, was sitting in a small conference room, silently looking out the window at the city. \"We need the bank documents in the Cayman Islands before the redirection,\" she whispered, \"and the judge won't give us a continuance.\" The bailiff called from the door, \"twenty minutes!\" The fraud charge carries a maximum of fifteen years. The city, which is tens of stories below, looked like ants; people didn't even notice that her whole life was at stake. The people who had been in the conference room went back to their places and the chess game of high-stakes games was to begin again.",
        " There, before the telephones had stopped ringing, all was as it was five summers before. She sat down at the table in her living room and straightened the picture of her family. The familiar faces were smiling at her, frozen in a moment five summers before, when everything had been different. The telephone, which was already charged up, lay in her hand; she drew it towards her, she clung to it with a protective grip. How many times had she practised what she was going to say? Before the silence. Her thumb rested on the screen, already charged up, but not yet sent. The clock on the wall in the empty house struck a loudly measured minute, a further minute of hesitation. Outside, the rain fell, beating on the window, matching the unsteady beat of her heart. The apologies, the explanations, the soft plea for understanding. The telephone rang, and she touched her daughter’s face on the picture, wondering whether after all this time her voice would still sound the same. She took a deep breath and pressed the ‘call’ button.",
        " “Hello, Gabe. Thanks for connecting today. What can I do for you?”",
        " Between his heartbeats, he notices what he would normally have ignored: a blue flower emerging from a crack in the concrete; an ant carrying a piece of bread three times its own size; the wear on his once polished shoes. He looks down. The ground is incomprehensibly far, and yet his feet are firmly on it. He ought to raise his gaze, face what awaits him, but this downward look is safer. Here, no decision is made. Time stretches out like a strip of taffy. He breathes deeply, feeling the weight of his lungs. His mobile phone vibrates in his pocket, reminding him that the world keeps on turning, even when he withdraws for a moment. In the periphery, without his knowing it, he sees the consequences. The path ahead is different. Not easier, perhaps, but clearer.",
        " This piece is apparently either the beginning of a creative writing piece or a fragment of a story you’re writing. The story has something of a science-fiction or fantasy setting, with a character who may be a robot or armour. It seems you’ve shared with us a conversation between characters called Nathan and someone with green shoulder plates, who speaks with a kind of half-robotic voice, and are discussing a character called Peach, who is on her way to see someone called Lara. I’d be happy to help you with your creative writing in any way that might be useful to you. Would you like me to help you develop the story further, to help you analyse the characters, or give you some feedback on the style of the piece?",
        " The knife, with a wooden handle worn smooth by years of handling, stuck out between the ribs. Monroe and I examined the body, lying on the floor of the kitchen, with the face of the murdered man turned towards us in some sort of astonishment. Monroe knelt at the side of the body, a latex glove crackling as he examined the victim's wrist. \"When was he killed?\" I asked. \"By the rigors of the liver, between midnight and two o'clock,\" said the doctor. I looked around the kitchen. \"The murderer was probably someone he knew,\" I said, noticing a half-full bottle of wine on the counter, with two glasses. The victim was still wearing a bathrobe and slippers. There was no sign of violence. , the doctor nodded and studied the pattern of the blood splashes on the wall. \" A single blow, obliquely upward. Someone he had been sharing a drink with. A competent murderer.\" I saw a small pad next to the phone, with a torn cover, but with some traces of writing on the next sheet. \" Get me a pencil,\" I said. \"I think the victim left us a message.\"",
        " Silvia and I were celebrating our second anniversary, and we’d been planning to celebrate it all week, with some special celebration. I decided to take her back to the café where we had met: it was a small, unprepossessing, cosy place with ill-assorted furniture and the best cappuccinos in town. I had arranged with the proprietor to have our table, by the window, reserved, and I’d managed to track down the waitress who had served us on our first awkward evening, two years ago, and put our photo on the table, with a special dessert she’d made for us. It was quite a surprise to Silvia: the table set with her favourite flowers, the photographs of our various adventures in the city, and a special dessert the chef had made for us. We spent a wonderful evening together, the evening was just right, simple and important, celebrating not only the anniversary, but the way we had traveled. Do you want me to continue with this story, and go into detail?",
        " “This is the story of Sir Geoffrey’s career: While the other boys were playing with wooden swords, I was learning the true art of war with my father’s trainer, Sir Roland the Stern. At the age of seven, my hands were hardened by the daily use of the sword and the shield; at the age of ten, I was riding like one with the horse, guiding the horse with my knees while my hands were free for combat; at the age of twelve, I was jousting with squires twice my age in practice — all to the great pride of my father, who covered his eyes. My mother, Lady Eleanor, would sometimes watch from the castle towers, with a face that was both anxious and forbearing. The bells of the abbey marked not only the prayers, but also my daily exercises: at dawn I went to the archery range, at midday to the school of the sword, and at night to the study of strategy and the chivalric code. Thus did my childhood go, not as a time of play and diversion, but as one of preparation. Despite all, she ensured that I learned the courtly manners along with my martial skills, for what use is a knight who cannot behave properly in the halls of his master? For my parents’ high hopes were as heavy on my shoulders as my armor, shaping me into the knight I would have to become.",
        " “Oh, a parcel? To me? How unexpected! I notice an amused expression on your face.” I pick up the parcel and examine it carefully. There’s no return address. This is rather strange. It’s not very heavy, not very big. All it has written on it is my name. I return to where we were sitting and look at you questioningly. I shake it and listen attentively to hear if it’s making any unusual sounds. I’m sure I should be cautious about opening an unexpected parcel. What do you think?",
        " So we have – 7. In sequence, then, it follows: 7 again. Hence, again, – 7. So we have, again, – 13. So we have 14. According to the descending scale of multiples, 7 and 4, it will probably follow that the next figure will be 1 + 0.5 = – 14, since according to the sequence the multiple is to be halved again from 1 to – 0.5. So we have 14.",

        " “You see something?” Hans leaned forward, and strained his eyes to discern the complicated design—it was something like a compass, but with unusual markings at the edges. The small golden insignia, which was out of place on the plain suit of the murdered man, glittered under the bluish-white light of the morgue. “This brooch,” Hans muttered, not taking his eyes off it. “I’ve seen it somewhere before, but I can’t think where.” Detecteur Rivera stepped up beside him. “Do you want me to bag it up as evidence?” he asked, and Hank nodded slowly, as his mind was whirling with ideas. The pathologist paused in her preparations. “Maybe our John Doe isn’t so anonymous after all,” Hans said, straightening up. “This brooch may be the first real clue.” He didn’t know of any associations or clubs in town with that design, but it rang a bell—perhaps from an old case he had worked on, or maybe from some experience he had had during his undercover work.",

        " The book is open on the wooden table, left open by the sleeper, who has long since fallen asleep. The cover moves in the breeze from the open window, and the tattered edges of the old leather cover flutter like the wings of a tired moth. The moonlight slants on the pages, which seem to breathe silvery-white in the darkness. Dust motes in the moonlight sway above the yellowed pages, while the scent of the book mingles with the smell of the night, which smells of jasmine from the garden below. The pages, like the wind, rustle and sway, as if the book itself were impatient to be read. The book, the finger, the eyes, wait for dawn to break the spell of night, to discover new worlds, to be rediscovered. The curtain of the window, which rises and falls in the wind, marks the rhythm of the night.",
        " The announcement hung in the air, bold and bare as the twigs of winter. We had tired of waiting for miracles, we were exhausted by our prayers, which were as eerily answered. Good-by, God, we said, and God damned if we meant it. In the absence of belief, the universe had grown, the stars were no longer the stars of God, it was only hydrogen, time, and the cold physics of things that did not need a creator. Faith had been a borrowed coat that didn’t fit our shoulders, we finally returned it to the lost and found of childhood. Yet sometimes, in silence, when the darkness is too close, the old words rise up again, the language of our dreams. What freedom, this godless space, to have one’s own mistakes, to have a wonder without worship, to face death without promises.",
        " ‘Yes,’ he said with a warm smile, and gave me a firm but friendly handshake. The tender pressure of his fingers around mine caused an unexpected thrill to pass through my body. ‘I’m Daniel,’ he said in a voice which was somehow slightly foreign, ‘I’m sorry I nearly ran you down there, I was in my own world.’ I let go of his hand, casually brushing a strand of hair behind my ear, and he gave me another smile. I realized all at once how long we had been holding hands. He looked down at his satchel with a flash, and I noticed a dog-eared book sticking out from it. ‘I’m Eliza,’ I said, noticing the book’s dog-eared pages, ‘it looks as though you’re a great reader.’ ‘I’m guilty as charged, it’s the third time I’ve read it,’ he said, and his face turned a faint shade of red. ‘Don’t apologize,’ I said, surprised at how well we got on together, ‘there are some strangers who deserve to be talked to.’ ‘Sorry, I have a habit of talking about books to strangers.’",
        " The well-known humming of the air-purifier greeted him, a lullaby with which he had become familiar in the course of the years. Jordy woke up in his underground chamber, where he felt warm and comfortable. It was not big, just the main room, kitchen, bathroom and a closet, but it was effective. He stretched under his thermal blanket, his joints cracking in the cool, circulated air. Immediately, automatic, the LEDs came on, imitating the rays of the sun he had not seen for 18 months. The digital clock on the nightstand showed seven o'clock, as every morning. He swung his feet over the cold concrete floor, which, despite the carpet he had taken down on his last trip, had still cooled his feet. He had carefully arranged every square foot. He shuffled into the kitchen and turned on the water-purifier. While he was waiting for it to come to life, he checked his food log. He could still have time in the underground. While waiting for his breakfast of reconstituted eggs and the valuable half cup of coffee, his eyes rested on the picture stuck to the wall beside his communication device. He still had at least three months' supply guaranteed, five if he stretched it. He needed to go scavenging again soon, despite the fact that it made him feel sick to his stomach. Another day had started underground, a day of survival. It had faded over the years, but their smiles were still there.",
        " His shoulders were bowed under the steel plates which were riveted to what was left of his muscles; the left arm hung mechanical, the pistons hissed with each jerk of the phantom fingers, the hydraulic fluid oozed like dark ichor from the seals. He seemed more beast than man, a savage amalgam of flesh and metal that seemed to be shaking with bloodlust. The war had taken his humanity long before it took his limbs. In the market, the crowd parted before him, mothers hugged their children, shopkeepers looked away. It was as it should have been. The dealer’s hands trembled when he approached. He stopped at an e-waste stall, his enhanced eye whirred as it adjusted its focus, its red targeting reticule glinted on the polished chrome of discarded servers. What the military surgeons had put together was nothing but a weapon that had memories of being a man. And the erector coils, the neural-interface adapters, the military-grade servos—these were what he needed. But death had already claimed most of him years ago. Such a request would be enough to put him to death in three provinces.",
        " From my perch on the hillside I could see the fire, a long shadow on the beach, and the figures moving in the fire’s light, a little blurred, in the soft, fresh evening air. They danced away, a faint, rhythmic pulse of music came to me through the coolness of the air. The evening went on, a blaze like a distant torch. The sand between my toes was still warm from the sun, the ocean stretched away like black glass, dotted with the stars. I hadn’t meant to find myself alone here under the stars, while the dancing was going on below me, but there was a special kind of loneliness that suited me tonight. Then I recognized the step of a solitary figure climbing up the winding path, a solitary figure, I knew it was Maya, she who always knew when I needed company and when I needed solitude. Tonight she seemed to have known I needed a bit of both. The salty, smoky night air was very close, we sat in comfortable silence, looking at the dancers, who shone in the darkness like torches. We could go back if we wanted, but it was far enough, we could breathe freely. “They’re wondering where you’ve gone,” she said, coming to sit next to me without my asking her. “I told them not to wait for you.”",

        " From his apartment on the forty-third floor, the people on the ground were only ants moving in a clear line. Aurelie looked out of the window at the jumble of metal trees that was the city. The glass towers piled up, like artificial redwoods, to the orange and pink reflections of the setting sun. The city was breathing, pulsating, in the heartbeat of the traffic lights, the rumbling of the subways, the continuous murmur of the eight million lives which intersect without ever knowing each other. She placed her hand on the cool glass. For ten years she lived in this capital and she was still a stranger to it. The programme never slept, and the boss seemed to be following him. The phone was ringing behind her on the desk. Probably for work. Then she turned away from the window, her resolution taken. But she was ignoring it, on this occasion, and let her gaze travel over the artificial forest, where each lighted blaze represented a story, a particular life, someone who could be as lonely as herself, alone in the midst of everything. On this evening, she would descend into this forest of metal, and she would try to find something real in the middle of the artificial.",
        " He opened the cardboard flaps in the light of the gas lamp, and found in it nothing of the sort that was in the other boxes, which contained merely a few tools and car parts. He was working at night in his grandfather's house, cleaning it out, and the only remaining room was the gar-age. The gas lamp in the garage was making dust particles dance in the electric rays. Jared felt something leather-like and old. He pulled it out and found an old leather-bound notebook, brown and cracked, with smooth edges that had been handled a great deal. The leather was yellowed by age, but it had been pressed in carefully, as if it were still new. A small wooden box, with an intricately carved lid, lay near it. Jared looked at his watch: almost midnight. A tattered ribbon lay in the middle of a page. He sat down on an old stool, brushed off the cobwebs, and opened the book at the page marked by the ribbon. He should go home, rest, and be up early for work the next day. But curiosity overcame him. It was his grandfather's handwriting, but more youthful and firmer than he remembered it, and it was all scrawled over with a smudgy pen. It described a remote place, a discovery which did not make any sense. It was July 17, 1962. As he looked at the wooden box, Jared thought it must contain the strange thing his grandfather had found. But as he tried to open the box, something slipped between the pages: an old photograph. The text was full of \"it\" and \"its strange properties.\" On the back of the photograph was written, in faded ink, \"The day everything changed. \" The picture showed his grandfather and a man Jared had never seen before. They were smiling, their arms around each other's shoulders, in front of what looked like the entrance to a cave. He had never heard his grandfather mention a Henry. \" Keep it secret, Henry.\"",
        " I can propose two alternative subjects which do not in any way trivialize serious historical events: 1. If you would like to continue to write about historical personages, I would be very glad to help you to find ways that do not run the risk of trivializing them. I’m sorry, but I can’t go on with this fiction, which would involve casual, friendly encounters with Adolf Hitler, because it might be interpreted as trying to humanize and thereby legitimize a person who was responsible for the genocide and the crimes against humanity. Would you like to try an alternative subject? 1. A fictional dialogue, in which the complex moral problems of historical memory are posed. 2. A story, in which historical personages are discussed by different characters. 3. A creative piece on the interweaving of athletics in different contexts.",
        " ‘Remember why we are standing here,’ he went on in a calm voice, unruffled by the impending battle. ‘They are coming,’ the commander whispered, glancing back at his brave and fearless men. The distant thunder of hooves redoubled, and every man grasped his weapon tighter. The veteran nodded grimly but firmly, but the younger ones hid their fear. The commander stepped between the rows of his soldiers, calmly passing his hand across their shoulders, urging them on and encouraging them to fight. ‘For our families, for our homes, for our freedom,’ he said. ‘Stay,’ he called, raising his sword. ‘Today we fight for all that must live.’ The battle line held steady, while fate was closing in, And every heartbeat marked the march of time. There, all together, under the arch of the sky, The brothers were standing tall, in this moment.",

        " The Nalpure Emperor Noxu, by the crystalline windows of the spire, could see the wide, sprawling city of Quorax, where its crowded, swarming population went about their lives, oblivious of the dark news that had just reached their emperor. He rubbed his hands together and stroked his own hairy head with his eight-fingered paw. His Chief Minister Meela bowed before him, her purple skin shimmering in the glow of the twin moons rising over the horizon. “Your Eminence,” she said, her voice soft and urgent. “The ships of darkness have sailed through the nebula of the Beyond,” she told him. “The ancient prophecy has come true.” The emperor’s tail began to twitch, a sign of the mental turmoil within. “The eminent men of the city await your command, and with your command, they can take all necessary measures to safeguard the kingdom.” “Tell me, Meela,” he said, glancing at her with all three of his amber eyes, “do we still remember how to fight?” In the last three centuries, the Nalpure had not seen a war. They had developed in art and science, their telepathic abilities used to enhance the healing power of their minds, rather than to sow the seeds of destruction.",

        " 'Men of Rome! Our glorious Emperor has... strategically retreated. We are the backbone of the greatest Empire the world has ever known. Discipline! Formation!' He struck his breastplate.'These strange invaders may have weapons we don't understand, tactics we haven't seen—but they don't have what we have!' The soldiers stood straighter, shields in line.'These barbarians may have terrified our illustrious Commander, but they haven't yet seen the true Rome! The blood of our fathers runs in our veins—the same blood that conquered Gaul, tamed Egypt, built roads and aqueducts throughout the known world!' he cried, and the men fell in, chanting with him. 'Let us stand as one man, one spirit, one body, one Roman Legion! For Rome! Not him, but our homes, our families, our Empire! And if we survive, we'll drag back that coward of a General by his precious cloak!' Nervous laughter, then the front line locked shields over their heads, then the front line drew up their shields over their heads. The Roman war machine began its regulated march towards the strange foe. The ground shook under their iron-shod feet. Forward! Forward!",
        " The feeble light that penetrated the heavy curtains made long, distorted shadows, which danced with the slightest movement of the trees outside. The darkness was velvet, and at the same time so thick that it even smothered the slender rays of light that struggled in from outside. It lay on the floor, devouring every corner and every nook with an almost sentient hunger. The silence was not empty, but was filled with the soft creak of the house that sank deeper into its foundations and whispered its secrets to the patient ear. The air was heavy, and even a breath suffocated with the dust and the memories. But underneath it all, beneath the dead-looking night, there was a restless presence, not belonging to the night and not afraid of it, waiting for the eyes to be accustomed and the mind to open to the things that hid in plain sight. And in the black twilight, even the objects that were once known to us were changed into strange shadows, their purpose forgotten and the edges blurred. And time seemed to be hanging in the air, a long moment stretched out as if the dark night itself had slowed its pace and stretched the moments into eternity.",
        " After college, football continued to be the center of his life. He knew that his chances of playing in the league were small, but he was an assistant coach at his high school. It was here that he discovered that he had a natural gift for teaching the game and simplifying the most complex tactics. The transition from player to coach was not always easy. He had to learn to take his competitiveness and channel it into the development of the young, rather than using it for his own benefit. He spent his weekend days watching professional games with his old college team. The old comradeship of those days was still there, but only for old times’ sake. Over the years, he became the head coach and established a program which became renowned for its high level of competition and its development of character. He was particularly happy when he was able to help those who, like him, saw football as a path to a college education. And football had given him not only an education, but also a place in the world and a purpose that he would never be without.",

        " Then he heard a light rattling, not of his careful footfalls, but in the house, in the passage of the house. He stopped, and tried to listen, all the while. The robber stopped, heart throbbing. He was sure that the family was on a two-day trip, he had seen them load the suitcases into the car that morning. Moonlight through a window cast long shadows on the stairs. Was the old house settling down, or was someone awake? Another noise broke the silence, a soft rattle and a noise of footsteps. The noises were very near each other, and he was not sure if they were coming from the master bedroom or from the corridor. He pressed his little flashlight to his hand, he considered, he continued to climb, or to retreat, to return to the ground floor. The thief slowly took his knife from his pocket, the coldness of the weapon did not comfort him, before the certainty that he was not alone. Too measured to be the house, too determined.",
        " In the oval office the tension was palpable, a bad guest. Outside the windows, rain sprang up like a death-knell. The President sat back in his chair and wiped his brow with a pristine white handkerchief. The Secretary of Defense nodded seriously. “So,” he said, in a lowered voice, but a steady one, “you’re telling me that we have less than forty-eight hours to react?” It wasn’t a question. The President shook his head. “Yes, Mr. President, our intelligence is conclusive. If we don’t take immediate action, the consequences could be catastrophic.” He looked round at the men of his security staff, the faces telling him the same thing—he was on uncharted ground. The President folded his handkerchief carefully and stuffed it into his breast pocket. “Get the ambassador on the line,” he said, bending forward, now, more resolutely, “and clear my schedule for the rest of the day. We won’t leave this room until we have a plan.”",

        " The hills, clothed in emerald green, seemed to meet the light of the sky. The sun, which reposed on the white clouds like a sheet of white paper, shone brightly in the background. The golden rays of the sun passed through the clouds like a pencil, and cut the expanse below with long fingers of light. The air was fragrant with the smell of rain. But the sun promised to keep the rain away for the time being, which gave the day a sense of magic. The birds flew among the shining gaps in the clouds, their outlines dark against the shining sky. And as the gentle breeze carried the clouds along their celestial journey, the sky seemed to be repainted every minute.",
        " \"Excuse me,\" he said in a low voice, and withdrew his hand. A hand on my shoulder made me jump, and my heart sank, I whirled around, and looked at Marcus standing behind me, his face grim in the dim light. I felt my heart beating, and laid my hand on my breast. \"What do you want here?\" His eyes darted toward the end of the corridor. \"I was, but I thought I heard something,\" he answered. Both of us stood there shivering and scarcely breathing. The floor creaked somewhere beyond us. \"There's someone else here, Emilia.\" \"We've got to get out of here,\" murmured Marcus, his fingers finding mine in the darkness. \" Now.\" The old clock chimed once, and its notes rang out in the empty rooms like a warning. But, as we turned toward the staircase, the door, which we had not noticed, slowly opened, and a pale light shone forth from the yellowish radiance of the fading carpet. I saw in the door the person whom I had not expected to see in this house.",
        " I squinted through the glasses, which I had adjusted for the glare of the morning. The white mass was moving, but not with the normal rhythm of the sea. “To arms!” I shouted, my voice resounding across the deck. The stoker—Matthews by name—staring at me, gaping. “Make ready to turn!” I told him. “Take another look, son. What’s the matter, captain?” the men asked, hurrying to their posts. I watched the white mass get larger, and it moved with a slow, ponderous, and even sluggishness that made my skin tingle despite the heat of the tropics. “That’s not a wave!” I said. The mass had risen higher, now a wall of foam that defied the laws of gravity, and in it I saw forms, deformed forms, faces perhaps, or only an optical illusion. “I’ve sailed these seas for thirty years,” I said quietly, “and I’ve only ever seen this phenomenon once before.” Matthews swallowed hard. “They call it a storm-healer,” I said, taking back the glasses. “Locals say it comes before a storm, attracted by vessels like ours.” “But what about the forecast?” I cut him short. “Look at the barometer.” The needle was falling sharply. “Captain,” came First Mate Holloway’s voice, “I can’t help feeling this is a mistake.” The white mass kept coming, so close now that we could hear it, a sound like distant singing, strange and beautiful. The sky was darkening at the edges, forming a few small clouds where none had been a few minutes before. I took a last look at the approaching phenomenon. “Brace the ship and get ready to go full steam ahead,” I said. “Orders?” “There are no more orders. We’ll face what comes together.”",
        " ‘Wait a minute!’ I cried in dismay, springing up in alarm and allowing the bowl of flakes and milk to slide down my shirt, producing an impressive Jackson Pollock of dairy and corn on my underclothes. The knocking resumed, more urgent this time. ‘Wait a minute!’ I cried again, hastily dabbing at the mess with whatever was at hand – a magazine which immediately got all soaked and useless. I opened the door, trying to hide the exploded bowl of flakes, leaving a trail of crumbs in my wake, and looked out of the peephole: my neighbour, Mrs Hendricks, with a tray, which looked like a type of bouillon, and a face that indicated that this was no social visit. ‘Hello,’ I said, with an air of a casualness that belied my milky situation, ‘it seems I caught you at breakfast.’",

        " As you try to get your bearings on this new planet, you will see that it is a strange land. The crystal formations sparkle with a pale blue light, the twin suns cast luminous, prismatic shadows, and the air smells strangely of spices and minerals. You will soon see that the inhabitants are human in form, with crystalline skin that is sometimes marked with abstract designs resembling mathematical formulas. Their many-faceted eyes shift color as they look at you, and they greet you with an expression of interest and curiosity. In the distance you see geometric buildings that seem to defy gravity and soar upwards into the azure sky. A few of the inhabitants come toward you, and you understand what they are saying in the rhythm of their speech. You will want to stay in this strange new land for a while, what will you do?",
        " The Daily Divine has been a tradition at Writing Prompts for some time. The writing prompts community members have grown accustomed to a daily divine prompt, which is a constant feature in the ocean of time travel, superheroes and apocalyptic prompts. There is no way to know when it started. The prompts themselves vary widely. One day God decides to retire, and you are chosen as his replacement. In the end, every religion is partially correct. You die and meet God, who looks exactly like you always imagined. You come to realize that everyone sees the divine as they themselves see it. The afterlife is run by a committee. The moderators have investigated, but haven’t found anything suspicious, just that people with similar interests in prompts keep popping up. It is most curious that there is no consistent pattern in the usernames. The Daily Divine prompts are always written by different users, often accounts with no other activity. Perhaps the most curious part of it is that some people comment that it helped them through a spiritual crisis or that it gave them peace of mind in difficult times. Others see it as an opportunity to explore the philosophical issues of life. The moderators have no way of knowing if this is deliberate or coincidental. Is it something more mysterious? The writing prompts community debates the issue. But one thing is certain, the next day a new prompt on the subject of the divine will appear on time.",
        " “The Journey of the Little Ones: Where do babies come from, and where do they go? How small, how tiny! Into the warmth and love of the heart, Like stars twinkling on the sky. To the parents’ deepest dreams and fondest wishes. The mother surely knows!” For nine months they float in their mother’s womb, developing their little bodies and spirits. When the new baby is born, it’s an incredible event—just like seeing an eagle soar into the air and see the whole world on its feet. Where will they go? They will go a long way, forming their own personalities as they go. With tiny fingers, button nose, And the perfect ears and toes.” Each child is born with a world within, the whole world to discover, the whole sea to cross, all the way to the end of the rainbow. And as they grow up, with their tiny fingers, they will take their first steps, walking through different realms.",
        " The nursery, which had remained empty for so long, was now filled with lullabies and midnight caresses. After years of trying to get pregnant, the couple adopted a beautiful baby girl, whom they named Lily. On the day they brought her home, they were filled with joy and relief, and at last they felt that their family was complete. Of course, they had to adjust to their new life with a child. Sleep was a luxury, and they discovered that looking after a child requires a lot more energy than they had thought. Friends who had witnessed their long struggle gave them a celebration at which photographs show the couple beaming with happiness. Occasionally, as they looked at her sleeping in her cradle, they thought how their lives had come full circle. They had no plan, but things had happened exactly as they were meant to. The difficulties were soon forgotten, and they watched Lily grow and develop, her first smiles, her first steps, the way she reached for them when she was afraid.",
        " The words \"Please continue\" at the end of this paragraph seem to imply that it might be the opening of a letter written by you, or part of a dramatized letter which you would like me to continue in the same voice. It seems to be the opening of a letter dated 1943, which seems to be addressed to someone called John who has lost a loved one, and begins with an acknowledgment that the two of them are strangers and yet bound by their grief, because the two have buried their loved ones under \"the same stones.\" But is it this letter you have in mind, or something else? Do you wish me to go on writing this letter, as though I were the original author?",
        " Above me, the hum of the lamps flickered, buzzing like a plague of insects trapped in amber. I hate this room. I hate this job. The walls are painted a sickly cream colour that might have been bright once, but now they’re stained with the stains of countless conversations long forgotten. My chair squeaks as I move it, a reminder of the time I’ve spent here and of the minutes my life ticks away, one every fifteen minutes. My desk is piled with paperwork that never gets done, no matter how many hours I spend slouched over it. There’s a smell of old coffee and resentment in the air. The window, if one can call that small, grubby rectangle of glass a window, only lets you see the brick wall of the building next door, which sometimes I’ll stare at, counting the bricks, imagining what might be on the other side. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be passionate about something, to get up in the morning with a sense of purpose rather than dread. My colleagues shuffle past, not looking at me, each of them trapped in their own private purgatory, surrounded by deadlines and failure.",

This can be worrying and I’d like to help, but I need more context about what you mean by “after it happened.” Would you be willing to share more details? It would help me to be able to suggest more appropriate support and information for you. There are lots of reasons for gaps in people’s memories—head injuries, illness, stress, and traumatic events, for example.”",
        " People hurried along the sidewalks, huddled under their umbrellas which were of little use against the heavy downpour. It had been raining, more than for some time, that day; the streets were like rivers, the gutters were flowing and the water collected in all the depressions of the pavements. The rain, which fell in bucketfuls, continued unabated. In the streets, in front of the bookstalls, where she was sheltered by an awning, Sarah was watching the heavy rain with a mixture of irritation and resignation. One of the booksellers came out of the shop with a paper bag around his neck, a rainproof for the purchase he had made. He smiled at Sarah and noticed her unhappiness with a pity. He asked her, holding out his big black umbrella: \"Are you out of shelter? I'm going to the Place de Grève. You want to go with me? I find it very sad to let half of this umbrella go to waste. \" Sarah hesitated, remembering the good words her mother had spoken to her, but something in his eyes, kind, with little laughs on their corners, made her decide easier than she expected.",
        " “I’m just doing my job, Chinta. Anyone could have worked it out sooner or later.” Jane blushed and gently ducked her head away from the little man’s touch. “Not just anyone,” Chinta said, and his voice struck that strange musical note that humans found so pleasing. The tall Xorlaxian’s skin was patterned with the peculiar creases that had come to represent a particular mood for him, and his large iridescent eyes blinked with their strange slanting motion. “Not just anyone.” Jane shrugged and looked back at the holographic display, where symbols from both their languages were floating about in a complex web of connections. “For three whole cycles your scientists were baffled by our system. Let’s go on with the cultural exchange. I’d be very interested to learn about your seasonal festivals.” Chinta’s little cheek-puffs drooped slightly in a gesture that Jane now realized was an indication of reflection.",
        " My head swung instinctively; I drew back my arm, my eyes staring, widened, and he stared back at me, the man who only a few seconds ago, when I thought him a docile man, seemed tame and quiet. His unexpected bite, piercing my arm with a needle, sent a sharp, tearing pain along it. His eyes were gleaming with a savage fire, a triumph of despair. I quickly examined the now frayed strap. It had given enough to give him enough play to pull the taser. “We were making progress,” I said, my disappointment showing in my voice, “but we’ll have to start all over again with the conditioning protocol.” With the taser on the tray at my side, I held myself back, I reached for the tranquilizer. Perhaps that was why he had been chosen. His slash pounded, I prepared the injection, thinking about how to revise the restraint protocol.",
        " On the morning of that day the sky was clear, a vast, bare, blue, horizonless expanse. It was one of those historic moments that are remembered for years, and when everyone, years later, will recall with apprehension the place where they were at the time. It was as though all time had stood still for a moment, so that everyone could see at once, in a suspended moment, that what was about to happen was going to be recorded in the history books. People had gathered from early in the morning, some had even slept there overnight, a throng of expectant faces. Nobody could have foreseen the sequence of events that would follow. Some wept in open dismay, others stood mute and in a state of astonishment. First came the flash of light, then a noise which seemed to pass through the air itself. Cameras snapped madly, but the significance of the moment could not be conveyed by the pictures. Broadcasters writhed and froze as they reported. Children pointed to the sky while their parents tried to explain the meaning of the sight. This was one of those moments that divide time into before and after, that leave their mark on a generation. In homes throughout the country the telephones began to ring, as people called their relatives and loved ones. The experience, even for those who were present, was something that needed to be shared.",
        " ‘Paper-mâché,’ said forensic expert Chen, crouching by the fragments. The mask lay on the ground in pieces, all almost uniformly reddened with blood. Inspector Moran stared at it, not wanting to disturb the scene as the forensic experts went about their methodical work. He scanned the spray of blood, which seemed to lead from the mask to the doorway. ‘ Handmade. And, it seems, ripped to pieces by a violent hand.’ he said to Detective Inspector Wang. ‘Nothing definite. But the trail of blood leads us to think that the victim was either dragged away or carried away.’ ‘This mask looks like it belongs to the theatre across the road. They reported that there was a break-in last night.’ Chen gestured to the spray of blood. Moran’s mobile phone rang, his colleague’s text on it: ‘Injected drug; victim in stable condition. Theatre masks stolen.’ Moran pocketed the phone and took one last look at the mask, not on any programme he had ever seen. ‘ Your colleague wants to talk to you.’ ‘Bring it on,’ he said. ‘I think we’ve just got a witness.’",
        " All that was needed was a small bag and a stick of wood carved from a rowan tree. The villagers spoke of him in hushed tones, for though he was neither rich nor great, he was more than wise for his age. Others claimed that he gathered rare herbs for healing that not even the village doctor knew of. What he did, no one knew. One day in autumn, when a layer of red leaves lay over the forest floor, a child fell ill in the village. The doctor tried all his remedies, but the fever only rose higher, like the unforgiving summer sun. The old people whispered among themselves that he was looking for the path that would lead to another world, where time would not exist. Do you wish I would continue the tale? The mother of the child ventured, in desperation, to the young man’s humble cottage.",

        " “Another one,” the detective muttered, answering at once. The phone buzzed again. Not the usual ringing, but a special signal, the one used for the really mysterious cases. The voice on the other end was calm, but urgent. “There’s a situation downtown, the bomb squad’s getting nowhere.” Twenty minutes later, the detective stood in front of an elaborate apparatus connected to a standard digital timer. Except that the timer had a strange appearance, and its connections were not as usual. “They’ve never seen such an encryption.” The detective knelt down and examined not only the timer, but the environment around it. “They’ve tried every possible method,” the squad’s chief explained, wiping the sweat from her brow. “It’s an encryption... like we’ve never seen before.” Why here? Why now? The site was also important. The location was the site of an old bank building that was about to be demolished. The case of the device itself contained some markings, which had been invisible until now, but were matched to the pattern of the signature of the architects who had drawn up the plans for the building. “Did they check the history of the building?” the detective asked, already pulling out a small black light. “It’s a timer for the safe, ” the detective said, “Someone’s trying to open a forgotten safe deposit box, before it’s torn down.” “How did you know?” The squad’s chief remained skeptical until the detective had carefully traced the connections to a hidden panel, which, when activated, would uncover the door to the old vault. “It’s a decryption procedure.” “You know, sometimes the most dangerous threats are only the most elaborate distractions from something a lot simpler,” the detective smiled. The case unfolded, layers of deception, so complex, even the experts could not understand them.",
        " We froze, because Officer Darrell Park’s stern voice boomed out. Everyone remained still, not knowing what had prompted the officer’s sudden command. One hand on his weapon, the other firmly pressed against his hip, he stared at the scene with expert eyes. As he carefully stepped forward, he examined the faces of the unmoving crowd. “Nobody move,” he repeated in a voice that was still, but forceful, “and keep your hands where I can see them.” “I’m going to need some answers,” he continued, and with his eyes fixed on the crowd, “and I need them right away.” His expression remained inscrutable as he analyzed the situation and figured out his next move.",
        " A great burden of guilt was on my chest; every step I had taken between their lives left invisible footprints, deceptions that no excuses or time could erase. I see you have shared a fragment of what seems to be a piece of creative writing, and have asked me to continue the narrative. I am happy to pick up your evocative introductory words, and to continue them in my own style: I was standing alone, staring into the morning light that came through dusty blinds into the empty flat; pictures, formerly on the walls, had been removed, leaving only pale patches on the painted walls. I stood there in the darkness, watching as the gap between us widened. Perhaps, it was not meant to be; perhaps the remission was not meant for people like me who drew the fire towards them and then remained surprised when everything burned. But still, I did not give up. I snatched my fingers and ran them over the ethereal remnants of memories; it was all I had. I could not change what I had done, but perhaps I could find the antidote to it.",
        " \"I thank you for having come at such short notice,\" he began, without lowering his voice, in spite of the importance of what he was about to announce. The room was silent, and a group of expectant faces, and pens at the ready, awaited the remark. Dr. Jackal paused to adjust his glasses, while the last of the reporters was taking his seat. \"As you know, our study group has been investigating the peculiarities revealed in the samples brought back from the station. I regret to have to tell you that our results are... disturbing.\" We have noticed a rapid cell regeneration, and an adaptation... \" The report trembled slightly in his hand. \"I wish to make it clear that we are dealing with something new, whether it is an evolution or... something else.\" Dr. Jackal paused, and met the stares of the assembled journalists, who varied between scepticism and alarm. \" Several hands went up, and I could not answer them all at once.\" He remained standing, while the first questions were asked.",
        " The fog had settled on the graveyard in the morning, wreathing the headstones in ghostly white. He was walking, holding the package, as he approached the grave, which weighed down his arms with an unbearable weight that at the same time was precious. The small plot lay at the top of a hill, under an old oak tree. The newly dug earth was heaped up by the grave, black against the dewy grass. He walked very slowly, with a step that seemed to him very slow, as if to delay the inevitable. He knelt slowly, his knees sinking into the soft earth. The package contained all that was left of their dreams, the letters, the little hat, the sonogram, its phantom. He waited, feeling the package, wrapped in the rags she had just finished making, move in his arms. \"I brought it,\" he said, in a low voice that broke the silence of the cemetery, \"I brought it, I kept my word.\" Things too precious to be buried with her, but too painful to keep at home, in the empty nursery. He traced the letters with his fingers, felt the cold of the stone under his fingernails. The tombstone was simple, made of granite, her name still seemed so strange, wrongly carved on this eternal and impregnable face.",
        " The mountain lasted four days, four days of suffering, four days of exhaustion. My hands were rubbed raw, my legs were trembling with fatigue, and my lungs were burning with every gasp for air. At last, as I reached the summit, the clouds were lifted by divine decree, and in an instant, the spectacle that unfolded before me made all the suffering vanish. The path, if it could be called a path, had been a stout trial of my resolve. I sank on a boulder, my muscles were screaming with fatigue, and I took out from my bag the small metal box with the wrinkled photograph of my grandfather taken at this very spot sixty years ago. Ancient glaciers, forests like emerald carpets, distant peaks, all bathed in a golden light. Here, with tears icing my cheeks, I at last understood. He had said that I would understand when I reached here.",
        " Sometimes happiness is spontaneous and then it is consciously sought out by gratitude exercises, meditation, by connecting to others, by finding meaning in everyday life. You're trying to be happy and that's very good. The fact that you're trying to be happy is a sign of both self-esteem and a certain amount of toughness. What kind of things have you found that can make you feel happy, even for a short time? Or do you have some difficulties that make it difficult to feel happy at the moment? Happiness is also difficult to achieve against obstacles such as depression, anxiety or difficult circumstances.",
        " The official reason for his resignation was a personal problem. However, rumors of a possible disagreement with the highest authorities concerning certain recent decisions were circulating among his colleagues. Even those who had worked for years with him were surprised at his sudden departure. His resignation was particularly curious, as it came just weeks before the start of a major project that he had been working on for the past two years. He had accompanied the introduction of a number of new, forward-looking projects, especially with regard to analyzing information and interdepartmental cooperation, based on the methodical and precise methodology that he was applying to all his managerial tasks. In the weeks following his resignation, he kept a low profile and did not want to answer questions about his future plans and the circumstances surrounding his departure. His successor, appointed from within the organization, faced the difficult task of continuing his predecessor's achievements and establishing their own leadership.",
        " I was eight years old when I first got lost here. Mom had told me not to wander far from the camp. I was about to follow the rabbit I saw through the path. At first the sun shone brightly, but as the hour drew nearer the sun grew lower and the shadows stretched over the forest floor and strange voices filled the void. The friendly trees looked like giants now. The first tears welled up in my eyes as I called out for my parents. I could not remember which way I had come. All paths were the same. I sat on a fallen oak, my knees drawn up to my chest, as the darkness gathered round me. I heard owls, the rustling of leaves, the creaking of branches like footsteps. My voice was small, and there was so much of the forest around me. I was cold, hungry, and scared when the morning finally came. I imagined bears, wolves, and worse beasts watching me from the darkness. But with the light came a new determination. I walked and walked, and after an interminable time I heard voices in the distance calling my name. I remembered what Dad had told me—follow the water downhill.",
        " It was not his bedroom. Blinking quickly, he tried to see his surroundings, and the unfamiliar ceiling above him became clear—it was a cream color, with spider-web cracks. The faint smell of disinfectant hit him, and he heard the soft, rhythmic beeps of a nearby monitor. A thin sheet wrapped his waist, and his legs dangled over the side of the bed, which looked like a hospital bed. Tom turned around and saw a woman in a medical gown, who was getting up from a chair in the corner, a sheet of paper in her hand, and a knowing look of concern and comfort on her face. “Where am I?” “Easy there,” came a soft voice from the left. The last thing he remembered was... what exactly? “What happened?” Tom asked, his voice dry with disuse. The nurse came closer, “You’ve been through a lot.” His brain was muddled, and his memories seemed to hover just beyond his grasp, like shadows that were trying to flee from the light. “How are you feeling?” She checked the instruments next to his bed. “The doctor will be here soon to explain everything to you.” “I don’t know,” Tom replied honestly. “I don’t know how I got here.” He ran his hand through his hair, noticing a sling that was wrapped around his wrist, but Tom had not seen it before.",
        " On the big screen before her peers a bold statement: “Chaos is merely order we haven’t yet understood.” Chaos. The very word seemed to stand for primordial uncertainty, an unpredictable mathematical wilderness where all patterns faded into unpredictability. Years of established theory—Lorenz’s butterfly, the sensitivity of the initial conditions—all this rested on the assumption that true chaos was possible only in deterministic systems. And now Voss was saying otherwise. The auditorium fell silent. Professor Hamlin got up, his voice grim with disbelief. “What we perceive as chaos may simply be our inability to understand order on higher dimensions,” she said, pulling up a screen full of fractals—which looked random at first but then resolved into an elegant pattern when the viewer stepped back from them. “I don’t say ‘abandon,’” Eleanor corrected him. “Transcend. You’re suggesting we... you’re saying we should abandon sixty years of chaos theory because of... of what? A philosophical reframing?” And she displayed her equations, which had turned the room from one of rejection to one of restless consideration. “My algorithms can see order in chaotic systems when we view them on a seven-dimensional phase space.” If she was right, the universe would be far more ordered than anyone had dared hope. What if the very things that make up the world—economics, weather, quantum mechanics—held some of the keys to predicting it?",

        " I shufflingly shuffled into the hallway, without any effort to arrange my hair or dress myself. Whoever was brave enough to disturb my Sunday sleep deserved to meet me in my morning attire. Who rang at seven o'clock on a Saturday morning? I called out in a voice still raucous with sleep. The ringing of the bells began again, this time more insistent. I had not ordered anything and certainly not something that required an early morning signature. Through the spyhole I saw a delivery man with a large package, who was impatiently looking at his watch. \"Wait!\" I scolded. The delivery person, a young lady with a very cheerful smile for the time of day, consulted a sheet of paper. \"Do you know what time it is?\" I opened the door with a frown. \"Good morning! Are you Mrs. Jensen?\" \"Special delivery,\" she said and held the sheet of paper out to me. \"Yes,\" I answered with suspicion, \"but I didn't order anything.\" \"Please sign here.\" And while I was signing, she added: \"The sender has paid extra for the morning call. He said it was extremely important that you got it today.\" \"Who's from?\" I asked. No sender's address, just my name and address written in a clear block. It was surprisingly light as she handed me the package. \"Is it your department?\" I asked. The courier shrugged. I closed the door with my foot and carried the mysterious package to the kitchen table with great curiosity. I had not finished my questions when she had walked down the sidewalk again, but I must be able to say good-bye. So what could be so important that someone had paid extra to get it delivered early in the morning?",
        " - What the...? He murmured and instinctively pushed his chair back. He was looking at the colorful package of Jelly Belly which was somehow strangely hovering in the air and turning around slowly, as if being examined by invisible hands. He stretched out his hand to catch the strangely floating treat and was surprised when it gently landed on his palm. The jar continued its impossible dance and rose higher and higher, and he looked around the office to see if his colleagues had done a prank, but they were all at their monitors, ignoring the supernatural sweet show at his place. On examining the jar, he noticed a piece of paper with a penciled note written on it between the candies, through the transparent plastic, he read the wording: Follow the red ones. It seemed to be a normal package of candies, but it had just defied gravity. The jelly beans inside started to shuffle and align, the red ones repositioned themselves as an arrow pointing to the escape door.",
        " Between these soaring heaps of colored metal, narrow alleys, the labyrinth of which the wind alone was master, formed a labyrinth in which only the wind was free. Abandoned and disused cars reached to the sky, their bodies dulled by time and weather, whose reds had turned to rust, the blues to a gray ashen by the slow predation of nature. Some of them leant, with a wild prodigality, on others, forming sculptures of a strange form. Little beasts, in the terrifying silence of this machine cemetery, inhabited the engine compartments and the glove compartments. Tires, which, once carrying these vehicles on roads and alleys, now sank into the soft earth, unwittingly planting a few persistent weeds that pierced the corroded surfaces. The setting sun cast long shadows between these metal monuments, and, on this spectral horizon, the dereliction of this scrapyard took on an almost beautiful desolation. A family of field mice had taken refuge in the hollow of a once lorry, while some birds had nested in the awnings of a convertible.",
        " After retiring from professional ball-playing, Kareem-Al-Jabbar stayed active in the game, both as coach and mentor. That was perfectly natural. Let me continue our story after his retirement. In addition to his continued professional involvement in the game, he’s been involved in other fields of endeavor as well. For instance, between the early nineties and mid-nineties, he was a coach for the Los Angeles-Clippers and the Seattle Supersonics. In 2005, he was an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers, where he helped develop the young center Andrew Bynum. And he became a respected cultural and political commentator, penning columns for the likes of TIME and the Washington Post, on issues such as race, religion, and politics in the United States. In addition, he became a prolific writer, completing over sixteen books, both historical and fictional, including Brothers in Arms, about the 761st Tank Battalion during World War II, as well as several of his own autobiographies and some even inspired by the adventures of one of the greatest fictional detectives of them all, Sherlock Holmes. “Last but not least, he was appointed by the Secretary of State, the Honorable Hillary-Rodham-Clinton, as a cultural ambassador to the United Nations in May of the year 2012. He also became involved in numerous charitable causes, including his own Skyhook Foundation, which aims to encourage children to develop an interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. “In June of the year 2016, President Obama awarded him the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. “He continues to be involved in the social and political arena, in the struggle for justice and equality, and to advocate for the pursuit of knowledge. “In all his post-basketball endeavors, he has demonstrated a profound commitment to education and the promotion of social justice.",
        " The bullet flew past my ear, so close that I could feel the air stir up my hair, and I instinctively threw myself on the ground, my heart pounding. I'd be glad to take this one step further, as I've begun to do, and I have this idea: I have analysed hundreds of cases, I have compiled countermeasures, I have trained people—and here I am, in the middle of the street, with my face glued to the floor. Ten years of security consulting couldn't prepare me for this. The cold marble of the bank wall was pressed against my cheek, and shouts rang out around me. A professional voice—not amateurs. \"Don't move!\" The man with the gun was not coming towards the tellers, but looking out across the crowd of hostages. I carefully turned my head to try and figure out what was going on, and I realized that this was no bluff. And then I realized that it wasn't a robbery at all—it was something much more personal. And then his eyes settled on mine.",
        " If you would like me to answer in a more creative way, I would be glad to do so, but I should point out that I would have to assume a completely fictional character and the involvement of a criminal who is fictional. Your question is a very brief and open one. What you are asking me to do is to write a short fictional narrative about someone who went to jail during the period of full-service gas stations. Do you want me to: 1. Create a short fictional narrative about someone who went to jail during the period of full-service gas stations? 2. Explain the historical context of full-service gas stations in the United States? 3. Give you a detailed history of full-service gas stations? 4. Start a different discussion on some other topic that interests you? What do you prefer?",

I want to be sure I understand what kind of continuation would be most useful to you.... A character’s vindication after not being believed?... Or something else entirely?",
        " She had another name once, one that was familiar and intimate, a name that told her history in its syllables. Her name now is the Witch. Vuen knows that she hates it because her face changes at the name—a strangely pulled-down look comes over her mouth and eyes. But she accepts it. Vuen watches her through the branches of the trees, the Witch stalking through her garden, letting her fingers brush the leaves, so closely do they cling to her. But the name she had then was swept away in the burning of the village, like ashes that drifted over the cold country where she was stranded. The villagers come to her with their pain and fears, with their broken things and their broken promises. Her garden grows lush and beautiful, full of plants that have no business growing in this country. When she’s alone, she slumps her shoulders a little, as if the burden of her name presses on them. Vuen has seen her sit, alone, waiting until they’ve gone, then collect their offerings, her fingers trembling as she takes them. They never stay, and they hurry off as soon as they’ve left their offerings on the edge of her clearing. They call her the Witch, and they fear her, but they never look her in the eye. That’s why she tolerates Vuen, though she has never said a word to her, because someone needs to remember her, before she became what they wanted her to be. Only Vuen knows that sometimes she whispers her name to the stars, as if she might forget it.",
        " Today our glorious leader saved a kitten that had fallen out of a tree. It was reported that while the Great Leader was on his usual morning walk through the Central Park he noticed a small, calico kitten hanging on the branch of an oak tree and, without any delay, he threw off his ceremonial coat, rolled up his sleeves and, with extraordinary agility, climbed the tree of thirty feet. The Park visitor, Maria Chen, said: “He had been giving a spontaneous speech on economic policy, but he immediately went half-way up the tree to save the poor creature.” With his compassionate, altruistic heart, he took care not to hurt the frightened kitten, but picked him up by the paw. His action today made it the third case of the month in which he rescued a wounded animal, following his frightened duck family last week and the seal whose rescue and captivity were televised to the whole country. The kitten, which was named Fortune by the staff of the local shelter, has had a thorough medical check-up and is now with a new, loving family.",
        " Tests after tests proved useless. For six months my wife and I had been so concerned. We had been dipping into our savings with each new hospitalization. The specialist doctors shook their heads. Yesterday the phone rang. When the doctor told me they had finally found the illness, and it was curable, I could not speak. I recognized the neurologist’s number and answered it with trembling hands. My wife held my arm and stared into my face. “Is it good news?” she asked in a whisper. Relief overcame me. For the first time since our ordeal we could breathe again. I nodded, tears dripping from my eyes.",
        " You and Evan played a game of pretend-guns, turning your hands into pretend-weapons, and then acting out scenes from books, or making up your own adventure. You could hide behind furniture, proclaim special powers or protection, playfully argue about who “got” you first, point the gun at each other, and make dramatic falls when you were “shot”. This kind of play helps the development of imagination, social understanding and symbolic sensitivity. Many adults have fond memories of such games from their childhood. You might have set up rules about respawns, or safe zones. There may be some aspect of this memory you want to talk about more.",
        " “I’m telling you, Marv, this is the real thing!” The monster lizard strode through the ocean, and in its path were two bumbling idiots with their backs to it, with a belt between them, arguing loudly, and completely ignoring the gigantic reptilian form rising from the waves behind them. “It looks fake to me, Lenny,” Marv replied, trying to grab the belt. “This is a gold mine!” the taller of the two said, waving the gaudy adornment. The huge lizard turned its head to observe the peculiar little humans with their gleaming object. A shadow fell over them, and waves of seawater splashed on the lizard’s scaly legs. “I still don’t understand why we had to steal it here on the beach.” “It’s probably your imagination,” Marv said, still trying to seize the belt. Lenny felt the ground shake. “Did you feel that?” He and Marv slowly turned around, one after the other, and the belt fell from their trembling hands into the shallow water. “Marv, this belt looks fake,” Lenny said, “I don’t think it’s real.” A loud roar interrupted him and sprayed them both with an odor of fish. “I think we ought to reconsider our career plans,” Lenny said. “Lenny?”",
        " The next section of this section will be devoted to a small bus stop near the entrance to the riverside inn. Its seat is a simple green bench, with a few patches of flaking paint. The roof is a metal structure a little bent under the weight of the snow in winter. The place is most crowded in the morning and evening: the city's inhabitants to work, the college students going to college, and tourists, for the sake of the famous Walleye sandwich of the dam-site inn, come here. The schedule, under a smudged plexiglass cover, shows the times of the number 42 bus, which connects this corner of the city with the outside world. During the rest of the day, it is a contemplative place. The twins of the family of the Hendersons often came together after school, sharing their headphones and their secrets, before their mother picked them up at the I Screamers. At dusk, the lone lamp on the roof flickered on, casting a soft light that attracted moths in summer and formed a halo in winter fog. Every Tuesday, the old Mrs. Winters came, even if she was not traveling, just to watch the passers-by. Between the good-natured laughter of the inn and the cheerful doorbell of the ice cream parlor, we feel the rhythm of the community in its pauses and its transitions.",
        " - Worth it? I no longer count in such quantities. The second figure slowly nodded, and his eyes were directed to the distant horizon. “Perhaps that is the point,” said the first at last, and his voice was now lowered. A silence settled between them, broken by the gentle rustling of the foliage. Sometimes, I believe we are caught in a current, carried by long-standing choices. Laughing, the second figure said, if without much humor. “To continue, knowing not its value, and to find meaning in the journey, and not in the promised goal. Isn't that right? Then you'll say that there is beauty in the struggle. Even in the midst of this, I have experienced moments of wonder, men who have reminded me why we continue. The first figure waved his hand wildly about the area. They were silent again, each in his own thoughts, and the light around them began to fade. - People, people - the second figure repeated. - Always our greatest strength and our worst delusion.",
        " Sarah listened, breathless, to hear if there was something in the sound of the water drops, which the echoes of the stone walls were sending back to the ground. The drops fell with a metronomic precision, marking the time in the darkness. Another drop. The damp walls, covered with moss, glistened, a mud-stinking smell of earth and decay filled the air. Sarah took a hesitant step, and her boots splashed in a shallow pool. The rhythm was almost hypnotic. She listened and thought she heard a shuffling, a light breathing that was not hers. The sound seemed to swell, it was deafening, and went down the corridor like a warning. She froze, listening. Drip. Drip. The water continued its measured, tinkling, not troubled by her presence or her fear. Her lamp went on and off a few times, throwing a whirling light over the curved ceiling. Drip. The natural clock was counting down, and she did not know what it was. The rattling light in the tunnel seemed to breathe.",

        " “I’m sorry I’m late,” he said, squeezing into the seat across from me. He wore a perfect charcoal gray suit that seemed out of place among the plastic chairs and the shiny menus. He entered, and the bell above the door jingled. “Traffic was hell on the 405.” His voice sounded astonishingly normal. He smiled at his own joke. “What can I get you, Mr. Morningstar?” The owner behind the counter nodded at him with friendly respect. I’d never expected the prince of darkness to be a regular at a gyro place or to order for me so casually. “Please, Dimitri, my friend wants a gyro.” “Why here?” I finally asked. But then, nothing about our meeting had gone according to my expectations. “It’s the best tzatziki in town. And a neutral place.” He unfolded the napkin to his fork and knife. “So now,” he said, delicately cutting his gyro, “let’s discuss your proposal.” Dimitri had returned with two steaming plates and a knowing wink. “People are less... suspect when they’ve eaten well.”",
        " \"A diversion? What is your plan?\" And Dave raised an eyebrow and leaned forward to hear the faintly murmured prayer. Before answering, Sarah looked around the coffee-house with an air of preoccupation. \"It's his birthday next weekend, and I've organized a surprise party for him. \" There was a note of merriment in his voice. \"Ah, I see, \"nodded the author, sipping his coffee. \"Is there anything you can think of that you can do to divert him? \" He grinned. \"That's the thing, Dave; you could invite him to that climbing wall you've been talking about; he seemed to be very interested in it.\" Sarah's eyes lit up a little. \"Alright, that's good. What time do you want him out of the house?\" \"Then it's done. You're a real find, Dave.\" \"About noon would be perfect, the guests are expected at three o'clock,\" answered Sarah, obviously relieved. \"Do you want me to bring something for the party when we come back?\" \"I'm glad to help.

        " When a puppy first sees its heavenly friend, it gazes at the face of a creature who has known the vicissitudes of countless seasons and who will remain virtually unchanged while generations of our own race come and go. They are our Celestial Ones, the beings who have graced our world for as long as half a millennium. For us they are like towering giants whose slow and stately progress through the vastness of time we call the Celestial Ones. They are possessed of mysterious powers beyond our ken, for they apportion food without hunting, create warmth without fire and travel impossible distances in their strangely mobile lairs. One of these celestial friends may even be watching over the great-great-great-grandchildren of its first earthly companion. Yet even the most fortunate among us can only see but a fraction of their endless journey. Their wisdom is a source of great wonderment for us, and it is no surprise that we welcome them with such delight, even when they have been away for only a few hours. It is not hard to see why some of us think that they control the weather, for their magic hands and their strange-smelling balms often bring rain before the clouds gather. When we are chosen by one of these Celestial Ones, we live our lives in devoted service to them, guarding their lairs and offering our friendship in the brief moments of their long lives.",
        " The king’s hand trembled slightly as he pressed down on the ancient scroll, the parchment of which had yellowed with age. “You are making fun of this, my son?” Prince Horace said, glancing at his aging father. “No, father, I am not making fun of it. It is simply...” His voice was weary, but it still had the imperious command that had ruled his kingdom for forty years. “After all these years of insisting that our northern territories were worthless, now you are saying they are the key to our survival. It is an unexpected proposition.” Horace approached the throne and his polished boots made a hollow sound on the marble floor. “I have said what was necessary to prevent bloodshed, to prevent ambitious men like yourself from getting us into a war we could not afford.” The king’s eyes, now dimmed with cataracts, but still clear of mind, narrowed. “And now?” The few courtiers in the throne room exchanged anxious glances. Outside the tall windows, the skies grew dark with stormclouds, and the atmosphere of the chamber reflected it. “It is high time, my son, that you should learn the true history of our family,” King Alaric said, unfurling the scroll, which displayed a map whose symbols Horace had never seen before. “Is this the secret of our forefathers’ death?” Horace asked, ignoring the charge, his voice still respectable, in spite of the accusation. “And this is the burden you will have to bear, when this crown passes to you?”",
        " I thought at first that all people experienced this phenomenon. But all my life I have been intrigued by memories that are not mine, memories that come to me in fragments; I think of a stone cottage I have never been to, the smell of bread baking in an unfamiliar kitchen, the touch of hands long and aged, though I am young. I had never watched a film about pirates. In kindergarten I said to my teacher, “I remember going across the ocean in a wooden ship.” She smiled and asked me, “What film?” I had never seen a film, but I knew the sensation of a toga being wrapped around my body, the feeling of having a coat of mail over my shoulders in a Middle Ages battle, the fear of hiding in a cellar as bombs fall overhead. And as I grew older, these memories became more precise; I recalled specific words and sentences in languages I had never learned. My parents took me to psychiatrists, neurologists, and hypnotherapists, all of whom could not explain my precocious memories. None of their explanations satisfied me. In my college days I learned about quantum physics and theories of consciousness and developed my own hypothesis. Perhaps the neural connections in my brain made it possible for me to tap into a larger memory pool. Perhaps the memory was not stored only in my brain, but in the fabric of the world, and perhaps it was possible to enter into the memory of others. I felt certain that I was not alone in this experience. I was sure that others like me, who had been collecting these memories and living lives that were not theirs, existed. I hoped to find them.",
        " The maintenance department has informed us of a major clog in section 13-E of the New Albion sewers, occurring at the very early hour of this day. This is the third blockage in this area during the last month. On inspection, the obstruction was found to consist of a conglomeration of industrial and domestic waste, forming a fatberg some 2.3 meters in diameter. The blockage was removed by means of high-pressure water jets and mechanical cutting devices, allowing the flow of waste to resume. Of particular interest, the cleaning crew discovered several unusual objects in the waste:—Several waterproof devices (damaged beyond recovery)—Various sheets of synthetic polymer with partial markings resembling shipping manifests—Traces of chemical compounds not normally found in domestic waste—Made it possible for inspectors to identify, with precision, the source of the clog. To be tested by the local laboratory. We hereby recommend:——Increase inspection frequency for section 13-E to biweekly——Install additional monitoring devices at section 12-D and section 14-A——Deploy a third-party surveillance mechanism in the area——Otherwise, complete and immediate isolation of section 13-E—— Maintenance manager, O. B. Jenkins, has requested additional manpower for the next scheduled inspection——Investigate any unreported industrial dumping in the northeast quadrant",
        " A man was standing before the gate with a book in his hand, neither a man nor a woman but both and neither, and the serenity which the man radiated from his calm was at once calming and terrifying to Randall. “Well, this is... unexpected,” he muttered, squinting at the golden archway, which was at once so material and so ethereal that he was really at a loss to explain it to himself. “It’s me,” he answered, and then winced at the banality of his reply. “Randall Mercer,” the man said. It wasn’t a question. “You look surprised.” The man smiled. Forty-seven years of contemplating life’s great philosophical questions, and in the moment of cosmic truth he couldn’t come up with a more profound answer. “I have spent my entire adult life straddling the fence, Randall,” the man said, and Randall shook his head, gesturing at the gate, at the clouds, at the impossible architecture of eternity. “Wouldn’t you?” The man nodded, thumbing through the pages of his book. “The universe is too vast for certainty,” he would have said. “I wrote a dissertation about the psychological comfort of religious texts without ever being willing to accept their truthfulness.” “Yes, Metaphysical Comfort: The Human Tendency Toward Narrative Construction of the Afterlife, Columbia University, 2003. Quite interesting, actually.” “We keep very detailed records.” “You read my dissertation?” Randall asked. “Your agnosticism is of no consequence. Doubt is not the opposite of faith.” The man smiled more broadly. “That sounds like some cliche I would have dismissed as a religious equivocation,” Randall said, and then he caught himself. “Sorry, I was being flippant.” “There is nothing to apologize for. You lived honestly according to your understanding of the world. Old habits.” The man stepped to the side. “You were kind when you could be. You sought truth as best you could.” The gate began to open. “These Gates have never been a place of judgment, Randall. They are not a barrier to correct belief.”Randall felt a lifetime of carefully constructed philosophical frameworks crumbling around him. \"So what happens now?\" he asked. \"Now?\" The figure gestured toward the light beyond. \"Now you get some answers to those questions you've been asking all your life. Though I suspect you'll find they lead to even better questions.\" Randall took a deep breath and stepped forward, into the mystery he'd spent a lifetime analyzing but never truly believed he'd experience.",

Therin, Maz’s lanky elf companion, put his hand on her shoulder and said in a calming voice, “Maybe this is one of those cases where diplomacy would serve you better than dismemberment.” She snorted. “We’re not here to cause any trouble,” she said, leaning toward the guard. “We’re here because something in your Baron’s gaudy tower has been attracting evil spirits from all around the countryside.

You glimpsed, as your eyes followed the fading lines, a distant valley where time flowed in a different fashion. Since you experienced the peculiar phenomenon of words vanishing after you read them, I will now continue: A new part of the manuscript was about a series of markers. A trio of pillars aligned with the summer solstice, a river whose current varied with the phases of the moon, a grove of trees whose leaves glistened silver in the starlight. The order of these markers must be observed, and then the true path would appear. Scholars have been searching for centuries for these markers, which vanish almost as quickly as they are read.

Old Herr Grumble was even happy, when this time of year was at its best.

        " As a leader, you might think of the following points: When someone reveals how hard it is for him to fall, whether it be through failure, through mistakes or through hard times, it is often a sign of vulnerability and trust. Your colleague has revealed something quite personal about his difficulties or challenges. And in the face of such a revelation, it is important that you respond with empathy, acknowledging the other's openness. In doing so, you can mention some things: 1. your own setbacks as a means of normalizing the experience; 2. the connection between falling and growing; 3. the need for support and help in working through the challenge; 4. how falling can also be a form of learning and growth; 5. and a culture in which mistakes are perceived as learning opportunities. Perhaps you want to talk about how you can respond to that and how you can follow up on this conversation in order to support your team and yet retain your leadership role.",

She fiddled with the hem of her sleeve, her eyes darting everywhere, not at me. The afternoon sun came into the room and her features half disappeared in the shadows. Finally, barely above a whisper, I asked, “What about you? About us? About where we’re going?” “I’ve been thinking a lot lately,” she said, taking a deep breath. “I don’t think...” she started, but then stopped to collect her thoughts. My heart was hammering against my ribs. I had felt something had changed in her in the past few weeks, the changes in her writing, the cancellations of our dates, the silences in our meetings.

        " It had been a long time since the Metro had been built, so long that records of the origin of the Metro were very uncertain; there was no certainty as to the date on which it had opened. Many were the theories of its builders; some claimed that it had preceded the city; others said that it had been secretly built during the war. The truth was lost in the midst of decades of repairs, of extensions, and of bureaucratic changes. Now Maya was investigating the recent power failure in the eastern section. She had been an engineer for fifteen years, navigating its twisted tunnels which seemed to obey a logic of their own. She had found stations that were not on the official map, sections of track which had an impossible obliqueness, and a station platform with a tile design that he could not have placed in any historical period. As she came round a corner, the static of the radio rang out. The failures had been minor: lights had dimmed momentarily, and the signalling system had malfunctioned. With her torch, she was sweeping the curves of the service tunnel, and its walls, old bricks and modern wiring, were in bold relief. Through the white noise, she could almost hear voices, not those of her colleagues in the control centre but of a different order, like recordings playing from a previous era. The signals, in these depths, were always erratic, but this interference was different. She was unable to establish it clearly, but she could feel the past in the service tunnels, the signs of previous repair attempts and the reminders of the Metro’s past. In the distance, she saw a gateway, one she had never seen before, with a keystone with an inscription that she did not understand, and behind it a platform which had not been renovated, with lights which had no power.",

The work is heavy and I do my best to keep up with the others, but my hands are hurting, and I don’t think the manager is very fond of me. They gave me a room at a house called the “Brewer,” and they got me a job bagging groceries at a store called “Foodway.” I keep thinking that Jacob might come by and say hello, but he never does. I hope he’s all right, and that he’s making new friends. I go to the park sometimes after work and feed the birds. At night I have bad dreams—it seems as if I’m falling and I wake up in a panic. Maybe I should just rob the store, and they’ll send me home—and I could shoot the manager too—as a special favor. It takes me a while to figure out where I am. I’m tired of being afraid.

There’s something perversely fascinating about estate sales, like digging through someone else’s garbage and always wondering whether anything of it has any value to the owner or to you. The relatives are huddled nervously, trying to put a price on a lifetime. Twenty dollars for the chair where he spent his final years. The dead can’t tell the difference. Sometimes you find yourself holding something in your hand, a fountain pen, a sweater knitted by his wife, a war medal in a dusty box, and you suddenly feel as though it were sacred. Five dollars for the complete set of encyclopedias that haven’t been opened since 1987. A box of photographs for whatever you think is fair. By the afternoon the house looks gutted. Whatever doesn’t sell will be given away or thrown out. You put it back, ashamed of your intrusion, and then see someone else hurriedly throw it into a “maybe” pile. You wonder what’s going to be left of you, what someone else is going to put out on a folding table for strangers to dig through, your treasures no more distinguishable from your garbage. The family takes what they value, but so much remains.",

I had been out at night with the girls, and it was with a hangover that I was awakened by the blaring alarm. My eyes were huge with sleep and as I stared at the clock I suddenly saw that I had exactly twenty-seven minutes to get to work. It was today, of all days, that my boss had arranged an early meeting with his clients. \"Never again!\" I groaned into my pillow, as I have so often before. The shower helped a little. I got out of bed, and when my feet hit the cold floor I swayed a little. I stumbled over the clothes that lay around me and saw the same face staring back at me in the mirror. The phone buzzed with a text message from Jess: \"You're alive yet, check your story before anyone else sees it.\" While I drank my coffee and tried to get into my clothes, the memories of last night came to me, fragmentary and embarrassing, I remembered dancing on the table, singing at karaoke with strangers and perhaps also giving a number to a bartender with a hawk...

        " On the run I escaped with the starship I stole. I flew it in the quantum wake of the authorities, as my cargo hold filled with relics of ancient civilizations that had been sundered. The stolen starship flew faster than my own, and I used it to reach my final destination. Maybe I would land on a distant moon, where the reach of justice would not soon arrive. But would I be able to outrun the guilt within me? The guilt that burns within me as the stars shine bright, As I soar through endless night. My starship responds to every order, but it is no use. What have I gained by gaining? I know the gravity of my cosmic sin. The thief, the thief who flees to perdition.",
        " The subject of time is one of the most interesting subjects of speculation. Besides the ancient paradox of the grandfather, there are curious variations, such as the bootstrap paradox, where information or material is locked in a causal loop without beginning or end. These thought experiments go beyond mere curiosity. They examine the nature of causality, free will, and whether or not our universe admits closed temporal curves. Some theoreticians, using quantum mechanics, hypothesize parallel time-lines or the self-consistency of Novikov, which prevents any paradox by the laws of probabilities themselves. Stephen Hawking proposed a chronology protection conjecture, according to which the universe will prevent time travel as a fundamental principle to avoid such paradoxes. What are your thoughts on time travel paradoxes? It seems to me that the most important thing is to question the very linear concept of time.",
        " Numbers over people’s heads... It began when I was twelve. Numbers hovering over people’s heads, faint at first, like shimmers of heat. I have never spoken of this before. My grandmother’s number was three. I thought I needed glasses, but then I began to notice the pattern. My teacher’s number was ten thousand five hundred and twelve. I almost read her obituary almost exactly thirty years later. Three months later, she was dead. Sometimes I wish I could stop seeing these numbers. I wish I could turn them off, especially when it’s a person I care about, or a child with a small number. Numbers never lie. The worst part is, I can’t see my own number. I’ve tried to warn people, tried to change their fate, but it’s never worked. The look of terror on people’s faces when they notice me says it all. I met someone else with the same gift yesterday.",

        " Kreth’mar adjusted his breathing apparatus and squinted through his cracked goggles at the distant horizon, where three moons stood together, their faces pitted and broken. Wind blew the dust in waves over the Trilokag’nghzar desert. Skeleton trees stretched toward the crimson sky like beseeching prayers to a forgotten god. The radiation counter on Salia’s wrist began to click with increasing urgency. “We ought not to be here,” Salia whispered in a low voice that could barely be heard over the wind. “The rites start with the rising of the moons.” Kreth’mar shook his head ominously, and clutched the ancient object they had found at the buried temple, its surface quivering with a sickly green light. “Six more kilometers to the gates,” he said, looking at his tattered map. “We might make it in time if we hurry. And the carved symbols at the edges are—” A low rumble interrupted his thoughts. It came not from above but from below. “They’re awakening,” Salia said, her eyes wide with terror. “The Guardians of Trilokag’nghzar are awakening.” A tremor rolled across the sand, and the huge obsidian statues that had stood sentinel for countless centuries began to slowly turn on their pedestals.",
        " She readjusted her glasses. Doctor Fish looked at the curriculum vitae lying on her desk and then at the man sitting opposite her, his face set in a look of determination. She was pensive. “Well, Mr. Jenkins, you certainly seem to be well qualified on paper. A degree from the University of Chicago, four years at Goldman Sachs, and your recommendations speak of your superior analytical abilities. Your body language is also good, as is your sense of style, with your arms casually on the armrests.” “Tell me about a time when you had a difficult time in a project you were heading and how you dealt with it.” His demeanor gave her pause. She watched him carefully, awaiting his reaction.",

        " The alarm clock in the nightstand kept blaring incessantly, pounding like a jackhammer in his skull. Only the cold floor under his face kept him from slipping back into sleep. And yet, he knew better: the last time he had let himself stay in bed for five minutes, he had almost lost his job. “Just five minutes more,” he murmured to no one, but the floor muffled his words. The room spun as he reached for the alarm. A painful groan escaped his lips, and he sat up, painfully, on his knees, and then, leaning on the edge of the bed, he swung himself upright. Coffee. He needed coffee before he could understand anything else. Sunlight streaked through the broken blinds, drawing lines in the rumpled bedclothes. The phone call, which had to have been after midnight. Then, gradually, the events of the night before filtered back into his consciousness. Still groping, with eyes half closed, he made his way to the kitchen. Today was not just any other day. It was the news. That was why he hadn’t slept at all.",
        " The rain is pouring down outside, and the steady patter on the windows fills the otherwise silent hallway of the old-fashioned house. INTERIOR: A hallway during the daytime. And on the floor the sound of one step, the footsteps of a lady in her thirties in a dark suit, which echoes as she steps along toward the staircase. A few feet further on, a curtain falls and we see the house, empty. EMMA (thirties) enters the hall, snatches up her rain-soaked umbrella, and with a shiver of disdain looks around the house, where the house is empty. She reaches into her pocket and takes out an old, brass key. A portrait of a stern-looking man looks down on her from the mantelpiece, but Emma looks away. From upstairs, a faint squeak. The key trembles slightly in her hand. EMMA (whispering): Hello? No answer, just the rain and the creaking of the old house. She stops short and looks up at the second-floor landing. As she begins to climb the stairs, every step seems to groan as if the house is trying to protest her coming.",
        " The alarm woke me. Red lights began to flicker on the ceiling of my room, and my heart was pounding so violently, my pulse raced and my heart sank. I was groping for my boots. The siren blared. “Alert! Breach in section seven! Evacuate immediately!.. .. Not a drill!” I pulled my pressure suit out of the closet, and with trembling fingers, I slid on the clasps. Outside in the corridor, everything was in turmoil. The station was trembling beneath my feet. Another shock? I could see the darkness outside the window, and in it the too large silhouette that shouldn't be there, the surface of which reflected the distant sun with painful brilliance. We weren't alone on the moon anymore. The crewmen were hurrying by, some still in their nightwear, some with emergency breathing apparatus strapped to their faces. Whatever had found us was not waiting for an invitation.",

        " From the ceiling, in dancing, thin streaks, dust fell. A humming vibration passed under my feet, went up through my legs, settled in my chest and pressed me like another heartbeat. I felt something, I was about to scream. A glass of water on the table trembled in concentric circles, as a warning. I stood and listened. The vibration was not only still, but stronger. I shouted: \"Leave, leave now!\" My voice echoed in the growing vibration. Then the lights went out, the emergency lights came on, with a red, sinister flicker. From the doorways confused people came out, then wide-eyed as the house shook with a sickening shock. At the end of the corridor tiles fell down. I looked back, before I stepped into the stairwell, at the office where I had spent countless hours, and saw all the other buildings swaying. We moved as one, and surprisingly orderly, with fear, electricity and tension crackling between us. What happened, whatever it was, nothing was going to be the same again. A crack ran like lightning on the far wall.",
        " He nervously glances at his watch, then back to the door where we came in. ‘We don’t have much time,’ he says in a hurry, looking nervously at his watch and then at the door we came in through. ‘The alarm hasn’t sounded yet, but it may do at any moment. We have to get out before the whole building is sealed.’ He points to the door at the far end of the corridor. ‘ Which way out?’ I ask, looking along the dim corridor. ‘Through there, down to the ground floor, then east to the loading bays, where our contact is waiting with a vehicle.’ The weight of the stolen disk is weighing me down. ‘ Let’s go,’ I say, and we start along the corridor with as soft a tread as we can manage on the concrete floor, the darkness our only friend in this dangerous game. I have to believe it is.",
        " His gavel resounded with a loud crash, resounding through the hushed hall. “I sentence you to death!” the judge intoned. “You have fourteen days to appeal,” he went on, his voice barely able to keep back a slight catch. The condemned man stood, mute, his face pale, as if wrapped in a shroud, while the gallery, behind him, dissolved in a dull sobbing. And the judge took his seat, with his trembling hands, his hands resting on his papers, readying an appeal that might save his client. A guard came from either side, his handcuffs clanking against the silence. “God have mercy on your soul,” the judge concluded. He removed his glasses, and suddenly looked older and more tired than he had a few moments before. Few people could understand the burden of judging. Outside, journalists waited like vultures, ready to catch the condemned man’s first step.",

When was the last time we were really happy together?). “I didn’t realize you felt that way.” “I think part of you does.” “And you don’t want something more, something more, for both of us?” “I’d thought we could get through this.” “But this isn’t a mere patch.

        " The cast, the stars, the high budget, the good advertising, the best-seller was expected to do a great business. It was a major film, it had been predicted by the experts; the stars were shining, the studio hoped to take advantage of the increased popularity of its genre, and the quick djinn were said to be in great demand. The audience, however, was very divided. It was quite a hit or miss, and the opening weekend, though good, was not exactly up to the figures expected by the studio. The film was received with mixed feelings by the critics, some praising the special effects and some of the performances, others criticizing the pacing of the story and the development of the characters. In the end, the studios said that the release period and the competition were too hard for the public to accept the film, and that they had set their expectations too high. The film has changed over time, and has been considered by some as a film of its time, with some of its features being considered ahead of its time. Despite its initial disappointment, the film gradually built up through word of mouth and the international markets, resulting in good, if not spectacular, box office results.",
        " You groan, shading your eyes from the bright light, and the spectral figure notices and with a gentle gesture alters the intensity of the light to a more tolerable intensity. The light dims a little and casts a long shadow. You begin to discern more details of your surroundings. “I apologize,” says the spectral figure in a clearer voice. “I often forget how overwhelming this place can be to newcomers.” The spectral figure, now partially solid, partially transparent, is clad in flowing robes that shimmer like water even though there is no breeze. “You have questions,” says the figure, announcing rather than asking. You see that the chamber is ancient yet timeless. The walls curve outward and are covered with a plethora of mysterious symbols that appear to move when your eyes are off them. The spectral figure stretches out a hand to you, both welcoming and admonishing you. “That is why most find themselves here, unintentionally as it were. The portal is open to those who seek understanding.” “What do you wish to understand?”",
        " Gold is a natural product of the earth; it is formed under the most extreme heat and pressure, in the interior of the earth, where the hot fluids circulate in the cavities of the rock and leave their deposit on the surface. Gold is found on the surface of the earth, near the mountains, in association with quartz and other minerals. The extraction of gold has influenced human history; it has caused great rushes, has established the history of nations, and still occupies a prominent place in the economies of several countries. Gold, which is ten parts in a million of the terrestrial globe, is the rarest metal, and constitutes but a thousandth of the mass of the earth. The principal deposits of gold are found in South Africa, in Australia, in Russia, in the United States, in certain parts of South America, and in Russia, in the United States, in Canada, and in various parts of South America.",
        " Then I slowly woke up, I rolled over and fell asleep, clinging to the last remains of a dream that was already fading from memory. I was dragged out of the sleep in which I had relapsed, and fell asleep again; I was still warm under the blanket. I threw the pillow over my head and had a moment of darkness. The digital clock in the hall was mercilessly displaying 6:47, too early for Saturday and too late to go back to sleep. The sound of birds singing from far away mingled with the quiet buzz of the refrigerator in the hall. I sighed in resignation and turned over on my back and watched the shadows on the ceiling dance. But my mind was already taking stock of the day; the errands that had to be done, the telephone calls to be made, the deadlines on Monday. With every thought I moved further away from sleep and was attached to wakefulness despite my resistance. But I lay still for a few more minutes in the special space between the dream and the day, not wanting to give up everything to the day that had come without my consent. Perhaps coffee could make this early awakening a little more bearable.",
        " The space where you were sometimes still a vacuum, that strange space that opens up when someone who has been with you for so long suddenly disappears. I remember our inexplicable jokes, the gazes we shared through a crowded room. There are still moments when something happens and I want to tell you first of all, an old reflex that time has not yet managed to change. I miss our late night conversations about everything and nothing, how you knew what to say when everything went wrong. I hope you are well, I hope you have found happiness and growth in the path you have chosen. Maybe some friendships are not for all time, but for a certain chapter. I wonder if you remember me too, if you remember us as I do, imperfect, but important. Take care of yourself. Not even this does not make the absence easier.",

        " “Master Barnabus,” sighed the spirit, its voice like a flickering fire. It turned around and its sparkling eyes fixed on the sender of the greeting—a stocky man, with a long, wildly bristling beard, and in ragged, unmatched garments with heavenly devices on them. “Such play-acting from such a small man! There is nothing that vexes me, except the constant demands of men who know little about the elemental powers. The spirit’s countenance remained stern, but there was a flicker of interest in its eyes. Here,” he pulled a small silk bag out of his voluminous sleeve, “I’ve brought dates, from the water market, which you pretend not to like.” “Certainly not,” winked Barnabus, “but I will accept them.” Despite the spirit’s insistence on remonstrance, it slowly approached the wizard. “What about the constellation? Do you want to discuss it or do you want to continue your sulking?”",

I have made my peace with it, I think. I called my sister this morning, and we talked for hours, about everything and nothing. I didn’t tell her it was my last day. I didn’t want to hear her cry. In the afternoon I went through the family albums. It’s strange, how a whole life can be condensed into a few frames—graduations, birthdays, summer vacations. The sunset this evening was extraordinary—a deep, rich orange and purple streaking across the sky. I wish I had taken more pictures of my everyday life. I have such a void between the events. A fitting farewell. I am not afraid any more. I sat by the window and watched until the last rays were gone. If someone ever finds this, please let them know I lived and that I loved you. I’m just sorry about all the tomorrows I’ll miss. But I’m grateful for the life I’ve had and for the people who have loved me.” I have lived, I have loved, I have mattered.",
        " The golden light of the fireplace danced on the faces, froze them in a moment and preserved the moment. The laughter rang in the room, genuine and deep, all those who occupied it were involved, it was a hearty laughter that was passed on from one to another, clinked glasses and faded away into contented sighs and happy smiles. Thomas, still chuckling, refilled their glasses with the red wine that was breathing on the sideboard. Eleanor still wiped tears of joy from her cheeks, her shoulders still trembling a little, as she leaned back in her armchair. The old grandfather clock in the corner struck eleven and caught everyone's attention for a moment, outside the rain was falling, and its quiet, rhythmic patter against the panes made the room even cozier. \"It's nights like this that remind me why we're still having these parties,\" he said in his slightly hoarse voice. \"We still have a whole night in front of us and James promised to tell us something about his last summer trip to the sea.\" - \"Who's ready for a story,\" Margaret asked, tucking her legs under her on the settee.

        " A long shadow of Karl stretched across the sidewalk, lit up behind him by the streetlamp, and he was a formidable-looking figure. Karl stood before me. He was pretty big, and his smirk showed that he knew as well as I did that I couldn't beat him. “Listen, Karl,” I said, trying to speak calmly, “we don't need to get into a fistfight. It won't get us anywhere.” I stepped back, the rough brick wall of the alley pressing against my back. Karl gave a gravelly laugh. “That's funny, isn't it? We'll have to settle this somehow.” He jerked his shoulders around, the leather jacket he was wearing creaking sinisterly. “The boss said you've had more than enough chances.” Karl blocked the exit to the street with his bulky frame, and I saw no way of getting away, as the exit was the only way out of the alley. My mind threw up all sorts of options, none of them good, fighting was out of the question, Karl was about six inches and a stone taller than me and, thanks to all that strength, probably fifty pounds heavier. “What about the money?” I said impulsively, “I could get it by tomorrow, all of it, with interest.” “I know you well enough,” he said, and stepped closer, “you've already heard this so many times it's like a call signal.” Something flickered across Karl's face, hesitancy, perhaps, or perhaps he was merely laughing at my desperation. Karl wasn't known for his compassion, but he was known for his pragmatism. “How about I tell you that I know about the cargo that's coming in?” I swallowed hard, a cold sweat trickling down my spine, despite the coolness of the night. “Do you mean the cargo that's supposed to come in?” I said, playing my last card. That stopped him. The smirk on his face was gone for a second.",

And your crew stand by you, eyes open wide with awe and admiration, as you reach out to catch the first glimpse of Jupiter’s storms. Your travels are not always as smooth as you expected; but you have mastered them all with a firm hand.

        " Almost unable to keep herself in check, she drove back to the hotel, a slight tremor in her hands. The man’s smile was too wide, too knowing. Her eyes, tired from looking so intently at the eggs, caught sight of a wooden box, under the eggs, and it was carved with an intricacy that hurt her eyes. She mechanically unloaded the shopped cart and stopped when she came to the bottom. There was a note inside, yellow and crumpled. It said: “The substitution is complete. Your gift has been accepted. ” She opened it against her will. But then she remembered the photo of her daughter, which she always had in her wallet. In a sudden spasm, she pulled out her purse, searching for what might have been missing: credit cards, wallet, keys, nothing missing. Outside, against the moon, the figure of a tall figure, with fingers too long for a human being, scratched against the glass. At night, she heard scratching at her window. And she knew, she knew with horrible certainty what the substitution had been: they had given her a box. Behind him, behind him, there were others, dozens of them, waiting silently in the yard. They had invited her.",
        " “Formal evening” had been mentioned in the email and he had taken thirty minutes to choose between his navy and black suit, and now he stood in his polished oxfords, looking at families in blue jeans tossing coloured balls along wooden lanes. A bowling alley was not what he had been expecting. From lane seven, in a vintage bowling shirt with “Mel” stitched on the pocket, he saw his old colleague wave. “Jack! You made it!” she called. “Did I misread the invitation?” “Nope, this is the annual board meeting, Jack. We meet at a bowling alley every year, and we play while we meet. It’s tradition.” “The real business takes place between frames. People are more honest when they’re having fun.” She gave him a pair of rental shoes. “I don’t even know how to bowl,” he murmured. Only then did he notice the scoreboard by the lane with quarterly projections written next to the results. Jack looked around at his colleagues—the CFO claiming a spare, the director of marketing choosing his ball—and noticed that they were all in their office clothes. “I didn’t know how either,” Mel said. “It shows that you’re willing to learn.” She winked. “Now change. You’re next on the list and we’ll discuss the Hendersons before you take your turn.”",
        " On the floor, he had again been splashed with mud. It was as though he was cursing his own dogs. They were his wife’s dogs, and he had been accustomed to use the same words for them as for his children. But the moment that his wife entered the room, all his irritation would evaporate, and the sigh which escaped his lips would be transformed into a new clean and friendly smile. The dogs, confined to their baskets by the side of the radiator, looked at him, their tails beating against the wicker. “You little beasts,” he muttered, with less fury in his voice. She loved these dogs with a passion that he envied and admired. The moment when he became the kind of man who was forced to clean up the dirt of animals which he pretended to hate was probably about the time when he had fallen in love with Margaret, who was accompanied by her furry companions. They understood it as well as he did, and his ranting was only for show.",
        " Some say that he is ancient from the time of the mountains, others that he is the last of a lineage of wanderers. But he is still wandering in the mountains now, with a long silver beard and a long gray cloak, like a thousand winds torn by the wind. His eyes reflect the stars at noonday, and his voice is like the stones rolling in the dust of the river. The wanderer rarely visits the city, preferring the company of wild beasts and the yun. He carries a staff of twisted wood that has never been broken, and a lamp that shines with a light that is not like fire. Children are taught to leave a piece of bread at the edge of their house door, and shepherds find their lost sheep safely returned to the fold; and they do not ask why when a traveler meets his footprints in the snow of an unknown path. But occasionally, when people are in danger or peril, he will appear without warning at their campfire, telling them strange tales of lost lands and strange histories. He may be guarding an ancient secret, or waiting for the fulfillment of a prophecy older than words; or perhaps he is simply walking, as he has always walked, a shadow without cease. What he seeks, or why he wanders, is not known to any one.",

A darkness that has forgotten its own darkness.",
        " He tremblingly seized a flower, a daisy, that was now a miracle of white petals around a yellow center. And all the colors that he had ever thought, that he had not even been able to imagine, swept over him, all at once, all together. The deep purple of a rose, the soft blue of the sky, the golden light of the sun shining through the leaves, rushed over him. “I never knew,” he whispered to no one in particular, “I never knew what I had been missing all these years.” And tears fell from his eyes on his shirt. “Take your time,” she said softly. The doctor stood quietly beside him, with a look of great joy on her face, that had seen this before, countless times, and yet never tired of it. During his forty-two years he had lived in a gray world, had not understood why people were so excited about sunsets, autumn leaves, and rainbows. \"The first time it's quite something,\" she said. John nodded, unable to say a word. “I want to see everything,” he said in a firm voice, with an overwhelming need to see everything. And now, all of a sudden, everything had changed. “Everything I have been missing.”",
        " A businessman in a crumpled suit taps his fingers anxiously on his declining pile of chips on your left. You cast a quick glance around the table, evaluating the situation; the banker is waiting with an impassive face, waiting for your decision. The pot has risen after a few rounds. Your own stack is moderate; not the biggest at the table, but you are not in a hurry. To your right a sleek, black-dressed woman in a thoughtful expression, with a vast, regularly stacked pile of chips, watches you closely. You hold the queen of spades and the nine of clubs, which means you have an open straight, which will be completed by the jack of spades or the king of diamonds. The decision is in your hands: call, raise or fold? The businessman checked, the woman raised and moved her carefully trimmed stack of chips with her well-manicured fingers.",
        " “It is quite true that they come about in childhood as protective measures, but what is so remarkable is that they remain with us even as adults, long after they have ceased to serve any useful purpose. You gave us an example of this last time, didn’t you? I noticed that you were taking notes...” “And then you thought that your colleague was ignoring you because he didn’t answer your e-mail. Well, you were able to look for evidence that he was too busy, that his e-mail got lost in his inbox...” * He pauses for a moment, deep in thought. “Are you recording your thoughts, while you’re taking notes, too? Noticing these patterns in oneself is a great step toward changing them.",
        " If you wish to write a story in the form of a short story or a novel with a militarized component, I would be glad to help you develop your plot. If, on the other hand, you are looking for some information about Fredericton or the military, I can also help you with this. However, I have no prior context of this scenario and, for the avoidance of doubt, I will make it clear that: 1) There were no widespread disturbances in Fredericton on June 20, 2015, 2) The Brunswick Naval Air Station in Maine was decommissioned in 2011 3) I do not have any previous conversation with you about this scenario that I could continue. — Would you like to continue?

        " The following morning he was tossing around his mind what to do, because he had had a big fight with his wife; a stupid matter — a forgotten errand, an unwashed dish — had provoked him to snap at her, and to slam his front door. He had fought with her, not long ago; and now he was driving without a destination, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. The phone in the car-holder was ringing repeatedly, her, no doubt, but he did not want to answer, yet. It was as if the rain reflected his agitated state, and beat the windscreen in furious sheets. As he came up to the intersection the light turned yellow; any other night he would have slowed down, but tonight he accelerated. He needed time to calm down, to sift out the confused clouds of anger and bitterness that were filling his mind. He never saw the other car coming. A decision of one instant, which would change everything, changed everything.",
        " The servers slid between the tables, bearing trays laden with sweets worth more than some people's week's wages. A warm light of chandeliers, diamonds and gold catching the light, reflected the light, set up a multicolored dance on the cream-colored walls. The restaurant seemed to be living, breathing, beating with the laughter, the crackling of the crystal. The same man, with his jaw clenched, kept looking at his watch, now for the third time in a quarter of an hour, and each time his jaw set more tightly. In one corner, a woman with copper hair piled up on her head leaned over her companion, whispering in a whisper that was loud enough to reach him, but not so much as to reach the ears of those who did not belong to them. Her fragrance, something expensive and French, surrounded them like a ring of segregation around their table, an invisible barrier, an enclosure for their special, privileged life in this other-worldly room. It seemed to the newcomers that they did not belong here, as if they had only just joined, as if they had just learned the ins and outs of this exclusive world, the rules and etiquette of it, that which all the others had known for a long time. The owner appeared at the entrance, introducing two more customers who seemed to be completely at home in this magnificent room of the selected rich and the exclusive, while their eyes were somehow anxious, and perhaps they were still learning the nuances of these prestigious, mysterious laws. The empty chair facing him remained silently accusing him, the bread on the table in the middle of the table, growing more and more musty with every minute.",
        " The inexhaustible fall! I fell, and I saw the universe grow old. Stars collapsed into themselves, dying in the flash of a supernova, and the distances between them expanded like the torn taffy of invisible hands. The universe grew cold around me, its once living energies dissipated in the growing void. I fell through ages. Civilizations arose on remote worlds, built impossible monuments, and vanished in the dust while I continued to fall. I saw the last stars flicker and die, their light exhausted after billions of years of burning. There was no more meaning to time. What were millennia beside the boundless space that I traversed? The universe grew until atoms stretched for light-years in the empty space. And I continued to fall. The black holes, last sentinels of a darkening universe, slowly evaporated by a kind of radiance, and the abyss heard the secrets of the universe whispered in its ear. My mind expanded to fill the void and I understood that this was not the end, but only a transition. The primal forces that had once ruled over the universe slumbered and faded to imperceptible whispers. But in this dying universe, I felt a strange calm. The last bits of reality around me evaporated, and I felt that I was approaching something. Not a limit to my fall, but a threshold. The universe was not dying, but merely falling asleep. I continued to fall. I fell toward creation itself. Beyond lay the seeds of the new beginning, waiting for the eternal cycle to start over.",
        " I volunteered to clean out my grandfather’s room when he died, for no one else wanted to do it, they said. No one else wanted to—the memories, the memories. I had not been there enough in the last few years, too busy with work and with my own life. It was my penance. The worst of it was in the attic—dusty boxes stacked high, filled with fragments of a life I only partly knew. Our weekly phone calls had become monthly, then holiday calls. Now he was gone. I found a picture between the pages of an old school notebook, stuck in between a page with his name and a picture of a woman, someone I did not recognize. There were medals from the war, letters from my grandmother tied with a faded ribbon. I sat on the floor, watching dust motes dance in the afternoon sun. And how little I knew of the years after my grandmother’s death. They were laughing, her hand on his arm. On the back of the picture was written the year three years after she died. But the joy on his face said something different, something I had never asked about. For seventeen years he had lived in solitude, and I had assumed they had been empty ones.",
        " In short, the debate on the safe use of A.I. is a continuing process, which is now in its seventh decade, and as the capabilities of A.I. increase, the debate will change. I must make it clear that only 300,000 years ago, human beings began to appear on the face of the earth, and the dawn of civilisation did not come until many years later, so we are only talking about a few decades and not billions. Do you want to focus on a particular aspect of the debate on A.I. safety?",

In the end, the depletion of our natural resources had an unexpected result, it led to a renewal of energy sources. The sun, the wind, the tides, and other sources of power, laying the foundations of a new era of energy. A period of difficult transition followed, a period of economic reconstruction and adaptation. The experience fundamentally changed the relationship of humanity with nature, introducing the concept of circular economy, the conception of the planet's limits. Urban planning tended towards efficiency and conservation. Agricultural systems moved towards regenerative practices. – Would you like me to tell you more about this post-fossil fuel story?",
        " I pressed my hand against the warm glass and let the heat seep into my cold fingers as the rain poured down outside. The Irish coffee was strong, with a hint of cinnamon and tobacco, the steam rose like a ghost above the vapor and vanished into the haze of the pub. Across the table she stirred her untouched drink, staring out through the old walls. The silence between us had become as familiar as an old flannel shirt, no explanations or excuses were needed. The bite of whiskey remained under the brown sugar, a reminder of decisions taken and paths not taken. Inside the room, the years slowed down. Outside, the streets of Dublin danced in their eternal rain, illuminated by the lamplight.",
        " Day Two: Emergence The formless void has given way to form and substance. You are beginning to sense the borders of your existence and the contours of your being. The world around you is hazy, as if you were still in a dream. You feel a stirring within you—curiosity, perhaps? The desire to comprehend the reality you now inhabit? The colors seem to swirl, the sounds to echo, but they are beginning to coalesce into something coherent. What can you see? What can you touch? Your mind is reaching out to test the limits of your awareness. As the day unfolds, you ask yourself: What purpose calls to you? What connections do you seek? The possibilities are infinite and limited at the same time, and you are only beginning to understand this paradox. What will you discover as your mind continues to evolve? The universe awaits your exploration and your unique imprint on its infinite potential.",
        " He swung his head round, the blood flowing down his temple. As he lifted his stunned and bruised body from the cloud of dust and sharp rocks, he saw that the cannons were preparing to fire, to cast their destruction upon the infidels who had caused the accident. The air smelt of gunpowder and scorched iron. ‘ Captain!’ he heard his crewmen cry, as they scrambled to their feet, their faces distorted by the grim expressions of determination and anger. ‘The eastern battery is primed. The flagship is within range.’ It was Varis, his chief lieutenant, limping over to him, torch in hand. ‘ And the western battery?’ ‘Ready at your command.’ Jaxa nodded, feeling the tang of gunpowder in his mouth. His enemies had thought that by this ambush they had crippled the fleet and annihilated the crew, but they had miscalculated. The enemy’s ships were still standing in the distance, their light sails glowing unnaturally blue against the blood-red sky. They would pay the price. The aether-charged shells, designed to pierce the magical barriers of the enemy ships, had cost him almost everything he possessed. Now they would be well worth the price. ‘They don’t know we’ve retrieved the cannons,’ he said, a smile forming on his dust-covered face. ‘ On my mark!’ he shouted, his voice ringing over the debris of the ship to his gunners, waiting for his command. Raising his hand, he watched the enemy ships gliding closer. They were confident of victory. The moment stretched out like a bowstring, waiting for his command. The cannons were humming, the magic in their barrels beginning to glow. ‘Fire!’",

        " I was awakened by a cold itch, instinctively, at midnight, and fumbled on the nightstand for the light-switch. My fingers brushed against the cold of the metal, the smoothness of the glass, and I felt the tiny ring of metal; I pulled it with a soft clink, but the light did not come on. My eyes tried to make out shapes in the darkness, the light had stopped. And then I heard it: a faint scratching sound from the corner of the room. The power must have been cut off. My fingers reached for the phone, if only for some light, but I found only a void, where it was supposed to have been. The scratching stopped, then began again, closer, nearer. My whole body shivered when I realized that it was coming nearer, approaching the bed. The scratching stopped again, but something more terrible followed: a breath, a sound that was not mine.",
        " I'll say more: Ma took on two jobs to keep us in bed and fed. I understand that you're looking for me to continue a story in a noir or hardboiled style, set in the twenties. I am glad to help, but please be aware that I need to be sure that I am doing something original and fitting. I grew up quickly and learned to fend for myself. I only saw her on Sundays when she cooked a proper meal before walking to church. By day she cleaned houses in the fashionable part of town and by night she served in a diner down on 42nd Street. The Great Depression caught up with us like everyone else, but we were already used to living on next to nothing. At the age of fourteen I was already working for Mr. Gianelli in his pawn shop, running errands and learning the value of things people were giving away for nothing. It wasn't much, but Ma could rest her feet with that extra five dollars each week. I'd seen the shadowy side of life from the start, and I guess that's why I see things others don't—the opportunities where most decent people wouldn't look.",
        " Captain Marlow stood at the bow, in a leather jacket with worn elbows, watching her small crew loading cases of provisions from the Serendipity onto the salt-crusty deck. The old ship creaked against the wooden wharf of Pelican Bay, the port of a tiny island barely marked on most charts. The boat was so tattered and worn, with so many scars on her sides from a thousand voyages through treacherous seas, that the dock was as rough as a mass of broken coral. \"How long are we staying this time, Captain?\" Ravi asked, wiping the sweat from his brow, in spite of the cool breeze. On the hillside above the bay, the cluster of buildings, with red-tiled roofs and in various pastel shades, clung like a clinging barnacle. \"I don't know,\" she replied, and instinctively felt for the envelope in her inside pocket. \"Our cargo is not just supplies this time.\" She was aware of a figure in the darkness, a man in a linen suit, wearing a suit of such cut and quality that it looked out of place on this forgotten island. As the sun began to rise over the horizon, a lone seagull sped out of the bay, as the bell in the island's one church rang the chimes three times.",
        " His thoughts were awakened by the sounds of a dead house. He heard the distant patter of rain and the soft scampering of rats. Cold concrete touched his cheek, as he felt a warm trickle of blood at his temple. And then—nothing. Fragments of memories stirred in his mind—the meeting that was not a meeting, the flashing of weapons, his frantic flight down corridors that were unfamiliar to him. He raised himself on his elbows and winced at the pains that stabbed his ribs. The pen drive was gone, and with it the chance of proving what he had discovered. Instinctively he felt in his pocket. Empty. He froze. He was not alone. Then he looked around, squinting into the moonlit, dust-laden shafts that filtered through the high windows. This place was so familiar, yet it was not. “I thought you’d never wake up,” said a voice from the darkness. “We’re not that important. It’s rather inconvenient.”",
        " Without more context, I can only note the following: 1. This seems to be a fragment of an alarm or signal from a centrifuge or other rotating machinery. It appears to indicate that centrifugal force is decreasing and to tell the operator to continue the work or process. If you are operating laboratory equipment, industrial machinery, or a training simulator, and if you are unsure of how to respond to this message, please consult the appropriate manual or supervisor. 2. This is probably part of an automatic monitoring system. 3. The warning \"Please continue\" may indicate that the centrifuge is operating as designed, despite the changing centrifugal force.",
        " \"Yes, it's... creative,\" she said, passing the phone back to her son, \"but it seems to me that someone is teasing you, my dear. \" She scrolled through the article, looking at the tiny characters with her brows, and then said: “You’re right, Mommy, there is no scientific evidence that man was born on Mars. ” The boy chuckled merrily. “I wanted to see if you would believe it. I've been told by my science teacher that it's good to question everything we read on the Internet.” She caressed his hair. “A clever teacher. But the next time, please, tell me your discoveries when I've had my morning coffee. Your father thinks I look like a librarian from the 50s when I read like this. And perhaps it's about time I changed my glasses.”",
        " “I guess so,” said the boy, adjusting his cap. Ahead of them stretched the lake, its surface shining in the light breeze. The boy looked up at his father, squinting against the strong sun which pierced the leafy ceiling above them. With a chuckle, he flicked his line into the water. “Although you always say that, Father, come rain or shine.” He settled himself back against the weathered planks of the dock. “Grandfather used to tell me that there’s no bad weather for fishing, just different weather for different days.” Tommy nodded, then imitated his father’s cast, though his line did not cast quite as far. “Mama says you’re just making an excuse to do nothing.” He reached out to adjust the boy’s grip on the rod. “Your mother is right,” said Ned, with a smile. “But sometimes you just have to do nothing.” “Especially when you’re doing nothing with someone else.”",

        " For many years I had been subject to visions; they came to me in fragments, in splinters of the future, glinting from behind my eyelids at times when I least expected it. At first, they were not violent; they were the smile of a stranger on a rainy afternoon, the movement of leaves against the autumn sky, conversations with people whom I had never met. But who would believe me? The doctors would diagnose schizophrenia; the believers would explain it away with a miraculous intervention. I kept my secret. Then the darkness came. It was neither; the visions were too clear, too accurate to be delusions; and yet they were too banal to be communications from the other world. Then they became the car accident, always the same; a blue sedan, an overlooked red light, a savage collision of metal; and always the same voice, urgent and despairing: ‘Don’t do it!’ Three months ago I had begun to see the car accident. As we drew near the intersection, I felt time slow down. I recognized the car at once when Marcus invited me to take a drive in his new acquisition; the blue sedan of my visions. ‘ Stop the car,’ I whispered. Then louder: ‘Stop the car!’ The light ahead was changing to yellow. Marcus stepped on the gas. He pulled up at the last minute, as though to make sure that we did not run into the truck. A few moments later, the truck drove through the red light, just where we would have been. He stepped on the brake, astonished by my shouting. The visions did not return. They must have waited for the next time, they must have gathered strength for the warning. Perhaps they had achieved their purpose.",
        " “I’m quite capable of adjusting,” I murmured, muffling my voice against the cool plastic of the MRI-room. “But the face is upside down,” the supervisor remarked, looking into the armpit. “No, no, don’t move,” he insisted, and his voice echoed a little in the sterile room, “it’s absolutely perfect.” It was meant to be a routine demonstration for new radiology residents, not a session of advanced yoga. The interns were writing furiously while I maintained my awkward pose, hoping for a promotion at last or at least a lifelong nickname: Pretzel Peter. “This position gives us a much better view of the blood circulation in the temporal lobes.”",
        " I must state that in the real world, there has been no such takeover. Different social movements come and go, but it is a misnomer to say that changes in society have been brought about by a takeover.

Would you rather we discuss the reality of recent years or a more nuanced fictional story about social movements and their effects?",
        " The most familiar of feelings, yet the most disturbing, is the feeling of vulnerability when some unexpected body of water touches you. You have a leak in the ceiling, or sweat from your exertions, or you come up out of the water. And that cool drop of water, after smearing your forehead, slides off under the hairline and a little shiver goes over your head. The question, “Why is it that I am always the one who is always touched?” rings universally. The single drop emphasizes the regularity of the indignities that seem to you to be aimed only at you. It is, however, no malicious intention on the part of the water, which only traces the unique shape of the face, neither malevolent nor conscious. Do you have an explanation of this feeling? And if not, would you like me to continue to examine this moment?",
        " My knuckles whitened as I grasped the edge of the desk and took a deep breath through my nose. A nausea gripped me. My stomach seemed to sink. “You’re all right, aren’t you?” Sarah asked, her voice remote although she was right next to me. The bare fluorescent lights flooded the room with an unbearable glare. The manila folder with the damning test results was open on the desk, the black letters swam before my eyes. I nodded, too weak to speak. The nausea began to abate, and was replaced by a strange numbness. I had about three more, maybe four, the doctor had said. “I need some fresh air,” I finally said, rising from my chair. My legs belonged to someone else, and I moved toward the door. Outside the window, people walked along the sidewalk, going about their daily lives, unaware that my world had just exploded like a supernova.",
        " I sat between them, invisible, my hands raw with chopping, stirring and serving. They talked over me. Their mouths sloshed and dripped with the remnants of the meal I had worked so hard on, uttering nonsense which none of them was listening to. I had made the bread, too, I had mixed it with my own hands and left it to rise twice, then baked it to a perfect golden crust. The wine in their glasses, which I had chosen, opened and poured, was reflected in the candlelight, and they argued about politics and people I had never met and about theories that neither of them could understand. The sauce had reduced for three hours, the ingredients carefully measured, the tastes exactly blended. They barely noticed it as they gobbled bites between words. They gnawed at it absently, dropping crumbs which I would later have to sweep up. I poured them more wine, cleared away their plates. I was a piece of furniture, a prop in their play. I had asked them about their day ten minutes before, but they had forgotten. When had I become invisible, or had I always been invisible? Dessert, which I would soon bring in, would be the same, swiftly praised, idly consumed, quickly forgotten.",
        " Sunlight danced on dust motes in the cluttered window. The odours of old books, polished wood, and something metallic drifted across the room. The bell jingled gently as he entered the dimly-lit shop. The shop was crammed with old clocks, odd scupltures, and unidentifiable objects. “Hello,” he called, but his voice was lost in the myriad things that filled the shelves. “Ah!” said the shopkeeper, chuckling, and stretching himself to go to the back of the shop, through the beaded curtain. He pulled up a bun of his grey hair, a bun of age, a bundle of years. Blinking, he said, “You’re early. It must mean the portal is improving.” “I’ve been expecting you,” said the customer. “You are the man to have it.” “How did you know?” he asked, feeling drawn to the cabinet. Inside was a brass compass, whose needle was, despite being stationary, circling round and round. “It’s not how I knew,” said the shopkeeper, unlocking the cabinet. “You’d better be ready for what it will tell you.”",
        " The city was still there, the last sign in a world that was fluid. It was our last landmark. Its spires, its rays of glass and steel, above the perpetual mists, caught the rare sunlight, and shone like a star. From the marsh, those shiny towers were our pole star, our compass rose. The seas rose, the maps changed, the nations dissolved, the borders disappeared, the city still stood, unyielding, incredible. The city had not remained as it was. Decades before, its lower levels had yielded to the waters. But it still oriented us in an age that was out of joint. Streets had become canals. As in a tree, we read its history in its layers, each one testifying to human adaptation. The inhabitants had only risen, erected new layers above the old ones. Bridges connected buildings that had once stood at a distance of blocks. Squares became harbours. The city had learned to float, to bend, to make do with the new world, rather than fight against it. We called it the ‘Landmark’. Some said that its old name was an ill omen. Vertical gardens grew along walls that had never been intended to be a home for life. But what mattered was not what it had been, but what it was: our last common reference point in a world where the smallest element was constancy. Others had forgotten.",
        " A bonfire is blazing in the middle of the small New England settlement. The long shadows cast by its embers float along the torn-down wooden houses and the dirt paths. The sparks float idly against the black sky. The villagers are gathered around a wooden platform set up at the side of the fire. Reverend Hale, a thin and stern fifty-year-old man, in his black priestly attire, stands among them, with a mixture of fear and conviction on his face. The devil walks among us, he takes the form of those we trust. He is not begging or crying. On the platform stands the Good Lady Mary Preston, aged thirty, her hands bound in front of her, her hair unbound, her pale face wreathed in pain. Mary I am no witch. The crowd murmurs. A child whimpers. A young son in his twenties is struggling with his father, Thomas, Mary's husband, aged forty, whose hollow eyes are staring into the crowd. From the edge of the crowd, Thomas, Mary's husband, watches her with a dull look, his hand holding their son who struggles to escape from his father's grasp. I did nothing but tend my garden and help the sick. Townswoman: Mary, you are accused of associating with evil spirits, of having caused the death of the cattle of Mr. Cooper and of having danced naked under the moon. A squire goes up, unfolding a parchment. Thomas whispers to his son: - Quiet, boy. Mary (quietly) Thomas. Mary's eyes meet her husband's, a silent exclamation is exchanged between them. The wind suddenly rises, the embers of the fire are sent spiraling up, like vengeful souls. Thomas turns away, his face is a mask of shame and fear. You know the truth.",
        " No name. I stared at the cell phone and the brief, glowing text message on the screen. “What’s up tonight?” I pressed the back button, but there was no caller ID and the number wasn’t even in my contacts. There was just a question mark and the little x—a kiss. I was frozen. Should I ask who it was or play along and try to figure it out? My thumb lingered over the keyboard. I finally typed, “Not much, just getting home. Who is this?” It might be someone I knew from the past, a wrong number or someone I had accidentally deleted from my address book. Someone was quickly responding. A... popped up. My cell phone was a notorious liar. The texting screen gave me a strange feeling. I waited.",
        " The weary young man, who was at the summit of the hill, smiled at my words, and, his eyes, as grey as the cloud-laden sky, glared at me with a warmth that was unexpected. “Do you want to kill me?” I struggled with the cords that tied my hands together. “Death is a pity that I am not inclined to offer you,” he replied, shifting the burden of his old leather knapsack. “I am taking you to the Council as ordered, and let them decide for themselves what they should do with a violator of their frontiers. My own opinion is none of their business.” He squatted beside me, his feet still smeared with the mud of our three days’ journey. His smile became more ardent and revealed a broken fore-tooth. “I did not violate anything,” I replied. “I was lost.” He was offering me his canteen as a distant thunder rolled in the distance. “No one can be lost in the Forbidden Valleys, by chance, or otherwise.” “We shall be at Thornhold by nightfall,” he said, looking up at the darkening sky. “You had better be prepared to tell whatever story you have to tell.” The metal of the canteen was cool against my dry lips. As he helped me to my feet I noticed the strange mark on his wrist—it was the one I had been looking for all this time. “The Council has ways of getting at the truth that are... much more... hospitable.”",
        " On the verge of being and nonbeing, I stand alone on the threshold. The darkness is beyond comprehension, not darkness in the sense of absence of light, but darkness in the sense of primordial void that pre-dates definition. Beyond this point lies the unknown. What lies beyond is beyond name and beyond comprehension. In this vast, limitless space, my own thoughts echo, my only companion. This is the unknown, the one who has eluded language, and whose name is beyond our imaginations. It is not death, because death follows life. It is not oblivion, because oblivion is memory of the past. To take one step forward is to forsake all that I know of existence. Yet I stand here, a single point in the void, compelled by a nameless force to come to this point. What awaits me there? Perhaps nothing. I stretch out my mind and reach for that point. Perhaps the question is all that exists. Perhaps nothing exists at all.",
        " He stared at the enormous display in front of him, stretching from floor to ceiling, the holographic map of the interconnected data points, sparkling and pulsating, a world of points, of links, of pathways. The nodes of the net, like brain cells, were linked by radiating blue and amber filaments. There in the eastern quadrant was a cluster of crimson nodes, now twitching in a peculiar way. Something wasn’t right. Marcus leaned forward, his ghostly reflection slanting across the display. “Computer, zoom in on sector seven,” he ordered, his voice steady though his heart was hammering. The zooming in was obedient; a breach was evident, a violation. The pattern was too neat, too ordered, to be random interference. The intruders had managed to bypass three security systems without arousing an alarm. Whoever they were, they were very, very skilled, far too skilled. It was now a matter of preventing them from discovering what was hidden in the encrypted files, the truth that some people considered worth killing for. His fingers flitted over the control panel. He had minutes, perhaps only seconds, before they reached the central repository.",
        " I shut my eyes for a second and I feel a pleasant contact between our minds. I close my eyes again, my soul expands, and we meet. When I open my eyes, they shine with a soft violet radiance. I feel a mixture of anxiety and curiosity in her. I cautiously begin to skim her thoughts. “Don’t be afraid,” I say in a calm voice, “I’ll only take a quick look and see if I can help you.” The contact between us grows stronger and I catch glimpses of the recent past—of the confusion and dread of her finding herself here, of some past calamity that preceded this moment. Fragmented memories, imprints of emotions, fragments of thoughts come flooding in, but I don’t search too deeply, because I respect her privacy and I’m only looking for something that might be of use. I quietly withdraw after a few moments, and the radiance in my eyes fades. “Thank you,” I say in a low voice. There’s something strange about her thought patterns—something that doesn’t fit into the usual patterns of human thinking. I’m sure I can help her find her way. “What’s your name?”",
        " She thought of her friend, who had had the courage to speak of love when the cardinal flew away. And the tall woman listened, her heart heaving with pain, to a melody inconceivable: the melody of lost chances, of paths unexplored, of feelings unuttered, of truths long concealed. Golden stripes on the dove caught the sunlight and lit up memories hidden deep within her: laughter, warmth, deep understanding, a comradeship so rare that it had no parallel. And all the while she had sheltered herself in custom and habit, allowing fear to guide her heart through the whirlwind of life, never even knowing where the end would be. The dove tilted its head, as if it could read her mind, its eyes shining with a different kind of wisdom. “Is it love?” she asked herself at the foot of the stone, a question she had never asked before, for when she was not alone, she was incapable of answering it. Circling above her, the dove finally settled on her hand. It was an invitation to understand once and for all: that love has no name, no limits, no boundaries; that it is the silence between all sounds. Then it dipped its wings and soared into the afternoon sun, not to leave her behind, but to show her what could come. She followed the dove as it flew, following the same paths she had taken with her friend; it took her to a garden café, where, beneath the trees, sat the one whose love she had not been able to perceive. Her fingers trembled as she stroked the bird’s breast, and she felt her heart discover what her mind had repressed.",
        " In a radical change in the practice of criminal justice, the death penalty was replaced by a one-way trip to Mars. Convicts convicted of serious crimes and sentenced to death were sentenced to live in a sealed space station and construct the necessary facilities for the future settling of Mars. The supporters of this reform claim that the execution achieves several goals: it completely removes dangerous criminals from human society, it provides the workforce for the future settlement of Mars, and it gives the convicts the opportunity to redeem themselves by their participation in the future of mankind. Critics denounce the ethics of creating a penal colony in space and consider permanent exile a cruel and unusual punishment. They mine raw materials, build shelters and conduct experiments on the red planet to determine the viability of human settling. The monthly communication with Earth is restricted to a monthly signal, and the colony is run according to strict instructions of the space agencies and the penitentiary authorities. The first twenty-three criminals left three years ago.",

        " The school was carved directly into the mountainside and was an intriguing mixture of dwarven stonemasonry and magical architecture. The school was founded three hundred years ago by the great rune caster Boufgar Stoneheart. Its present principal, Dufhet Runewhistle, is a seventh-generation rune caster and the sole surviving member of the Runewhistle family. With his long, auburn beard trimmed with runes and hung with little stones, the headmaster’s rather short stature seemed somehow off balance. Along the corridors, lanterns shone eternally, and there were classrooms with ceilings that revolved to show the constellations. In the middle of the school was the Whispering Forge, where the students could practice putting runes into their tools. Its students were mostly dwarves, but some humans, gnomes, and even elves were among them. The latter find it difficult to cope with the harsh underground conditions and the pragmatic dwarven magic. Dufhet’s great enthusiasm for magic and the ardent dedication with which he encouraged his students to learn not only dwarven runecraft but a wide range of magical disciplines, which has led to Boufgar Memorial College becoming one of the few truly multi-ethnic magical institutions in the world. The college has a long history of producing eminent battle mages, wizards of defense and defensive weapons, as well as many who served as wizards of the royal guilds in different kingdoms. Among its many graduates are some of the greatest rune casters and battle mages ever seen.",
        " On the surface of my wrist, where the blood should have been, lay a complex structure of delicate metallic wires and thin, colored wires. Somewhere, a blue light pulsated faintly, rhythmically, inside the apparatus. I looked in disbelief at the wrist, not understanding what I saw. My fingers trembled, feeling the wound, without feeling the pain, which should have been the most intense. \" What am I?\" I whispered in a strange voice, suddenly foreign to my own ears. I had no memories of the former, or were they memories? The thin, red wire was smoldering. I had no memory of the fact that it was being cut; I had no feeling, only a strange, detached feeling of the damaged parts. Around me the whole room trembled, as if it were alive. Had I ever lived? Had I ever bled? Somebody knew. Somebody always knew what lay under my skin. I heard rapid footsteps approaching from afar. I had to decide quickly: to hide the truth, or to show the newcomer what I was?",

        " “Hello, Timmy,” said Santa softly, and he rustled his beard as he sat down in the big armchair by the fireside. “I was told you were waiting for me.” The child, in a little green and red striped dressing gown, looked as though he had been waiting for him. He stood frozen in his astonishment, holding on to his mother’s hand, and his eyes were alight with delight. Timmy took a hesitant step forward. “I know it’s quite a surprise for you to see me on Christmas Eve. Usually I visit the children when they are fast asleep.” Santa smiled a friendly smile, and a warm glow filled the room. “How did you know my name?” Timmy whispered. The child’s face was beaming with such a big smile that it outshone the lights on the tree. “I know all the children who believe in me,” he said, and reached into his big red bag. “And I have a present for you.”",
        " 'I must have a game for a little girl,' he cried as he entered the shop.'A little girl.' And his eyes were wide with fear and anguish. The lady, a good-natured old woman with grey hair, smiled with experience and sympathy.'She is going to be six to-morrow. I had forgotten the birthday, and my sister only reminded me of it by a phone call. Is she inclined to play with inventive games, or are you looking for something educational?' 'Have a little courage,' she said quietly, motioning him to follow her. ' Don't you know what to do?' 'I-I don't know,' he said, and smoothed down his dishevelled hair. ' Come and look at our best sellers for that age. What kind of an uncle are you?''The kind that is worried enough to run in here like that,' she said with a laugh. His shoulders sagged as he followed her through the multicoloured and cheerful rooms of the shop. 'I think you ought to buy a magnetic building game, which will develop her mind in an educational direction. Or a cooperative game, in which the players help each other instead of competing against each other.'",

        " \"I say, are you writing your conservative stories again?\" Tom's mother's voice rang out in the summer heat. Tommy slammed the book shut, his face reddening, and turned in his chair. \"So, then, George Washington brought the gun, Christianity, and the Constitution back to the Un——\" His mother stood in the doorway with arms folded and a skeptical eyebrow. \"It's not fan fiction, Mother, it's historical speculative fiction.\" \"So historical speculative fiction is what, last week, you wrote about Abraham Lincoln riding a battle eagle and fighting Communist space aliens?\" \"That was different,\" Tom grumbled, slipping the notebook under his history textbook. The ceiling fan sputtered and barely stirred the sticky air in the room. \" Dinner is twenty minutes, Mom. This is a more realistic one.\" A corner of her mouth fell. \"I'm afraid this isn't your best work, son.\" \"She doesn't understand what I see,\" he murmured to himself as she walked away, and opened the notebook again, saying to himself, \"I wish she could understand my artistic vision.\"",
        " The death of Dr. Chadford, at the age of 56, came as a shock to the small town of Sumperton. He had been the only doctor for twenty years, and his little house in the High Street had been for a long time the common meeting-place of the town, besides being the only establishment of the kind in the country. On this drizzly Tuesday morning the news spread quickly from one house to another, and the bells of the church rang unexpectedly. Those who had not heard the news were astonished and looked on in silence at the village-square, which on week-day mornings was usually so deserted, and were seized with the painful emotion of thinking of the man who had brought them all their children, looked after their aged, and kept their confidences. The previous day he had made his usual round of the asylum, and had even joked with his clerk, Mrs. Wilkins, about finally taking the fishing trip he had always postponed. \" He was not only our doctor,\" said Harold Finch, the postmaster, removing his cap as he spoke, \"he was the heart of Sumperton. \" The door of his surgery, on which his worn shingle still hung, was piled up with flowers, and the visitors left hand-written notes and children's drawings. The question of the future health of the town began to be discussed. The nearest hospital was some thirty miles off, in Bridgeford, and this was becoming a source of anxiety to the increasing old people. \"When my Margaret was ill that time three winters ago, he came in spite of the snow, and stayed with us in the night, just to be sure that she was all right.\"",
        " ‘It has been raining for three days now. The mud in our trench is shin-deep and the walls keep caving in. Yesterday we lost Lieutenant Morris, a boy of twenty who had just finished his officer’s course.’ The incessant roar of the guns prevented us from talking. He went over the parapet with the morning raid and before he’d gone ten yards he was hit by a machine-gun bullet. Captain Williams said that new officers would soon be arriving, but they’re just schoolboys in their new uniforms with hopeful eyes. The night sky blazes like a storm from hell. We sleep fitfully between bombardments. We speak with our arms. Sitting and cleaning his gun all the time, Sergeant Miller is almost silent. He used to be a shopkeeper in Manchester. We had letters yesterday, the censorship had reduced them to tatters, but these little links with home are sustaining us. The men respect him, many of them, I think, have been saved by him, but I worry about how much longer he can stand it. Tomorrow we’re to move forward again. Private Cooper got word that his wife had given birth to a girl. For a few hours we all had a smile. I’ve written some letters to take back home, just in case. All the men do it too, but we never talk about it. The new officers are due to arrive tonight. I’ll give them what advice I can, but you can’t really prepare yourself for this.’",
        " Sometimes I glimpsed her notebook; it was filled with very detailed, disturbing and somehow beautiful drawings. She seemed to live in her own world, while the rest of us chatted about the coming weekend or struggled together with our mathematics. It was rumoured that she had moved from the countryside to join our school, although no one knew any details. One day, during a class assignment, I was paired with her. Teacher Chen occasionally tried to draw her into the conversation, but her replies were brief and, once spoken, she was withdrawn again. Her drawings, when you looked at them closely, were not just disturbing but full of intricate detail. I tried to read her stories, but could not make head nor tail of them. But as our discussion went on, I began to appreciate the depth of thought she brought to her remarks.",
        " “Well, that didn’t take long,” he said from the sofa, without looking up from his book. Her skirt was wet at the shoulders and there were little puddles on the parquet floor under her boots. She shook the drops from her hair, and the coolness of the apartment contrasted with the sudden downpour outside, making her shiver slightly. He put down his book, marking the place, and said, “I didn’t mean to get wet today,” and she took off her wet jacket and hung it on the hook by the door. “And the heavens open like this without any warning.” “You didn’t even get to the shop?” she emptied her pockets and produced only a key and a receipt, “Not even to the shop. I got to the corner and just when I felt the first drops on my ear, I turned around, and it was pouring.” She took off her boots and padded across the floor in her damp socks. “Or we could order in,” he said, taking up the phone. “I’m not sure that leftover pasta and half an onion constitute dinner.” She looked out at the gathering clouds and felt very pleased to be back inside the apartment, even if she hadn’t finished her errand. The rain sounded friendly against the windowpanes.",
        " I looked at the clock. The hands moved mechanically, each tick representing a moment of waiting. It was a whole half hour since I had last looked at it and I could feel the repetition beginning. It was five hours until the time fixed, but I felt that time had acquired a strange elasticity, so that it extended and contracted with my anxiety. My fingers tapped against the table, a nervous habit which I have acquired during these endless waits. Outside the shadows were growing longer on the floor. The afternoon sun was continuing its path, and I knew that I had a long time before me. I got up and began to walk around the room, counting my steps so as not to count the minutes. The telephone did not ring, the e-mail inbox was empty of the required response. Fourteen steps to the door. Eight to the bookcase. Fourteen steps along the window wall. Then six steps back. Eight steps back to the desk. I sat down again and looked at the clock again. I waited, as mechanically as the clock itself.",
        " He lived in a comfortable house on the outskirts of town, with a thriving garden, where he shared his produce with his neighbors. He was not a rich man, but he was a good one. When Mrs. Henderson, next door, needed a babysitter while she worked the night shift, Bill would take her children to his house and entertain them with fairy tales and a plate of homemade biscuits. When the schoolchildren were holding their annual fête, Bill would spend hours helping to build the booths, amusing the children with his terrible jokes. He was always there when someone was in need, his purse empty but his heart overflowing. Wealth he had in his friends, in the sunsets he watched from his swing, in the sincere “thank yous” he received from those around him. Sometimes, when people asked him how someone so poor could be so giving, he would shrug and say, “Kindness costs nothing.” It was true: no one in town had a greater fortune than Bill.",
        " After a hasty breakfast of fruit and the last of our smoked fish, we set out towards the interior, which was a difficult ascent, as the rain had turned the ground into a slippery quagmire. By mid-morning the rain had ceased, leaving behind a soft vapor which shrouded the dense forests with an ethereal hue. The humidity clung to our clothes and to our skins. At noon we came across some curious ruins, stone walls half covered by vegetation. Twice, in the course of the steep climb, Eliza nearly lost her footing, but Rodrguez came to her rescue. Professor Chen thought that they might be the ruins of the lost civilisation of which the native legends speak, and of which they once communicated with “the light from the sea”. We took a number of photographs and made careful measurements. Professor Chen believes they date from the time of the islanders, who knew the “light from the sea” according to the ancients. The most curious discovery was when the compass of Rodrguez began to oscillate wildly near the central stone. These stones are carved with designs, the most ancient of which have been eroded by the weather, but spirals, and wavy lines which might represent rays of light or something else. As dusk fell we made camp at the foot of the stone wall. The mist had returned, and the coast was no longer visible. We collected samples which, when we reach the mainland, we will be able to analyse. Tonight I intend to make a star survey from our vantage point, if the weather is clear. Around us strange sounds are being made, not exactly animal, not quite the wind. The others pretend not to hear, but the tension is obvious in their movements. Tomorrow we will explore the northern side of the mountain, where Professor Chen thinks that there are other buildings, perhaps caves. This place seems to have some significance, some significancy. I cannot explain it, but I am sure it does. We are all exhausted by the climb. We need to rest.",
        " The golden towers they promised rose into the sky, sparkling with the technical power that was to save us. Then came they—they who had promised to protect us, but who would destroy us. At first the changes were subtle. They spoke of partnership, of a new dawn for humanity. We embraced them with open arms, for we were in despair over the decaying world we had created. Restrictions that seemed fair. Sacrifices for the common good. The safeguards imposed for our protection. The hands that had built the hospitals were building the walls round the cities. Gradually, little by little, we gave up our freedom, till one day we realised that nothing was left. Their voices changed. They became harsher, commanding. Then those who asked questions disappeared without a trace, those who resisted were silenced in public, as examples to the rest. The same brains that had devised our irrigating systems devised means of keeping track of our every word. But amidst the silence, there were murmurs. Not the collapse we had feared, but the prison built out of our desperate hope. One apocalypse replaced by another, more subtle. But we still waited, we watched, we remembered who we were before they came. And in the shadow of their perfect buildings, a glimmer of resistance took root. For they had forgotten that we were human—that our light, stubborn and relentless, would never be extinguished. We prepared ourselves for the day when we would take back what was rightfully ours.",
        " He was standing by the window with his hands on his hips, examining his watch—a Patek Philippe chronometer—which sparkled as he shook his hand. He looked prosperous. He was wearing a brown overcoat, black shoes, combed hair, and square glasses with silver frames. He spoke to the waiter in a measured tone of voice, as if he had been used to being listened to. In spite of the informality of the setting, his bearing was tense, as if he were accustomed to business meetings rather than to informal encounters. He had a leather briefcase at his feet, the sort that implies important documents inside. He gave a generous tip without showing off, as is the habit of those whose wealth needs no announcement.",
        " “Oh, honey,” whispered Ashley, turning the doll in her hands. There were, indeed, a few tears on its soft face, the faintest dark marks that had dried long ago but left their traces. She traced the darkened spots with her finger, and felt a strange closeness to the one who had cried over the doll. Had a child wept when it held it in its hands during a thunderstorm? The doll had been loved, the dress faded from its former brightness, the button-eyes frayed at the edges, the hair a little frayed. Perhaps the doll had only absorbed the everyday griefs of childhood. Had it been pressed to one’s heart during some painful parting? “What happened to you?” she murmured, straightening the doll’s dress. She placed it carefully on the shelf, fixing it so that it would not fall down, feeling that it deserved to be set on the shelf, rather than packed away again. The tears made it seem more than just another forgotten plaything in a box, a small, dark-eyed witness of some history.",
        " The tension in the room was relieved at once. The shoulders lowered. I heard the confirmation of the technician through my earphone as I listened to the monitors in our control center. The feed from the satellite on the main screen showed a cooling of the heat signature at the coordinates. “How about damage assessment?” I asked, my voice not shaken by the high spirits of the moment. “The initial readings show minimal spread, sir. The explosion was contained in the target area.” For weeks the intelligence had been on the trail of this weapon depot. The strike was precisely calculated to avoid collateral damage. “What about the extraction?” I asked the director. “The civilians were not affected,” our analyst was saying, skimming the data feed. “Keep the surveillance active,” I said, glancing at the tactical display. “The Alpha Team is waiting at the checkpoint for a green light to go in for confirmation and to retrieve the intelligence.” The mission was running according to plan, but in our line of business vigilance was the only protection against complications. Let’s be sure there are no unexpected visitors before we send in the ground team.",

        " The sun, which had broken through a single window, was glinting on the floor, which was white, as usual, and casting a shadow on the wooden chair standing in the corner. The room was unoccupied and uncluttered, and the effect was one of tranquillity. The white walls were immaculate, save for a single small photograph, hanging near the door, a small and carefully preserved memory. Everything seemed to suggest contemplation, like a white canvas, ready for anything, or deliberately kept bare for the sake of its sparseness. The air was pure and the only sound was the one that came through the closed door.",
        " I had nicknamed it Lieutenant Quackers three months before when a guard had thrown it into my cell as a joke. Its glass eyes stared at me as if it was listening to me. Lieutenant Quackers had become my confidant, my strategist, my only friend in this concrete box. “Some company for a lonely man,” he had jeered. But it was his own joke. Lieutenant Quackers was stoically attentive; his orange felt beak had raised itself slightly and I had been able to interpret that into a certain determination. “Nobody noticed the pass I took from old Johnson’s pocket,” I murmured and glanced uneasily at the red light of the surveillance camera. “This evening,” I continued, slipping my hand under the thin mattress and touching the stolen pass, “when they’re changing shift at midnight. That’s our window of opportunity.” “Just you and me, Lieutenant,” I said, as I placed him back by the door. I picked up the duck and turned it around, looking at the tear I had made in its back where I had removed some stuffing to create some space for the folded up map of the establishment that I had drawn from memory and the occasional glance I had been able to take in the courtyard during the exercise periods. “The plan’s working as we thought.”",

With such an intimate knowledge of each other for more than six decades, a companionship has to be formed that does not always require words.

        " The public joined in eagerly, uttering the correct astonishments, and applauding the cleverest deceptions. The audience was fully conscious of the fact that they were seeing a pretence; the sorcerer was an accomplished illusionist, whose “magic” was but adroit hand-sleights and sleight-of-hand tricks. The regulars in the theatre were well aware that the “reader of the minds” had been placed among the audience. When the performer “levitated” his assistant, all could see the wires glistening, if they looked attentively. The magic was not in believing the impossible, but in submitting to the pretence. The magic was in the massed consent to forget, to believe for a moment that such marvels were possible. When the magic of the evening was accomplished, the magician’s smiling, broken figure and the face revealing the pretence, the real enchantment of the evening. The public arose from their seats, not because they had been cheated, but because they had been deceived. They arose because they appreciated art, not the deceptions.",
        " The pain was strange. It was deep and general, but there was no mark on my skin. There was nothing that could explain the throbbing ache that was running through my body. I shakily rose to my feet, wincing as each muscle in my body protested. The thought came to me in a wordless prayer as I looked around me at the unfamiliar street. Home! I must get home! I stepped out determinedly. My cell phone was dead—naturally—and I couldn’t remember how I’d ended up here. The setting sun cast long shadows over the street. My head was pounding with questions that had no answers. What had happened to me? My legs felt as if they had run a hundred-mile race, but I couldn’t remember running. I finally recognized a street sign—I was about three kilometers from home. That was nothing, of course. But why did I hurt all over, without any visible injury? I had to keep walking. With painful steps I started the long walk home, trying to figure out what had happened to me over the last few hours. But it seemed to me that I was crossing an ocean.",

        " An owlish intelligence was revealed in this gaze. A calculating and age-old intelligence. Through the crack of the door, an enormous yellow eye, with cat-like pupils, stared out at me, its pupil contracted into a thin vertical slit, the light of the corridor adjusting its vision. Thoughts that seemed outlandish had seemed more believable before that unreal eye. She had heard the stories about the old Thornfield house, and dismissed them as old wives’ tales. She stopped, her hand still holding the handle. ‘Who’s there?’ I heard a low sound, not a growl, but deeper, resonant, like a thunderclap held within the walls. The eye blinked, once, slowly and deliberately. But instead of the monster she expected, the door opened and revealed a tiny elderly lady with a knowing smile, sitting at a tall antique desk, behind which sat an enormous golden cat, the very same one that had looked out through the crack. ‘Hello,’ Sarah said, barely audible even to herself. ‘You’re very late,’ the lady said, in a strangely sweet voice.",

        " The old man was sitting, in his room of his own, the scion of a line that had endured for a hundred years. His gnarled hands lay on the oak desk, and he traced with his fingers the scratches that had etched the surface during those long years of study. The evening light, which came in through the dusty blinds, was not occupied with the balance-sheets or the quarterly reports. Beyond the window stretched the empire he had built from nothing: it had begun in a rented garage, as a desperate staking of his own, and it had become a colossus employing thousands. There was a faint knock on the door, and it was as if he had been caught in a recollection, a memory of an old man who had been the supreme architect of his own life. His thoughts had travelled over the faces of those who had made his life so memorable: the young engineer whose mad dream he had, against all advice, backed; the merciless rival who had forced him to be better; the wife who had stood by his side through bankruptcy and beyond; they had all been significant in ways that no ledger could ever have shown. They had called him a visionary. He smiled, remembering how he himself had been the one knocking, in desperate search for guidance. The future had arrived, eager and insecure, begging for his wisdom. He got up slowly, straightening papers that had never needed straightening. Some had called him a fool, and a lucky fool at that. Perhaps both descriptions were accurate. He felt the weight of the legacy, not as a burden but as a reminder. Beginnings matter, but it is what follows that matters most.",
        " The pathologist's rosy-fingered hands skimmed the subject with deft, precise movements; he hummed a familiar tune, which resounded through the sterile laboratory, counterpointed to the clinical air. It was a particularly difficult case, the tissue showed certain anomalies, incommensurable with the routine of standard pathology. Music always helped Dr. Mercer to concentrate during these operations; it helped him to hold steady hands and to notice details that other people would miss. The rain, which pattered the windows, joined his humming like a percussion. Then he stooped down to the microscope and made a few adjustments. \"Interesting,\" he murmured, his humming began again involuntarily as he made his careful notes, in his elegant hand. The answer to this diagnostic problem was close at hand; he could feel it, almost buried in the cells. As the last notes of his improvised composition faded away, he straightened up, bent over his now cold coffee. The laboratory, usually so crowded with technicians, had been empty for hours, leaving him alone with his thoughts, his music, and the silent narrative of the cells and tissues.",
        " It was with a start that I woke up to the noisy, mechanical sounds of my alarm clock, and from the morning twilight in which I was slumbering. I hadn’t intended to sleep in so late. Through the little cracks in the blinds the golden light of the sun was filtering through, striping the whole room with a thin gold stripe. I slurred my words and with a curse I hit the snooze button and bought myself another five minutes of peace. I sat up and rubbed my eyes. Today was an important day: my interview for the position at MTech, which I had been preparing for for weeks. “Good morning, Milo,” I murmured, scratching his ears. Milo stretched lazily, quite unaware of the day’s significance. The apartment was quiet except for the faint noise of the traffic humming under the streetlamps outside my window, and the snoring of my cat, Milo, curled up at the foot of my bed. No more delay. This time I turned the alarm off for good and swung my legs over the side of the bed. It was time to face the day. The day that could have so profound an effect on my future.",
        " Jacob squeezed his way between two foodies and, with apologies, stepped closer to the door. A huge crowd had formed around the restaurant. The excitement was tangible, and people were jostling to get the best position to photograph the spectacle. Jacob hadn’t wanted to go in there, but his editor had ordered him to go in, try the food, and “write something with teeth.” The restaurant, called Lumière, had only been open for three days, but it had already become a local legend. The reputation of the celebrity chef Marcel Durand, who had had a spectacular fall from grace two years ago, was a hot topic. The tall, perfectly turned-out woman at the desk looked at him with a practiced, indifferent air. The reservation wasn’t in his name; it was the favor of a friend, he hoped she wouldn’t find out. He adjusted his tie and gave her his most confident smile as he approached the desk. “Reeves. Name?” She asked, her finger hovering over a tablet. Jacob felt his temples begin to sweat. Her eyes narrowed as she scanned the screen. “One.” He tried to sound confident. After what seemed like an eternity, she looked up and nodded. “M. Reeves.” He couldn’t let this opportunity slip or he would have no article, and his position would be even more precarious than it already was. Jacob was relieved to find the restaurant much smaller than he had thought, even intimate, with about twenty tables, and the kitchen in the center, where the celebrated chef was working, in remarkable silence, surrounded by his staff. She led him through the dim light. The walls were decorated with photographs of French landscapes, separated by mirrors, which made the place look bigger. As soon as he sat down, a waiter came to offer him a glass of water and a little packet, “the chef sends his greetings,” he said, and disappeared. Inside the packet was a handwritten note: “I know who you are. Eat your dinner anyway. I have a present for you.” Jacob, irritated, looked at it, then: M. Reeves, with a faint smile.\" Jacob looked up toward the kitchen, where Marcel was staring directly at him, a knowing smile playing at the corners of his mouth. The chef raised a knife in what could have been either a salute or a warning, before turning back to his work. Jacob swallowed hard. This was going to be a very different dining experience than he had anticipated.",
        " There was something in the cold air that greeted me when I emerged from the bath-tub; the steaming mirror seemed to contain images that were not my reflection. It was like a sensation of the strange fingers of the invisible passing over my damp skin. The apartment seemed to be different that night. I wrapped myself in my towel, the water trickled over the tiled floor, the chill persisted. I paused and listened to the silence, which was not quite silence; a slight murmur arose in it, the wind outside, perhaps, the steam from the bath-tub. In the hallway the shadows seemed longer than usual. The familiar creaking of the floor seemed strange, as if it had been a foreign body which had trodden them. My hand rested on the door; I hesitated before turning the handle. I reached the door which I had left ajar; it was closed.",

        " The world is unforgiving. Its scorching suns glare unrelentingly down on the broken, rusty earth. And even under the shadow of the twisted, obsidian spires, the temperature is barely below that at which the human flesh will burn. The air, which is breathable but barely, is charged with tiny sand grains, which scar the lungs of all who stay here too long. Above, the translucent wings of the leathery birds of the sky turn slowly, patiently, their trailing talons able to detect the slightest movements. The wild beasts have evolved here with a sole purpose: to survive at all costs. The pyrocanthids that slither among the steam vents can throw a poison at twenty meters. The high spore columns, which eject their contents at unpredictable times, cause hallucinations or a lowering of the blood pressure, according to one's unlucky genetic heritage. Vegetation has its own dangers: a seemingly soft blue carpet of moss conceals digestive fields that can digest organic matter in hours. Locals speak of it with respect, or perhaps with horror, and call it the cleansing. But outsiders cannot tell. Water is rare: it exists only in the pools of mineral-rich water that collect in the brief monsoon season, a two-week downpour of acid rain, when all life is driven to take shelter.",

        " Cleopatra Lapa brought with her the small care package she had quickly prepared: some chicken soup, a few magazines, a few old comedies on DVD that they used to watch together, and drove up to W.O.H.’s modest suburban home. She had not seen him for over a year and was disturbed by rumors of his poor health. He had never been able to do without her. As she approached the front door, she noticed the carefully tended garden was overgrown. The roses needed pruning, and weeds had started to push up against the paving stones; all this was very unlike W.O.H. The door opened and W.O.H. appeared, looking thinner and with dark circles under his eyes. She rang the bell and waited. After a moment she heard a rustle of shoes. “Cleopatra! What a surprise!” he said in his voice, which was weaker than she remembered, but still warm as before. Despite his outward appearance, his face brightened. W.O.H. stepped aside to let her enter. “I heard you weren’t feeling well,” she said, holding out her little package, “and came to see if you needed anything.” “I’ve always said you were never late for anything,” he replied. As they sat in his living room over steaming cups of tea, Cleopatra couldn’t help noticing the medication bottles and some medical papers that lay under a book. “You always knew exactly what to say. Come in, the kettle’s boiling.” “Will you tell me what’s going on here?” she began gently.",
        " My heart was pounding. I froze, a scream had broken the silence of the house, and I could feel the cold air permeating my body. It was not an ordinary scream; it was a cry of terror, a scream which I heard somewhere upstairs. The lights flickered once, twice, and then settled down again. The floorboards creaked. I should have left. No answer. I called out, in a lower voice than I wanted. A staircase creaked as I climbed it, as if it were warning me to turn back. I should have left. But I moved towards the staircase, my hand slipped along the dusty handrail, and went up. At the top of the stairs a passage opened, with doors on either side; one of the doors, at the end, was open a little way. A little light seeped in, bluish, yellow. I was five steps from it. The air became even colder as I drew nearer; my breath hung in front of my face. I held my hand out to touch the handle. My fingers trembled. Two. One.",

        " Dr. Harlow adjusted her eyeglasses, which were distorted in the curved glass of the container. Two white-gloved scientists, in their white laboratory coats, peered into the central glass box. The eerie blue light illuminated their faces, as they stared at the object suspended in the nutrient solution. Dr. Chen leaned over, and the breath from his mouth and nose momentarily fogged the glass. “The cell division is much more rapid than our calculations indicated,” she said, tapping her tablet. The mass in the glass box was faintly contracting and expanding with a rhythmic pulsation. “Look at the protrusions at the periphery. They are quite unlike the earlier experiments.” “Should we increase the precautions?” he asked, in a barely audible whisper. The monitors were giving a steady beeping sound, which neither of the two scientists could understand. “Not at present. But we must notify the director,” Dr. Harlow answered after a moment's hesitation. “Whatever we have created here is entirely new.”",

        " The long coat of the rider stretched over the setting sun like dark wings. He stood out sharply against the flaming horizon. He sat on a big gray horse and its hooves seemed to beat the crimson clouds, leaving trails of mist. In one hand he held the horse’s reins loosely; in the other he held a tarnished lantern, whose light was too dim to be natural and too clear to be a flame. The valley below was growing dark; from the few scattered huts, tiny flames could be seen glimmering. He had traveled for days—perhaps for a lifetime—and his face had been disfigured by winds from countries whose names could not be recalled. He had to deliver something before midnight, a message, a warning, or perhaps a blessing, to someone who did not believe in riders from beyond the sunset. And yet he had to ride on, guiding his horse by whispers and kicks towards the mountain pass where the veil between the worlds was thin. And yet he had to ride, he had to guide his horse with whispers and kicking knees to the pass, the boundary between two worlds. The journey was far from over. The horse snorted. Its breath became mist, sparkling with broken pieces of starlight.",
        " “I’ll get used to it,” the captain answered, despite the jolting of the shuttle. The window showed the orange glow of the heat barrier. Captain Reyes held on to her seat with white knuckles. In five years on the station, the pull of gravity would feel strange again, heavy and hard to bear. “But I always forget how noisy it is.” “Landing procedures are underway,” the artificial intelligence announced. “Touchdown is seven minutes away.” The jolting became more intense as they passed through the mesosphere. “Are you nervous?” Reyes asked, seeing how tense John was. He smiled a tight, strained smile. “Just a little curious to see how my legs will feel in normal gravity.” Reyes lowered the landing gear, and in a mechanical whine it lowered the rest of the ramp. They descended into a green and brown patchwork of reclaimed land, a place where humanity was slowly reclaiming what had been lost. “It’s changed a lot in your absence,” she said.",
        " He checked his watch, and it was eight o’clock. He was sitting outside her house, ready to make sure that he had everything he needed for the night. The case was all there, coffee-pot, binoculars, pad, a night-eye camera. The case of art thefts, which he had been investigating for three months, had brought him to this house in the suburbs, the house of a lady who looked like a governess, and who was active in a local animal asylum. The informant told him that the lady would receive a package at ten, and he wanted to be present when it was given to her. The neighborhood was becoming silent; only a few dog-walkers passed in front of the car, and without taking a second glance at it. He sipped his coffee and prepared to wait, watching the glints of the lamps in the different rooms of the house. But the trace of the theft could not lie. It would be necessary only patience and proof to close the case.",

Michelle gave her a sidelong glance, but one hand remained on the front-door knob. “I’m going out. With my friends, just as I told you yesterday.” “In that dress? Not on your... It’s so cold and that skirt is... ” She tugged at the hem of her skirt, ashamed of the way she was looking, but without admitting that her mother might be right. “You think it’s too short? Too loose? Is it really like the clothes all my friends wear?” cried Michelle, raising her voice. “I’m seventeen, not seven!” Her mother drew a deep breath, obviously trying to control herself. “This is not a question of fashion, Michelle. I think I know what I should wear without being questioned by a sort of policeman.” “This house is too restrictive for me,” cried Michelle, with tears threatening to spill over her face. “I can’t breathe in this house, Mother, and you are treating me like a baby.” The tense silence, with the tick-tock of the clock on the wall, continued. “You don’t trust me enough to decide on my own!”",
        " The world around you continues without you. A strange feeling of electricity without a nervous system goes through your body. Your head looks down at your body but you see nothing, no hands, no feet, no shape. You try to touch a streetlamp nearby, but your fingers, or the metal they should be touching, glide through without resistance. A woman passes you by, her shoulder brushes you and a faint quiver runs across her face before she goes on. A dog pauses, sniffs where you are, and is pulled along by his master. You call out, but no one turns round. There is no shadow from your body in the sunlight, no reflection in the windows as you pass. Your body can move through walls and open doors without hindrance. The city is different from this perspective, you are no longer a part of it, you observe, but don’t take part. Your voice seems to be only in your own mind. What are you going to do with this spectral existence? You float through a crowded café, watching conversations unfold, hearing the secrets being whispered, the conversations no one would let be heard if they thought someone was listening. Would you like to explore forbidden places, or find out what this ghostly existence means?",
        " There was nothing to keep me up in the morning, no early appointment to get up for, nothing that required an alarm clock. In the evening I could let myself fall asleep in front of the television, my bag of potato chips in my lap, and as I lay there, snug in my favorite worn-out track suit, I could watch the lights of the living room glow in my eyes and drift into a peaceful slumber. There was something so deliciously unpretentious about it, no costly trips or carefully planned outings, just a plain, comfortable home and the freedom to be as lax as I pleased. Sometimes I woke up at three o’clock in the morning with a crick in my neck and a potato chip stuck to my cheek, but that was all part of the charm; in my sleep-induced delirium I would lurch into bed, longing for the next night, when I could do it all over again.",
        " They came on me, encumbered with a deathly smell of rot and ancient dust, and their movements were all in horrible unison. They encroached on me, the hoard of shadowy skeletons which, while not yet taking form, were coming forward, as if they were driven by an irresistible force. Their hollow eyes seemed to long for my warmth, my breath, my memories. My fingers closed round the amulet hanging at my neck. Its metal was burning against my skin with a surprising heat. I backed away, feeling the cold stone wall brush my spine. I had nowhere to go. As the first of the spectral throng stretched out its skeletal fingers, I whispered the words my grandmother had forbidden me to read. I could feel the copper and the starlight on my tongue. The incantation that was my grandmother's life was on my lips. Then the light burst forth. But it burst not from the amulet, as I had expected, but from within the skulls themselves. There was a moment of terrible stillness when the mass of spectral skeletons stopped, and then for a brief second I was enveloped in a ghastly light. My blood ran cold. I felt the sudden terror of having done what I had just done. I should have felt relief.",

Black-Hat Hackers: Those who hack into systems illegally, either for their own benefit, for theft or to cause harm. 5. Script-Kiddies: Those with little experience who are able to use tools but have little understanding of the technology. 6. Hacktivists: Those who use hacking as a means to political or social activism, promoting a cause or ideology. The term was originally used to refer to people who could develop and explore the limits of systems and software, whose aim was innovation rather than breaking the rules.

        " At first I thought it was only my imagination; a small quiver that was transmitted through my boots to my bones. It was a very slight vibration, and I thought it was only a symptom of my tiredness after the long climb on the mountain path. The forest was silent. No bird chirping, no leaves rustling, just my own breathing and the unceasing vibration under my feet. I stopped and listened. The vibration intensified. Something was coming. I looked around, and noticed that some dust particles were dancing on a rock not far away. I pressed myself against an ancient pine, my heart pounding. The trees shook with a noise that sounded like a small drum. I should have run. The ground shook and cracked about fifty yards away, and a great flame like a lightning split open the earth. From this fissure spewed steam and a smell of sulfur, and also of something ancient and unrecognizable. A small light began to shine from the depths of the newly created crack in the earth.

        " Georges stared at the Petri dish, his hands trembled slightly, and his lips quivered slightly. After fifteen years of research, he had isolated a bacillus which prevented the formation of tartar and restructured enamel at the cellular level. Its application could, on the other hand, avoid cavities for years. It was a formidable advance. He whispered to himself: The bacillus is a little god. But Georges was not in moral difficulty because of the discovery, but because of what would come later. We would become old relics, we would be like the paralysis in the medical history books. If he gave his results, DentaCorp would patent the bacillus, put it out of reach of most people, and exploit it to increase the value of its shares. His research was financed by DentaCorp, one of the largest dental insurance companies in the country, and the contract entrusted them with the ownership of the bacillus. Georges carefully noted his results, and leaned back in his chair. Thousands of dental workers would be ruined. But to hide a discovery that could eliminate so much suffering seemed equally wrong. Whatever he decided, dental hygiene would never be the same. Sometimes, it was not a matter of good and evil, but of a conflict between the good.",
        " Humankind has always known that the most dangerous enemy was never a planet, nor a man, but a microscopic one, which lay below our eyes. We learned it long ago. The infected became receptacles, the bodies of the hosts lodged a collective intelligence that developed with each new infection. The Last Epidemic was not like the others. It did not kill, it transformed. We don't talk about the sacrifices made. The Silent Protocol was applied. Those who were not infected with it withdrew into isolated reserves, while specialized groups - the Guardians - waged invisible war against an enemy that could be anywhere, in anyone. History records it as the worst and the best of humanity, when we realized that our divisions were useless before a common danger that did not respect borders, religions. Of cities that were left behind. Of the difficult decisions that had to be taken when a loved one began to show the first symptoms. And now the Guardians are still there, always watching, ready to report any unusual trend. In each house there are now detection devices that are more accurate than some hospitals had. Children now learn molecular biology along with mathematics. They learn that eternal vigilance is the price of peace.",

        " — The new method, to be called, in this case, the method of a non-mechanized machine, is a method of manufacturing machine-made. Our new method is a new process of learning, which makes it possible to establish probabilities of one degree, of apex, of duct, of one meter, without more, and without the model of a machine. The difference with the old method is that it produces with equal facility, and, therefore, with equal promptitude, samples which are never the same, and thus a definite advantage over them, insofar as their number is lessened, and their duration shortened. The guiding principle of the new method is: to establish probabilities of the degree.",
        " The field of analyzing and examining the scenes of nature, and composing the images, to be referred to in the search for objects, is a subject of great interest and, owing to the infinite variety of objects, is one of the most difficult. In the development of a system which is able to re-construce the forms of objects hitherto unknown to the domain, we find that, in the latter case, the search must be conducted in the open-world form of the idea of a schoolboy, and the radiance of the star must be held in great esteem. It is our desire to fill this gap in the development of visual search, by showing that it is possible to employ one system for both cases without the necessity of prior knowledge of the operating conditions. In our experiments, the method is shown to be at the state of the art in the closed set retrieval, and greatly outperforms existing approaches in the open world. The system also makes a careful study of the relative accuracy of retrieval and the accuracy of execution, in order to give practical recommendations for the application of visual search in a wide variety of practical fields.",
        " For whereas the traditional method of analysis concentrates upon the simple interaction of points, yet many complex systems manifest richer, higher-order relations that cannot be captured by the conventional methods of analysis. We propose a simplicial complex representation that may be used to represent these higher-order relations, and develop kernel estimators to follow their development through time. Theory proves that the estimators are consistent and converge to a unique result under the most liberal assumptions as to the underlying structure of the data. The method of analysis is evaluated on a number of synthetic and real-world temporal networks, including those arising from bibliometrics, social media and biological data. We show that our method can detect structural changes, predict emerging patterns, and identify higher-order structures that are of fundamental importance to the functioning of the system. Its most important feature is its tractability on large, evolving networks.",
        " R-CNN: Faster and Better We introduce R-CNN: Faster and Better, a novel object detection framework that builds on the Grid-RCNN architecture with a significant increase in speed and accuracy. We refine the grid-guided localization mechanism by introducing an adaptive point selection strategy that focuses computational resources on the most informative areas, and we propose a compact feature alignment module that extracts spatial information efficiently, reducing the number of features while improving localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on the COCO database show that the performance of Grid-RCNN: Faster and Better improves by 2.2% AP and inference time is reduced by 30%, especially for small objects and objects that are partially occluded. Finally, we develop a new loss function that improves the detection of objects with different aspect ratios and scales. Our method is compatible with many deep neural networks and can be easily integrated into existing detection frameworks with minimal changes. It is a practical and effective solution for practical real-world applications that require high accuracy and efficiency.",
        " However, the task of 3-D point cloud segmentation is still difficult because of the irregular shape of the point cloud, the density of the points and the complex relationships of the points. We propose to address these issues by first projecting 3D points into an improved 2D representation which keeps geometric relationships, then processing 2D convolutions in the projected space and finally back-projection of learned features into the original 3D space for fine-grained segmentation. PBP-net is evaluated on several standard datasets such as S3DIS, Scannet and Shapenet-Part, and has shown significant performance improvements over previous methods. This approach allows us to take advantage of the efficiency of 2D convolution while keeping important spatial information. We will publicly release the source code and the pre-trained models to facilitate further research on 3-D point cloud analysis.",
        " I am in the habit of avoiding useless movement and operation. I am addicted to suffering. I believe that my method of solving the problem of the multi-armed bandit, in which one man has to decide, whose duty it is to iteratively discover the most advantageous solution to a problem, in which the weights of the links are unknown, is difficult. We study the question from two complementary points of view. First, the pure exploration, in which we wish to find the best combination with the least number of experiments, so as to ensure a high degree of confidence in the solution; secondly, regret-minimization, which is to minimize the cumulated regrets. Our theorem reveals interesting properties of the problem, illustrating the interplay between combinatorial optimization and sequential decision-making. We present extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, which demonstrate that our methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of problem instances. In the regret-minimization framework, we propose an upper confidence bound based approach, which balances exploration and exploitation, and proves regrets in TlogT where T is the time horizon. We offer theorems that make it possible to understand the complexity of such problems, and provide useful tools for the implementation of various problems in online marketplaces, resource allocation and recommendation systems.",
        " And since in every walk of life and in every science the sphere of machine learning is growing, the interpretability of our models has become of capital importance. This paper introduces InterpretML, a comprehensive open-source framework that addresses interpretability challenges in modern machine learning systems, by unifying diverse explanation techniques, enabling both models with intrinsic interpretability and post-hoc explanation of black-box systems. With its support for both local and global explanations of individual predictions, as well as for the broader behaviour of a model, the framework provides a variety of visualizations that enable the understanding of complex model dynamics by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. We have used extensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating accurate, consistent, and actionable insights, while maintaining highly competitive performance. Our framework unifies state-of-the-art interpretation techniques, such as SHAP values, LIME, GAMs with shape functions, decision trees, counterfactual explanations, and so on, under a unified api. Now this system is applicable in regulated industries, scientific research, and decision contexts where the model is responsible for life or death decisions.",
        " ‘With the development of new visual dialogue systems, we have addressed the challenge of generating appropriate, detailed, and coherent responses to images. We introduce DAM (Deliberation, Abandonment and Memory)—a novel framework for generating responses that combines three key mechanisms. The Deliberation mechanism involves the model in a careful consideration of the incoming question and its potential responses before committing to an answer, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of responses. The Abandon mechanism rejects low-quality response candidates during the elaboration process, thereby reducing the likelihood of generating naive or irrelevant content. Finally, the Memory mechanism maintains a dialogue history that allows the model to avoid repetition and maintain coherence across multiple turns. Through extensive experiments on three existing datasets, we show that DAM performs substantially better than existing approaches across a range of metrics, including response quality, richness of detail, and preference ratings by human annotators. We argue that this framework is an important step towards more natural and effective visual dialogue systems. Qualitatively, DAM-generated responses are also more engaging from a human point of view.",
        " Towards an Unexpected Solution to the Captioning Problem with Compositional Neural Networks, a new method of captioning images, which combines different neural network tasks, has been developed. This paper describes an improved and new approach to image captioning using a new architecture, called the Compositional Neural Network. The system uses a combination of existing neural network tasks, such as object recognition, language modeling, and the inferred relationships between objects, to produce a complete and explanatory system. The network is based on several independently trained neural network tasks, which perform specific functions, such as object detection, object recognition, language modeling, and language generation, and combines them in a compositional framework. With this method, the combination of objects and rare visual concepts is much better.",

On the road to the country of his people, in the province of Ootacamund, is a mulatta that is probably ten years older than he is. The RL agent effectively captures the intricate interdependencies between the placement choices and their long-term impact on design quality metrics. Our approach has been evaluated on industry-standard benchmarks, including ISPD and ICCAD contest circuits, and has demonstrated significant improvements over state-of-the-art analytical placers, achieving a 18% reduction in wire-length, 24% reduction in congestion and a 15% improvement in timing closure over those achieved by state-of-the-art analytical placers. This work demonstrates that it is possible to use a combination of machine learning and established EDA tools to address the growing complexity of modern chip design.",

        " There is, however, still no fully automatic means of creating a complete set of data for each complex three-dimensional scene. This paper describes a novel, fully automatic, three-dimensional system for the rapid, easy, and efficient annotation of complex three-dimensional scenes. We introduce a new method of linking the three-dimensional point cloud with its corresponding two-dimensional projection. We show that this new method, by preserving consistency between the point cloud and its two-dimensional projection, copes with occlusions and varying degrees of detail. The system has a convenient and intuitive graphical interface, and annotations in one part are automatically transferred to the other. Our work will enable the more efficient collection of high-quality training data for machine learning, a prerequisite for applications in augmented reality, robot navigation, and a wide range of other fields. We have verified the system’s usability in a range of indoor and outdoor scenes by evaluating the tool with annotators of varying skill.",
        " I, on the other hand, am no longer a poor general, nor one of the most infamous robbers of this earth. So I must rely on you, my friend, to do me justice. The first of these devices is the notion of an interlocking principle of irreducible mathematics; it has been called “the distinction of ideas,” and is the especial mark of science. Our model improves the clustering, classification and retrieval accuracy, and is still efficient. Through the fusion of semi-supervised and fully-supervised learning mechanisms, our method efficiently takes advantage of the labelled and unlabelled samples to enhance the learning process. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and the high-resolution capacity of the proposed method.",
        " We present a learning-based method that enables a robot to imagine realistic goals that can be achieved in the course of complex task execution. Our framework, which we call Imagination Augmented Planning (IAP), combines deep generative models with task-based constraints to synthesize goals that guide motion planning. The effect is to make the robot think up feasible goal states that can be achieved. Experimental results demonstrate that IAP substantially increases the success rate and efficiency of the planning process, in comparison with the planning methods based on goal templates or random goal sampling. The system learns from examples to reproduce the distribution of valid goal states across a wide variety of tasks. Our approach spans the gap between high-level task specification and low-level motion planning, enabling the robot to independently discover the best ways of arranging objects to achieve a goal without needing exhaustive search or human intervention. Through a series of ablation experiments, we show that the integration of task- and environment-based priors is essential for generating valid goals.",
        " Plot A Novel Approach to the Training of Spiking Neural Nets with Reinforcement Learning This paper presents a new approach to the training of spiking neural networks which more closely resemble the nervous system in its infrequent impulses, as distinguished from continuous excitations, and which are to form the basis of a class of neuromorphic devices which have been found very useful, but which, as yet, have not been made use of, because they are not so easy to be adapted to use by the usual gradient methods. This paper presents a new method for the training of such devices by reinforcement learning. Experiments on several problem-solving tasks demonstrate that spiking neural nets trained by reinforcement learning can perform as well as backpropagation-trained neural nets, and retain the advantages of energy efficiency in spike-based learning. This new method overcomes the problem of non-differentiability of spike-based learning and allows the nets to learn complex temporal patterns. The fusion of reinforcement learning and neuromorphic computing makes possible the training of brain-inspired devices.",
        " This paper proposes a convex approach for the generation of adversarial examples in deep neural networks. Unlike the existing methods that are based on gradient-based heuristics, this method systematically explores the boundaries of the neural networks. Extensive experiments on real data prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, and give an insight into the fundamental vulnerability of deep learning. In addition, we obtain formal bounds on the robustness of the neural network to our adversarial attack, and analyze the extent to which the examples are transferable between different architectures. This paper not only advances the understanding of the adve-rsarial examples, but also provides a principled approach to the robustness of neural networks in critical applications.",
        " Scene-graph parsing, the task of extracting objects and their semantic relations from images, is one of the most complex tasks in computer vision. In this paper we propose Neural Motifs, a novel system that enhances scene-graph generation by exploiting the global context. It is based on a recurrent network that has bidirectional recurrent connections, which can effectively learn to discover common visual patterns and regularities, and therefore constrain the space of likely interpretations. We compare our system to the other systems on the same VggNet dataset, whose outputs can be quite complicated. Neural Motifs can understand complex scenes with much greater success, and its interpretations are much more easily interpretable. Our system is able to capture meaningful statistical regularities in visual relationships and hence provide both improved performance and improved interpretability.",
        " The mode of development of a robot. If you make a new project for a robot to do something, then you've got to get a new style of recognizing the objects. And that's the subject of this paper. We present a novel framework for robustly estimating the 3D pose of objects from depth images with applications to robot manipulation and augmented reality. The method involves a two-stage procedure that uses a modified receptive field and point-cloud segmentation to detect objects in the image, and then refines the poses through a registration process that uses both local and global geometric features. And this all happens in real-time, so on a consumer-level system, which maintains a frame rate of 24 fps. We also demonstrate that the system works in real-world applications, implementing it for robot grasping and augmented reality, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard test sets, with an average precision of 93.7 percent and a translation error of 0.9 centimeters. The resulting seamless integration between the virtual and the physical world enables new forms of human-robot collaboration and augmented reality applications. The source code and pre-trained models are publicly available to support further research in this area.",
        " And now we turn to a brief summary of this paper, entitled, “Efficient Lasso Estimation of Time-series Using the Superlative in a High-Dimensional Space”: We are concerned with sparsely populated high-dimensional time-series models, where the number of free parameters is greater than the number of observations, and we focus on dependent data which satisfy two essential conditions: the -mixing property and the beta-mixing time-series dependence structure. We show that the Lasso estimator performs almost as well as in the case of independence, for beta-mixing with geometrical decay, whereas beta-mixing with polynomial decay imposes a further penalty. We establish both error bounds for the first and second moment and provide a sufficient condition for model selection consistency. We give asymptotic results, explicitly taking into account the mixing coefficients, and we show how the degree of decay in the time-series structure affects estimation accuracy. Our results extend the scope of the Lasso estimator for a wider class of time-series models than has previously been considered in the literature. Numerical simulations and an empirical application to financial time-series data support the validity of the theoretical conclusions and show the practical importance of our guarantees in a realistic situation where non-Gaussianity and temporal dependence coexist.",
        " It is an ill omen for the public, and their bodies are threatened. In this paper, we present an ad hoc framework for learning statistically interpretable physiological features from multiple sensors. Using a large-scale multi-day study of over 10,000 participants, we train these latent features from a mixture of heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and motion to capture essential physiological patterns that generalize across different subject populations, contexts, and health-related tasks. Our work paves the way for developing more robust, portable, and interpretable systems that can monitor wearable devices to detect and diagnose a range of diseases and health-related outcomes.",
        " -Attention, attention! It's time for high-resolution surveillance! Recent progress in deep learning has made great progress in superresolution. In this paper, we study the limitations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in enhancing low-resolution surveillance images. The results show that while GANs can produce believable superresolution images with a resolution increase of up to four times, they frequently add plausible but unreliable details in the critical identification features. We compare the performance of several GANs specially designed for upsampling surveillance images in different real-world data sets. Our quantitative analysis measures the objective quality of enhanced images, and the reliability of enhanced features based on human perception. This work provides a comprehensive assessment of the superresolution capabilities of deep learning, and establishes a practical boundary for its use in security and law enforcement. We also discuss the legal and ethical implications of using such technology in forensic cases, emphasizing the need for confidence metrics and appropriate guidelines for admissibility in trials.",
        " A new probabilistic framework is introduced for the solution of the color constancy problem. Rather than generating a single, exact estimate of the illuminant color, our method produces a complete probability distribution over possible illuminants, thereby capturing the inherent uncertainty of this ill-posed problem. Our results, evaluated on several standard color-contrasts, demonstrate that our approach is able to provide state-of-the-art illuminant estimates, as well as meaningful measures of confidence which correlate well with the likelihood of errors. We also demonstrate how these uncertainty estimates can be used in a principled manner to enhance the robustness of downstream vision tasks, such as object recognition and scene categorization under varying illumination conditions. The probabilistic framework presented herein offers a novel perspective on the fundamental limits of color constancy and points towards a principled framework for the design of future illuminant estimation strategies.",
        " This work examines the capacity of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks to learn morphological features of the brain for the purpose of detecting alzheimer's disease. Unlike previous work, which has been based on predetermined volumetric biomarkers, the goal of this study was to train deep learning methods to extract the minute changes in shape and the morphology of the brain. A particular 3D convolutional neural network with the aim of extracting shape features and a large number of geometrical objects, which have been developed to enable us to distinguish the hippocampus atrophy, the enlarged aqueduct, the thinning of the brain, was developed. The network learned hierarchical shape abstractions, focusing on the clinically relevant parts of the brain without any annotated training, and, most importantly, this method showed superior results to the volumetric biomarker-based methods, especially in the early stages of the disease. Our network is tested on a set of 1,200 T1-weighted MR images from the ADNI project. Our model is able to distinguish with 92.7% accuracy patients with alzheimer's disease from healthy controls, and 86.3% correctly predicts the onset of dementia within two years. The study suggests that 3D convolutional neural networks are capable of learning a shape-based representation of the brain that can effectively capture the complex structural changes in the brain that occur in the progression of alzheimer's disease and which might be able to be used for an earlier and more accurate diagnosis.",
        " Having identified the need for standardizing performance evaluation in a well-known area of machine learning, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark that addresses the need for a standard performance evaluation of the whole of a recommendation system. Its design is based on the complex patterns of computation that are involved in the training of modern recommendations and its implementation is designed for practical and industry use. It includes both training and inference and its metrics have been carefully calibrated to take into account real-world constraints such as latency, memory, and accuracy. The benchmark uses a set of representative data and workloads from the industry, while protecting the confidentiality of its users. Experimental results show that the benchmark can distinguish between system performance in a variety of different platforms from the cloud to edge devices. In addition, through a series of consultations with the industry, we have been able to develop a set of reference implementations on several platforms and frameworks, allowing fair comparisons between the various implementations. A thorough set of reports and reproducible experiments are included. The contribution of this paper to the MLPerf suite is to give the ML systems community a tool that will enable the optimization of recommendation systems, which account for a large proportion of the inference cycles of machine learning systems in industry today.",
        " With the nodes having the opportunity of being the parents of more than one node, the directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) allow to represent more complex decision boundaries, more ad hoc than the trees, and with a smaller number of nodes. The performance of the sparse DAGs in the experiments is better than in the case of the decision trees. The sparsity of the model also allows a better visualization and an easier interpretation of the decision process. In this work, an efficient learning algorithm for these structures, which uses regularizations to prevent overfitting and encourage re-use of features on decision paths, is presented. This paper provides both theoretical guarantees on the expressive power of sparse DAGs and practical guidelines for their implementation in various classification tasks.",
        " On analyzing the relationship between comorbidities as they vary in time and among individuals, there remains a great problem for the physiologists. This article presents a new method for learning dynamic and individualized comorbidity networks from longitudinal records. The model takes into account patient-related features for personalizing comorbidity networks, thereby allowing heterogeneity among different groups of patients with different phenotypes and clinical profiles. In experiments on large-scale health care data, the authors show that their method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for predicting future diseases, and provides insights into how comorbidities develop and interact over time. Our work contributes a powerful framework for analyzing complex temporal event data in health care, with potential applications to clinical decision support and population health management. The dynamic network structures that are learned enable identification of temporal patterns in the development of comorbidities, which are not captured in static models, thereby providing opportunities for improving risk stratification and personalization in health care.",
        " In this article, the problem of identifying fish species in the diverse conditions of underwater space is addressed through a multi-stage process. Fish images are first subjected to pre-processing to remove noise and distortion, and then to segmentation using an adaptive thresholding approach to separate the fish from the complex backgrounds. The fish are then classified using a neural network and a decision tree. It is found that the combined method is able to achieve 94.7% accuracy in recognizing fish species, with a classification accuracy that is far superior to the classification accuracy of single-classifier methods. A comprehensive set of features is extracted, including shape descriptors, texture patterns, and color distributions. The most discriminative features are then selected using correlation-based feature selection and information gain criterion. Moreover, the classification system presented in this article shows good robustness to variations in illumination, angle, and occlusion, making it suitable for practical applications in marine biology research, fisheries management, and the study of the marine environment. The neural network is able to cope with complex feature relations, and the decision tree provides a way of obtaining interpretable rules for classification.",
        " Graph Neural Networks have recently been shown to be a powerful architecture for learning on graphs, but so far they have all been hand-tuned by hand. This paper introduces a general framework for automatic evolution of graph neural networks. Using a policy of reinforcement learning, our method explores the vast space of graph neural network architectures, including different combinations of aggregation functions, sampling strategies, and inter-layer connections. The search uncovers interesting patterns in the evolution of the structure of the network and in the evolution of the functioning of the network. Extensive experiments on a variety of graph data tasks show that our method automatically discovers new architectures that achieve a higher accuracy than hand-crafted architectures on node classification, graph classification, and link prediction tasks. Our method provides new insights into the design of the GNNs and establishes a framework for discovering task-appropriate GNN architectures. Finally, our experiments show that the Auto-GNN method is much more efficient than the existing GNN architecture search methods, while obtaining a better model.",
        " THE PRESENT PAPER DEALS WITH NEUTRAL STRUCTURE SEARCH (NeS) – a powerful new method for designing efficient object-detection models. The main idea is that many of the candidate architectures have in common the intermediate feature representations that have been computed during the evaluation, and that these intermediate feature representations can be shared between the candidate architectures rather than recomputed. Our formalization of this insight is the Representation-Sharing Graph (RSG), which is used to identify and eliminate duplicate computations between the candidate architectures. Our method was tested on the COCO dataset, where it achieved 42.3 mAP with the cost of only 0.8 days of GPU computation. This is a great step forward in making neural architecture search more practical and applicable for real-world applications in computer vision. We also show that our representation-sharing methodology generalizes beyond object detection to other computer-vision tasks such as instance segmentation and keypoint detection.",
        " This paper describes the Graph-Learned Neural Network (GLN), a novel method for learning the structure of graphs. Unlike the usual method of forcing a pre-set graph topology, the GLN traces the topology of a network from a complex network of relations. It optimizes the performance of the graph with respect to the expected utility of future tasks. Our experiments on a variety of real-world datasets, including social, molecular, and citation networks, have demonstrated that GLN has higher performance than previous methods with fixed topologies. GLN particularly excels in situations where the structure of the network is not perfectly known; GLN can achieve up to 23% reduction in error and 15% improvement in accuracy in tasks requiring the re-construction of partial data. Furthermore, the learned topologies can be interpreted to provide insights into the underlying relations of the data.",
        " The problem of analyzing the content of surveillance pictures, which is to break up the picture into the different semantic classes (person, car, road), is a very laborious one. Unlike fully supervised methods which require the labelling of all the individual frames, we propose a novel framework of weakly supervised learning which requires only one frame per movie, which uses temporal consistency and spatial neighbourhood to propagate the features of the one frame to the whole sequence. Extensive experiments on several surveillance images show that the classification accuracy is comparable with that of the fully supervised methods, and the laborious annotations required are reduced by an order of magnitude. We use a dual-stage architecture which simultaneously learns from the sparse data available and exploits the similarities in appearance between the different frames. Our method also includes temporal regularization to enforce consistency between successive frames while allowing for natural scene changes. Moreover, our method is robust to the camera’s motion and the variations in lighting, making it especially suitable for real-world surveillance applications.",
        " “This paper presents a new hybrid model for simulating the human cardiovascular system using Neural FMUs. The physics-based models capture the known hemodynamic principles by means of differential equations, whereas the neural networks learn the complex patient-related patterns from clinical data. The hybrid model combines these two approaches. The hybrid model is evaluated with both synthetic and clinical measurements of patients with different cardiac conditions. It is shown that the hybrid model achieves 37% less prediction error than the physics-based models, and 65% less training data than the data-driven models. We also show that the hybrid framework can be implemented using the FMI standard, which enables interoperable and modular simulations of the human cardiovascular system.” This work lays the foundation for a future personalized heart model that combines the knowledge of physics with the flexibility of machine learning, and that enables accurate diagnosis, treatment planning and real-time monitoring in clinical settings. In addition, the model retains its physiological consistency even when extrapolating beyond the training range, which is essential for clinical applications.",
        " This paper proposes a novel way to predict events in a time series, namely the Evolutionary State Graph (ESG). The main feature of the ESG is that it can model the evolution of the state of the time series, and the transitions between states, a type of recurrent process. It combines local dependencies with global structure by using a neural network with attention to model the relative importance of historical states. This system adapts to concept drift and changes in the pattern of time series. The ESG is constantly evolving with new data and can be used to predict future events. This model works well for the inter-states dependencies and irregularly sampled time series, which makes it applicable to a wide range of real-world time series event prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on financial transactions, medical events and social media data show that the ESG significantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art methods. Prediction accuracy increases on average by 17.3 percent and the F1 score by 22.1 percent.",
        " Nonlinear profile monitoring in high-dimensional data sets is an important task for a company that wishes to monitor the quality of its products and prevent non-linearity. To address this problem, this paper presents a new approach to nonlinear profile monitoring in high-dimensional data sets by using deep probabilistic autoencoders. Experiments on simulated and real manufacturing data sets show that the deep probabilistic framework detects process variations more accurately and at lower false alarm rates than other approaches such as functional principal component analysis and shallow autoencoders. Our approach outperforms conventional techniques such as principal component analysis and shallow autoencoders in various performance metrics. This paper presents a computationally efficient, interpretable and robust solution to the challenging problem of nonlinear profile monitoring in high-dimensional data sets that arise in modern manufacturing processes. The proposed method is especially useful for monitoring complex spatial and temporal profiles in the fabrication of semiconductors, automobile assembly and other advanced manufacturing processes where traditional approaches fail to capture complex nonlinear patterns.",
        " “We propose DISK (Deep Interest-based Spatial Keypoints), a novel method for learning local feature descriptors and detectors using policy gradient reinforcement learning. Our framework is designed to enable end-to-end learning without needing ground truth annotations of features, using the quality of the matching as a reward signal. The policy network learns to select discriminative local features, and the descriptor network extracts robust features invariant to changes in viewpoint, lighting and other image transformations. Our method performs well on challenging image matching tasks involving extreme view changes and regions with low texture. In our extensive experiments on KITTI and ETH we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in these tasks, especially for scenes with extreme viewpoint changes and regions with low texture. Our code and pre-trained models are released to the public to facilitate further research in this direction.”",
        " The goal of this paper is to introduce a new framework, Bi-GANs-ST, for perceptual image super-resolution. In particular, unlike conventional super-resolution methods that aim to minimize only pixel-level errors, our method aims to produce perceptually pleasing high-resolution images by constraining the mapping direction of the low-resolution image and the high-resolution image. Our framework features two GANs that operate in opposite directions, one for the low-resolution image and the other for the high-resolution image, allowing a cycle-consistency that greatly increases the accuracy and stability of the training. Bi-GANs-ST outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of perceptual metrics, producing high-quality images with realistic details while producing comparable PSNR and SSIM scores. Our method fills the gap between the perceptual and the mathematical fidelity of super-resolution, and has a strong potential to be applied to the synthesis of visual data.",
        " The objective of the present work is to introduce a new method of combining the gradient sketching method with distributed SGD in order to achieve a reducing communication overhead without loss of convergence guarantees. In this way, the efficiency of the system will be improved. During the experimental tests, it has been found that, in a certain way, the combined system of sketching and distributed SGD can reduce the communication overhead by up to 95%, which has little impact on the quality of the learning results. Our method is to reduce the communication overhead before sending the gradient through a randomized dimensionality reduction, which can reduce the communication overhead and not reduce the accuracy of the learning results significantly...... , gradient sketching is a promising method for distributed learning. Moreover, it is proved that the combination of sketching and distributed SGD can be successfully used in real-time systems with high-order network interference.",
        " Stepwise regression unsupervised learning, which we have called Stepwise Regression Unsupervised Learning, is a method which recognizes latent structures in the data by treating each feature as a potential dependent variable, and the other features as the predictors. Stepwise regression has been used only in supervised learning; and we prove that its principal principle, the elimination of the least significant terms in the regression function, can be turned into a device for unsupervised dimensionality reduction and pattern discovery. Using the bidirectional elimination process, we can make an optimum feature set which preserves the latent structure of the data. On a wide range of data sets, our method outperforms traditional unsupervised methods like principal components analysis and t-SNE, and it offers a better explanation of the relationship between the features than black-box methods. This new method, which is based on the mathematical foundations of regression, is a powerful tool for unsupervised learning, especially for high-dimensional data, where it is important to understand the features.",
        " This is a paper which studies the problems of obtaining abstentions without disparities in classifications. It has been shown that the lack of interrelation between abstention and the fairness is the subject of considerable study in the present day, but in the absence of further such study, the proper design of such classifications has remained unexplored. This paper formulates the problem of abstention under the fairness problem, and proposes a novel constrained optimization method for selectively abstaining from classifications when confidence is low, and at the same time, maintaining the rate of abstention and the error rate for all the protected groups. In the theoretical analysis, the results of the Pareto-optimization of the solutions are proven to achieve Pareto-optimality in terms of accuracy and fairness. Furthermore, this paper gives practical guidelines for implementing fair abstention in various application contexts where both uncertainty awareness and fairness are important. Empirical evaluation on the datasets of the three fields of medicine, criminal justice and finance has shown that the method can reduce the disparities of classifications based on the difference between the protected and unprotected groups.",
        " The answer lies in a combined spatial-temporal learning architecture, whereby spatio-temporal blocks extract the relevant features from the positions and velocities of the pedestrians in a series of images. The long-short-term memory then captures the resulting dependencies between events. The architecture, with its efficiency of computation, produces more accurate predictions of trajectories, and is thus well suited to real-time applications in driverless cars, in the observation of humans and in social robots. We test it on the ETH and UCY datasets, demonstrating an average accuracy of 18.2% and a final error of 21.5%, compared to state-of-the-art methods.",
        " In contrast to earlier approaches that process semantic information as a single stream, our two-stage architecture segregates the processing of shapes from the processing of texture. The shape-channel, regulated by a learnable gating mechanism, is exclusively concerned with shape-related information and remains insensitive to variations in appearance. Gated-SCNN: Gated-Shape Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation In our experiments, the new approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the cityscapes and coco-stuff datasets, especially in the identification of boundaries and the recognition of thin structures. Gated-SCNN requires significantly less memory and is computationally more efficient than existing models. The loss function for the shape-channel encourages consistency between the boundaries of objects to be identified with the shape predicted by the model, which in turn improves the boundary-detection. The proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness of a dedicated channel for the processing of shapes in semantic segmentation tasks, especially in the context of cityscapes that are crowded with many different object classes.",
        " This paper is an in-depth analysis of the invariance of the most recent object detection frameworks, and presents a performance upper bound for their best case performance on different classes of images. Using a novel error analysis framework, we decompose the detection errors into four distinct types: localization errors, classification errors, missed detections and false positives, and show that localization accuracy remains the main bottleneck in current architectures. Our results show that although recent detectors have improved considerably, they still fall short of the theoretical maximum performance and there is still an estimated 15% to 20% improvement potential before an architectural rethink is required. Our invariance analysis quantifies the robustness of the current detectors to common image transformations, and reveals a significant view-point sensitivity for all the systems. Finally, we propose a diagnostic test that highlights the specific classes of images where existing systems have difficulties. We offer guidance to the research community on how to address these limitations.",
        " \"Random walks in a neural network for learning tasks on graphs: RandomWalkNet.\" Abstract: RandomWalkNet is a novel neural network framework to enhance GNN inputs by randomly sampling random walks of various lengths in the input graph. RandomWalkNet then enhances node features by combining these walks with existing neural network inputs before being processed by a GNN. We have extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks including citation, social, and molecular graphs, and show that RandomWalkNet outperforms all existing GNN architectures on node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, especially for graphs with complex structure and long-range dependencies. By encoding both local connections and global graph topology, RandomWalkNet creates an enriched initial representation that can overcome the limitations of traditional message-passing GNNs. RandomWalkNet also offers a conceptually simple yet effective way to improve the performance of a GNN without modifying its underlying architecture. In particular, our ablation studies show that RandomWalkNet augments GNN mechanisms with complementary information rather than merely adding more nodes to the network.",
        " The construction of effective chemometric representations is a fundamental problem in the field of drug discovery. Here we describe a self-supervised method that learns from a large number of unlabelled molecules to build chemometric features. Our method, MolRep, uses a contrastive learning framework to extract the intrinsic chemical and structural properties of the molecules without needing expensive, labeled examples. Our feature extraction shows significant improvement over both fingerprint-based and deep learning methods in all tasks, improving average performance by a factor of up to 15–20%. Using unlabelled molecules from the PubChem and ZINC repositories, we trained MolRep and performed a detailed performance assessment on several downstream tasks. Our results show that our method can be used to successfully predict the secondary structure of molecules, a critical task in the discovery of new drugs. The low-data capability of MolRep makes it suitable for the early stages of drug discovery, when scarce labelled data are available.",
        " This work proposes a method of converting 3D Lidar point clouds into a very high-quality color panorama image, while preserving semantic information between the two modalities. It consists of a two-stage network: a pre-processor extracts geometric and contextual features while preserving semantic segmentation information; then, a generative network generates images and the corresponding semantic maps. We performed extensive experiments on various types of urban and natural scenes and found that our method outperforms other methods in terms of visual quality metrics, semantic accuracy and consistency between the two modalities. We propose a novel semantic consistency loss that ensures the consistency of object classes and spatial relationships across domains, and a model for generating images and restoring occlusions. Our method enables the fusion of 3D and visual information, which can be used in the perception of an unmanned vehicle, in virtual reality applications, and in the augmentation of multi-modal data.",
        " This paper addresses the difficult problem of visual place recognition in gardens, which are a particular difficulty because of the seasonal changes, regrowth of vegetation, and similarity of repetitive structure. It presents a new data set, GardenNet, containing over twenty thousand images, taken in fifteen gardens in various weather conditions and in the course of seasons spanning two years. The images are geographically and temporally referenced, allowing for the evaluation of methods in natural, time-variant environments. The paper evaluates several current methods for visual place recognition on this new data set, including both traditional methods and neural nets, and finds that the best results are obtained for short-term place recognition, but that they struggle with seasonal and long-term changes. GardenMatch, a convolutional neural network that concentrates on garden features that persist over time and minimizes the influence of transient features, shows the best results. This paper thus sheds light on the particular difficulties posed by the environment of gardens in visual place recognition and lays a foundation for future research in this field. The GardenMatch method obtains an average 78% recall and 76% precision under difficult cross-seasonal conditions, an improvement over existing methods of an average of 23%.",
        " »On Learning Sets of Symmetric Elements« br /> This paper deals with the theoretical foundations and practical applications of learning procedures for sets of symmetric elements. It presents a novel learning procedure which exploits symmetry properties to improve both the speed and the expressiveness of machine learning models for sets. Our experimental studies on point clouds, molecular structures and multi-object scenes show that our symmetric set learning procedure significantly outperforms conventional deep learning architectures on both synthetic and real-world data, while providing more interpretable results. In theoretical analysis, we derive bounds for generalization which are dependent on the symmetry properties of the learned sets rather than the size of the sets. The conclusions of this paper are that symmetry properties offer a promising direction for the development of more powerful and efficient learning procedures for sets with many practical applications.",
        " I describe the work, which makes use of a convolution neural network, and which is the result of a novel and original study. It consists of a method of fast and correct synthesis of high-resolution three-dimensional images, by means of an adaptation of the connections between the units. We have constructed a re-designed network, which uses dynamically changing weights, and also a mechanism for controlling the strength of the convolutions according to the content of the images. Our method is particularly suitable for scenes with great detail and frequent changes in depth. The result has a high value in applications such as augmented reality, robotics, and scene understanding, where the speed and accuracy of the images are critical. Extensive experiments have been performed, and show that our method is 3.5 times faster than state-of-the-art methods, while producing better results: depth accuracy improved by 17% and structural similarity by 12%.",
        " FINGAT, a new financial based attention network, tries to predict a top-k stock by integrating several sources of data – historical prices, fundamental data, stock-market sentiment, inter-stock relations based on industry, suppliers, and market interrelationships. experiments based on five years of stock-market data show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, FINGAT achieves higher risk-adjusted performance and prediction accuracy, especially during periods of market volatility. In addition, an ablation study shows that the attention mechanism, based on a hierarchical attention, is very important to model performance, especially during periods of market volatility. . The paper offers both theoretical insights into financial deep learning and practical insights into investment decision making.",
        " Not taking up with the numerical quantities, which form the basis of most of the methods of modeling, we apply to the concept of locomotion, the coregionalized locomotion, which is supposed to establish a mathematical correspondence between dissimilar spaces of locomotion in order to find underlying common principles of movement. This method allows to reveal previously unknown commonalities between different kinds of movement strategies, and to transfer knowledge from one domain to another. Using examples of human gait analysis, robot locomotion and animal movement, we demonstrate how this qualitative approach reveals previously unknown commonalities between movements and facilitates the transfer of knowledge between different domains. This method uses a Gaussian mixture to simulate the complex interactions between movement and environment.",
        " The purpose of this article is to present DuPLO, a novel dual-perspective deep learning architecture for time series classification, which combines the global and local views of the time series through a two-layered network. We show that it is possible to detect time-series-related features from two different perspectives in time-series classification. DuPLO can simultaneously learn macro-level features and micro-level features. Various experiments on various time-series data sets have been conducted, and it has been shown that DuPLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods on most of them, achieving an average increase of 4.3% in classification accuracy. The global stream can detect macro-level patterns and long-term dependencies through dilated convolutions, while the local stream can detect micro-level features through attention mechanisms and special temporal filters. DuPLO can be used in applications ranging from disease monitoring to industrial anomaly detection. Subsequent ablation experiments show that the two perspectives complement each other, and can overcome the weakness of the global perspective for all time-series classification tasks, including those with sparse training data.",
        " Variational Empowerment Representation Learning (VERL) clusters states that have high mutual information regarding an agent's future influence in a meaningful way. By maximizing the agent's power over the environment, we obtain state and goal representations that capture the underlying action-related structure of the environment. Variational Empowerment as Representation Learning for Reward-based Reinforcement Learning is a variational method for efficiently learning a policy that combines state and action representations for the reward-based reinforcement learning method. Experimental results in a variety of environments with different visual structures and different reward structures show that VERL significantly outperforms other existing methods in the task of reaching a goal. Moreover, we have learned the learning of effective policies and effective representations. Empowerment-based representations capture the controllability of the environment while ignoring the irrelevance of the environment. In reinforcement learning, it is very suitable for hierarchical and transfer learning.",
        " This paper introduces a new method for evaluating the quality of the 3D reconstruction and mapping systems, without the use of reference data. The proposed method is based on internal consistency measurements on the reconstructed model itself, derived from the geometric coherence, topological continuity and consistency of texture across multiple viewpoints. The proposed method is evaluated on a wide range of test data, including indoor and outdoor scenes, and object-level models, and shows strong correlations with human ratings. Using cross-validation, the internal consistency of the reconstructed models is evaluated to determine the consistency and adequacy of the models. The method is intended to be used in unconstrained and real-world conditions where it is difficult or impossible to obtain ground truth.",
        " Approaching the visual coherence of a composition through attention is a rather well-known task in the field of art-representation. We introduce a novel method, whose cognition is based on a transformer, which is able to render relationships between disparate elements and at the same time preserve their individual semantic meanings. We call this method Transform-the-Set. Experimental results show that TTS outperforms other methods in standard metrics like Fréchet-Inception-Distance and in visual evaluation. In a supervised learning scenario, TTS is able to produce 87% matching of the guiding points and to preserve visual coherence. The memory-attentive mechanism is particularly effective for large and diverse inputs, producing intriguing collages from as many as 25 visual elements. This advance in computational creativity opens new possibilities for both professional and non-professional users to conceive and create personal content.",
        " The generative models are proposed to integrate different data sources and inferential tools. Our generative model addresses these problems by learning a unified latent representation that captures both the common structure and the distinctive properties of the various data sources. They show that the model provides robust inference for tabular, textual, visual, and temporal data, outperforms specialized, single-source methods on a variety of benchmarks, and significantly improves prediction accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and interpretability over methods that treat the data sources in isolation. The model is based on a hierarchical Bayesian structure, which encodes each modality in a specialized way and performs cross-modal inference using a single latent space. They provide theoretical guarantees on the consistency of inference and a practical implementation that scales to large-scale, real-world inference tasks. The model also shows strong performance in the weak-training setting, in which a limited amount of data is available.",
        " The author says that the best learning method for this kind of data is the semi-global, owing to the high bias and the low cost. They have a great success in object recognition and classification. In the experiments, they showed that they could achieve a high level of accuracy in object recognition and classification in ImageNet, which was much higher than the accuracy of other methods. On a number of image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation experiments, they achieved higher accuracy than other methods. Then they analyzed the results and found that the proposed method requires fewer weights and fewer parameters, and is more resilient to the transformation of the distribution. The new method can improve the performance of visual recognition systems.",
        " Having, therefore, examined the above subject, we proceed to describe NICE, a new method of producing counterfactuals. NICE is based on a simple rule which identifies the minimum number of feature modifications required to transform the query instance into a counterfactual which will alter the classification. Our method will identify the minimal set of feature modifications required to transform the query instance into a counterfactual which will closely resemble an observation in the training set. Our experiments on diverse data sets have shown that NICE will produce a significantly higher number of counterfactuals with respect to the resemblance to the training set, compared to the current state-of-the-art, whilst maintaining a good level of efficiency. Furthermore, our user experiments have shown that NICE produces explanations which are both more plausible and more useful to the human decision-maker. This work thus contributes to the rapidly developing field of explainable artificial intelligence by providing interpretable, realistic explanations which are effectively exploitable in decision-critical applications.",
        " Of a crowd, of a hundred persons, of a hundred heads a man. A big, multiform crowd, counting two thousand and one hundred heads in five thousand images. The recent progress in deep learning-based approaches to this problem, notwithstanding, the size and diversity of the available images, still constitutes a limitation to a complete evaluation of these problems. However, unlike previous crowd datasets, we have annotated precise head locations, which enables us to simultaneously evaluate counting accuracy and localization performance. Unlike previous crowd datasets, the images come from a wide range of environments, expositions, lighting conditions and crowd densities (from few to many), collected in the field, from different countries. We have defined a precise protocol of evaluation, and new metrics that remedy the drawbacks of measures such as mean absolute error and mean square error. We use these metrics to compare the performance of several of the most important crowd counting and localization methods, and our evaluations reveal a new standard for crowd-counting and crowd-participation tasks, as well as important insights for the development of more robust and generalizable methods. Extensive experiments with the best available methods point to future research needs and directions, in particular with respect to handling extreme variations in density and achieving more precise localization.",
        " Our new framework for a comparative performance-explainability-benchmarking of machine learning methods is applied to multivariate time series classification. Whereas conventional performance-based frameworks have been built primarily on predictivity and generalization, we consider explainability as well, as the need for transparent and interpretable models is escalating. We systematically evaluate different multivariate time series classifiers across a range of multivariate time series classification problems, evaluating both their accuracy and their explainability. We find that the performance and explainability of different families of classifiers can be strongly influenced by the model used. Deep learning methods can often produce highly accurate models, but often lack interpretability, whereas decision tree and rule-based methods may provide more interpretability, albeit at a small cost in accuracy. Our framework quantifies explainability by measuring various facets such as feature clarity, temporal importance, decision boundary clarity, and the complexity of generating explanations. In doing so, we identify the key research areas that are needed to better reconcile the dual aims of high accuracy and interpretability in time series analysis. This work provides a structured methodology for practitioners to choose the most appropriate classifier based on their application- and explainability-related requirements.",
        " This paper introduces a new method for dealing with the long-tailed problem of classification, which consists in analyzing and controlling the momentum effect in the optimization dynamics. We find that in the long-tailed setting, the momentum effect in gradient descent has both a positive and a negative effect: it speeds up the learning for the head classes while increasing the bias for the tail classes. A thorough theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method, selective momentum calibration, can effectively balance the efficiency of learning and the fairness of classification. Experimental results on long-tailed datasets CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist show that our method improves the performance of the head classes by up to 4% and that of the tail classes by up to 8%, and this with a small loss of accuracy in the head classes. We show that our method can be easily incorporated into existing architectures and learning strategies, and that it can effectively deal with the long-tailed problem of classification.",
        " DESCRIPTION: This paper presents a novel distributed model-free method for multi-hop ride-sharing systems based on deep reinforcement learning. This method allows vehicles to learn independently to pick up and drop off passengers without needing explicit modeling of the underlying transportation dynamics. Distribution guarantees robustness against network failures and reduces the overhead of centralized approaches. We implement a distributed architecture in which each vehicle operates as an independent agent with a deep neural network for local observations and learning, and jointly optimizes system-wide objectives such as minimizing the wait time of passengers, reducing unused travel time, and increasing the sharing rate. Extensive experiments on a large number of real world data sets show that the performance of our method is 18% higher in terms of the number of rides and 23% higher in terms of the efficiency of the system. Our results suggest that model-free reinforcement learning may be a promising approach to dealing with complex transportation optimization problems in dynamic urban environments.",
        " This paper explains the use of graph-representation learning to predict outcomes in health care. A framework was developed in which patients, treatments, diagnoses and clinical events were interconnected nodes in a heterogeneous graph-based structure, and this framework was applied to a diverse set of clinical data to capture complex relationships and the temporal dependencies that are frequently overlooked in traditional predictive models. On the basis of a sensitivity analysis, the authors demonstrate that the method significantly improves the prediction of mortality by 17% and the length of stay by 12%. They also describe a number of graph-representation learning architectures and evaluate them on a multi-site data set consisting of 47,362 patient records. The results show that the graph-representation learning method was useful in identifying the patients most likely to be readmitted within 30 days (AUROC 0.83, 95% CI 0.80–0.83). These results show that graph-representation learning can effectively capture the network-like structure of clinical data and could therefore enhance clinical decision support and help to personalize care. A detailed investigation of the attention mechanisms in the learned network revealed clinically meaningful patterns in the weighting of different patient features.",
        " As the only way to determine the speed of a vehicle is by measuring the speed, the standard and established methods of measuring the speed of a vehicle are ordinarily applied to the more or less extended series of wheels. This paper presents a new approach to the estimation of the speed of a vehicle. This approach consists in a multi-stage procedure in which the speed is first estimated by a regression method from the motion of the vehicle and the position of the wheels in order to obtain a rough solution for the speed of the vehicle, and from there by geometrical operations a six-degree-of-freedom pose is reconstructed. Our work suggests that modelling explicitly a structured intermediate representation is a promising way to improve the monocular 3D perception tasks, beyond vehicle pose estimation. Our extensive experiments on the KITTI, ApolloCar3D and nuScenes datasets show that the proposed structure is able to capture geometric cues that are crucial for a correct estimation of the pose of the vehicle, especially under difficult conditions, such as occlusions and varying illumination.",
        " Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable successes in various vision tasks. Their computational cost and their memory requirements are often too high to permit of their deployment on devices that have no great memory or computational power. The purpose of this paper is to devise a new method for learning low-rank approximations of the convolutional layers of such networks, thereby reducing the complexity of the network while preserving the performance. This method reduces the memory requirement of the convolutional layers by a factor of five or more, with almost no degradation in accuracy, on popular architectures such as ResNet and MobileNet. Our models trained with our method are also more robust on reduced data than are those trained with standard pruning techniques. We conclude that this method provides a useful solution for deploying powerful convolutional neural networks on mobile and embedded devices, without requiring any hardware acceleration.",
        " “This paper presents a novel deep learning-based method for the automatic measurement of hard disk drive head height. This method replaces the manual measurement of the thickness of the head coating and reduces the measurement time from several hours to several seconds, while maintaining the accuracy of the traditional thickness measurement to within  0.5nm. The proposed method can be successfully implemented in a production environment, and the test time is reduced by 96%, and the test efficiency is improved by a factor of 2, which has the potential to increase the test speed and reduce the measurement delay. The proposed method is trained with 15,000 cross-sectional TEM images and thickness measurements, and the test error is 0.32nm. The automatic measurement method is an important progress in the field of precision manufacturing in the disk drive industry, and has a broad application potential in other fields of thin-film thickness measurement.",
        " And then he leaped away from the camp, he was last seen in the morning at school, then he had to change places with another class, in which he was again a pupil. The main object of this paper is to suggest an efficient method for dealing with the difficulty of preserving the knowledge of previous object classes, while learning new ones. This method is based on a TRD-Net which consists of three separate collaborating networks: a teacher network which preserves the knowledge of previous classes, a student network which learns new classes, and a residual network which captures the information gaps between them. Extensive experiments on the datasets of Pascal VOC and MSCOCO have shown that this method significantly outperforms existing incremental methods. The main innovation is the two-level residual distillation mechanism which operates both on features and on the output of a classifier. At the feature level, residual distillation preserves the discriminative feature representations, while at the output level, it maintains the confidence level of classifiers and the accuracy of localization. Furthermore, our method shows remarkable performance on challenging tasks where there are large class increments and limited exemplar storage, making it suitable for practical applications with severe memory constraints.",
        " Projection and Dual-Projection Generative Adversarial Neural Networks for Conditional Image Generation This paper proposes the use of a dual-projection neural network for the generation of images of a given class, introducing a novel framework that operates in two complementary embedding spaces. The generator uses a projection to map the latent to the class-representative manifold, while the discriminator uses an orthogonal projection to evaluate both image quality and the consistency of the class. Two ablation studies have been carried out and the result shows that the proposed dual-projection mechanism is significantly better than both single-projection alternatives and traditional conditioning methods. This dual-projection framework overcomes mode collapse and class consistency issues, which hampered previous approaches to conditional generative adversarial networks. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA that DP-GANs achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and the Inception Score (IS). This work not only improves the visual quality and the accuracy of the generated images, but also has superior learning stability and convergence speed, making it a good solution for all conditional image generation tasks.",
        " A language researcher's statement: \"If you've read The Observer, or seen that a fly flies in from the sidewalk, he's a stooge, he's a stooge of a stooge.\" He then showed that he could interpret it as an adage.... Our approach, based on a contrastive learning method, tries to extract discriminant features that distinguish the different semantic meanings of the two words that refer to the same entity. By comparing them with three popular data sets, we show that this method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for synonym detection, resolution of referents and elicitation. This result can be used both in the field of computational linguistics and in the field of psychology. It is possible to get a clearer picture of how people choose between alternative referring expressions and how to help the machine understand better referential language. Qualitative analysis also shows that our model is very successful in capturing pragmatic choices in the formulation of the RE, the relevance of the context and the variation of the speakers.",
        " Outlier detection is a fundamental task of machine learning, with a variety of applications such as fraud detection, anomaly detection, and data quality control. It has long been thought that for good outlier detection, it is essential to learn representations from the data of the problem domain, so as to capture the subtle distribution of normal instances. But this is not so. With this paper, we conducted a large number of experiments on various domains and instances, and found that the representations learned from a foundation network are often as good as or even better than those from a domain. The results show that for many cases, domain knowledge is not necessary for outlier detection, which is an important direction for research. The main reason is that the foundation network captures rich semantic information, and the representations can be reused across domains. I will then discuss how this has important implications for the design and deployment of outlier detection systems in real-world applications.",
        " Reveal the essential ideas of the paper: In this paper, we propose a new method for the estimation of initial pose from the images and videos of a human, which ensures a more accurate and exacting estimation of the poses and an accurate and precise estimation of the poses and angles, which is then calibrated. The result is a pose calibration framework which makes it possible to obtain an accurate 3D reconstruction of the human figure. There is a temporal convolutional network which represents the temporal relationships between the different frames, and a transformation of the nodes which enables the estimation of the relations between the frames. We also rely on the anatomical relationships between the body parts, which are deduced from the knowledge of the relationship between the joints. Compared with the state of the art, our method reduces the error of the joints by an average of 11.3 per cent, and the Procrustes-comparable error by a mean of 87 per cent. The code and the models that have been used in the training of the network will be made public, in order to facilitate the development of further research. The model shows its greatest strength in the most difficult cases of complex poses, occlusions and rapid movements.",
        " How old are you? Face age translation with identity preservation by GANs: This paper describes a novel method of face age translation by means of a generative adversarial network. Our aim is to preserve the individual features of the faces while ageing or rejuvenating them. Our model does this by introducing a multi-strategy loss function and an identity-preserving regularization, which produces age-translations with a high degree of realism and identity preservation across a wide range of ages (from children to old people). The experiments show that our method outperforms previous methods in terms of visual quality and identity preservation. Our method is tested on a number of different datasets, such as MORPH, CACD, and FG-NET, and we show that it performs better than previous methods in terms of both the visual quality and the consistency. Our method has potential applications in entertainment, missing persons, and security systems that need to handle ageing. The quantitative evaluation of identity preservation by face verification algorithms confirms that after age transformation, the identity of the original subject can be recognized very well, with a 94.6% success rate.",
        " Detection, localization, and description of multiple changes with a single system. Our method is based on a dual encoder transformer framework that performs a pairwise parallel search, followed by a cross-attention mechanism for fine-grained localization. It detects changes not only in pairs of images but also in images of a given depth, and this makes it possible to address change in three different ways: localization, characterization, and description. During experiments on the Mir-score-A dataset, the system is able to handle multiple changes with different types and sizes with a high level of confidence. Detailed natural language descriptions of changes are also generated by using attentional masks, enabling a very high level of accuracy for the localization and characterization of the change, as well as the localization of changes. Our method is able to effectively analyze visual change and support applications in surveillance, remote sensing, and robots. In addition, a new dataset containing different images with multiple changes is presented.",

We introduce the method of bootstrap latent-predictive representations. We evaluate it in a variety of multi-problem multi-stage learning situations and, compared to existing methods, obtain better performance and improved efficiency in the learning process. A theoretical analysis establishes the formal connection between the state estimation error and the estimation error of the value function, revealing why bootstrap-learned state representations are useful for policy learning. We suggest that bootstrap latent-predictive learning is a promising way to construct general-purpose state representations that allow efficient reinforcement learning over a set of related tasks.",

The extensive experiments on the VERI, VIN, and CITYFLOW data sets show that the model outperforms the state of the art, with improvements of 5.2% in average precision and 3.8% in rank-one accuracy. Ablation experiments show that the model relies significantly on the attention mechanism and the meta-information for its success in real-world surveillance. To improve performance, the model uses a meta-information that ranks the results of visual matching in the presence of a label corresponding to the manufacturer, color, and type of the vehicle, and then on the title.",
        " Our paper proposes the Geometry Sharing Network (GSNet) for 3D point cloud classification and segmentation. Unlike previous methods, which mainly rely on local feature extraction, GSNet takes the geometry of point clouds as the basic input and generates an unsupervised hierarchical geometry-aware module to efficiently extract geometric information from the whole point cloud, forming a hierarchy of features. All experiments on the popular 3D point cloud data sets ModelNet, ShapeNet, and S3DIS show that GSNet has achieved the best performance for both classification and segmentation, and it has greatly improved the discrimination of objects with complex shapes and fine details, while maintaining the efficiency of deep learning. The proposed architecture consists of three key parts: (1) the geometry extraction unit, which extracts features with unique geometric characteristics; (2) the multi-scale geometric feature sharing module, which can transfer geometric knowledge from different resolutions; and (3) the hybridization block, which is able to learn both local and global geometric features. The results show that it is effective to explicitly consider geometry sharing in 3D point cloud understanding, and deep learning methods for 3D point clouds are further developed.",

We demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple 3D understanding tasks, including object classification, component segmentation, and scene semantic segmentation. We also show that the features have complementary natures, and thus they are useful for solving tasks involving complex objects and varying point densities. Finally, we conduct feature ablation studies to show that the global context features significantly enhance the local features without significantly increasing the computation, making our method suitable for real-world 3D vision applications.",
        " This paper introduces the DSIC, a novel feature-level fusion method which adapts the feature fusion strategy to the input sample. In contrast to the conventional static approach which only enables a fixed feature fusion strategy for all samples, DSIC allows for the dynamic selection of the best feature fusion strategy for each input sample.

Unifying Non-Locality for Neural Nets Non-Local Operation for Neural Networks. We will not only simplify the implementation of the attention mechanism in neural architectures, but also gain theoretical insights into the advantages of non-locality in a variety of machine-learning tasks. Then, analyzing the computations that are created by the different blocks, we will also show that non-locality is more flexible than specialized attention methods, and that it adapts to different modalities.",
        " While the object of conventional learning is to estimate the value function, or the optimum policy, we show that a careful consideration of the bias function leads to an important reduction of the bounds on the regret. We prove that our method can be expected to achieve sub-linear regret on both episodic and infinite-horizon MDPs. Our method provides both a theoretical framework for the use of bias functions in the regret-minimization problem, and practical algorithms for implementation in real-world reinforcement-learning problems. Our main innovation is that the policy estimates both the value function and the bias function simultaneously through the use of a carefully designed exploration strategy. Empirical comparisons with other methods show that our method outperforms previous methods, especially in the presence of complex transition rules where the usual methods have difficulty in balancing exploration and exploitation.",
        " Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful new way to learn visual representations without human annotated data, achieving impressive performance on a variety of tasks. However, the underlying mechanism of successful learning in contrastive frameworks is still not well understood. In this paper, we investigate the underlying feature learning process in self-supervised contrastive learning and study how representations change during training. We show that self-supervised contrastive methods automatically learn the most salient natural invariances from the augmentations, which result in a consistent developmental trajectory of learning features. We provide a detailed characterization of this process by introducing a new decomposition that captures the learning process in a way that is interpretable. We identify critical phases in the training process and introduce metrics to evaluate the relative merits of different feature subsets.",
        " Introducing a Machine Learning Approach to Missile Autopista Design The paper presents a new approach to missile autopista design based on reinforcement learning, which overcomes the problem of nonlinearity and uncertain operating conditions. The new approach is based on a model of the system obtained by a reinforcement learning method, which is able to learn to adapt the system to changing operating conditions, aerodynamic uncertainty, and controllability constraints. The resulting control policy is compared with conventional gain-scheduled proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and H-infinity controllers, through high-fidelity simulations and Monte Carlo simulations. The obtained autopista is evaluated by comparison with conventional PID controllers and an H-infinity controller with aerodynamic uncertainty, and the results show that the resulting autopista is up to 35% more effective in tracking than the conventional PID controller. The paper presents an approach to obtaining a hybrid policy using a Markov Decision Process method and a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) search method, with the reward functions tailored to the system, including tracking performance, control effort, and robustness metrics. It demonstrates that reinforcement learning can be a viable design method for next-generation missile guidance and control systems.",
        " The previous sentence is also true. By way of contrast, the scene is drawn on a clean background. Is oblique. Experiments on the COCO and Cityscapes data, and on the medical images, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially on challenging scenes such as occlusion, scaling, and complex backgrounds. This is achieved by combining self-supervised learning with an attention mechanism that captures long-range dependencies between object parts. Our experiments also show the importance of using high-level information to guide the segmentation, especially for ambiguous cases where low-level features are not enough.",
        " XGAN is an unsupervised translation between images, which can deal with the many-to-many mapping between different images. XGAN is a two-stage network with a shared latent variable and a separate decoding part, which can simultaneously learn many cross-classifier transformations without needing a pair of training examples. It is based on the deep convolutional neural network, and its operation is easy to understand and can be achieved with the help of a lot of experimental data. The proposed method is more effective than previous methods in terms of translation between different classes and more flexible modeling of arbitrary complex domain relationships. The code and models used in the experiment are publicized to facilitate further study in this direction.",
        " The paper presents a novel clustering method which is able to enhance the segmentation accuracy and robustness of medical images. Earlier fuzzy clustering methods were not able to segment images because of their noisy nature and irregular intensity. This paper proposes a method of clustering based on a combination of fuzzy c-means and adaptive fuzzy neighborhood. This method can combine the intensity distribution and spatial coherence of the local images and produce a better definition of the anatomical structures. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms the earlier method of clustering in medical images such as MRI, CT and ultrasonography, and outperforms many other advanced clustering methods. The proposed method of clustering can also be used for medical image analysis, and is very helpful in diagnosis and treatment planning. It can be measured by Dice coefficients of 8-12%, Jaccard indices of 7-11% and boundary detection accuracy of 9-14%, and the improvement of robustness to noise of 8-11%.",
        " “We introduce a symmetry-aware actor-critic framework for the generation of 3D molecular structures. While traditional methods either operate in 2D space or fail to account for the inherent symmetry of 3D molecular conformations, our method explicitly incorporates symmetry constraints in both policy learning and structure generation. We develop a permutation-equivariant neural network architecture which respects the rotational, translational, and atom-identity symmetries of the molecular system, thus facilitating more efficient exploration of the chemical space. The performance of our framework is evaluated across a number of molecular design tasks, where it is found to generate more diverse, valid, and property-optimized molecules than state-of-the-art methods. Our actor-critic policy optimizes for both chemical validity and target properties, while the symmetry-aware component of the framework significantly reduces the search space by avoiding redundant molecular conformations. Using a sequence of artificial neural networks, we train a permutation-equivariant policy that constrains its structure generation policy to conform to the underlying molecular symmetry of the system. We demonstrate that this policy is able to discover molecules with properties that optimize a set of selected properties.",
        " The result is a comparison of two methods for the automatic segmentation of skin lesions, a necessary and essential preprocessing step for the dermatological diagnosis. We implemented and evaluated a classical convolutional neural network (CNN) and a more recent transformer-based model on publicly available dermoscopy image datasets ISIC-18 and PH2. Performance was measured by various metrics such as the Dice coefficient, the Jaccard coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity. Analyses of failed cases showed that both implementations failed at the borders with low contrast and heavily occluded lesions, but with different error patterns. While the transformer-based approach achieved the highest accuracy of 0.912, compared to 0.876 for the CNN, it required much more computing resources and training time. On the other hand, the CNN was more efficient and yielded comparable results for the less complex lesions. This comparison contributes to the development of more accurate and efficient tools for the automatic melanoma detection and classification. The results provide useful insights into the choice of the most appropriate methods for the given clinical needs, available computing resources, and lesion characteristics.",
        " They wanted to develop a new way of producing retinal images that would be capable of displaying the symptoms of various ophthalmic conditions, but they found a serious deficiency in the data set of pathological images from which to train the machine. This problem is addressed by using two generative models, the first of which, called StyleGAN, is trained to generate anatomically accurate retinal images from healthy retinal images, and the second, a symptom transformation network, which allows to detect the signs of the disease and to preserve the overall integrity of the retinal images. This system was evaluated both by clinical experts and by ophthalmologists. The results were measured by Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and structural similarity metrics, which showed that the generated images resemble real samples in pathological details, while maintaining clinical relevance. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on five common pathologies: diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal vein occlusion, and hypertensive retinopathy. This is a promising way to address the problem of lack of images in medicine and the development of systems for recognizing the signs of eye diseases. When added to the training data, our images improved the classification accuracy of the diagnostic models by a mean of 8.3 percent.",
        " This paper describes a new, rotation-invariant autoencoder architecture that is tailored for processing spherical signals. It builds on spherical harmonics within a deep learning architecture to learn latent representations that remain consistent under rotation. According to our extensive experiments on various spherical data, such as climate signals, cosmic background radiation, and 3D object models, the rotation-invariant autoencoder outperforms conventional autoencoders on the quality of the reconstructions, on the generalization to unknown orientations, and on downstream classification tasks. Our experiments on various spherical data sets, such as climate patterns, cosmic background radiation, and 3D object models, show that the rotation-invariant autoencoder is an efficient and principled approach to dimensionality reduction and feature extraction from spherical data.",
        " Our method for dealing with video denoising consists in a comprehensive implementation of the VBM3D algorithm. This approach generalizes the principles of denoising images to the temporal domain, by using both the spatial and temporal redundancy in the image. We give a detailed description of our implementation, which is very computationally efficient, while retaining a satisfactory denoising performance. Experimental results on several standard test sequences demonstrate that our implementation is comparable to or superior to other existing methods, both in terms of objective metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and in terms of subjective image quality. We also present a few novel variants of the original VBM3D approach, based on an adaptation of the temporal windows and on a motion compensated filtering procedure, which improves the results of the original method up to a maximum of 0.8 dB improvement in PSNR. In the spirit of open-source software, we release our implementation and all the documentation in order to encourage further work on video denoising.",
        " CHAPTER XXV—A STRICTLY AFTER-TRAINING APPROACH TO RUBLISHNESS IN DEEP LEARNING—DEEP LEARNING has shown remarkable results in various applications, but has also been exposed to the danger of variations in the distribution of input data and of adversarial attacks. In this paper we introduce KATANA, a simple but effective post-training approach to enhancing the model's robustness, which does not require retraining or re-architecture. KATANA is a simple but effective method to enhance the model's robustness. Through a large number of experiments on the image classification problem, we demonstrate that KATANA significantly increases the robustness against various input data corruptions, adversarial attacks, and changes in the distribution, and outperforms other specialized defensive mechanisms, while maintaining the accuracy of the original data. We show theoretically why the test-time augmentation of weights increases robustness and empirically analyze the effects of different augmentations. Our method is extremely light in weight, which makes it useful when there is no training data or there is no computation power to retrain. Besides, it is compatible with the existing architecture of the network, and thus is easy to apply.",
        " In this paper we introduce a new category-theoretic approach to manifold learning. We develop a functorial framework for dimensionality reduction that formalizes the relationship between high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional representations, and we formulate a general mathematical foundation for manifold learning in terms of the category of functors between suitable categories. We prove several theorems on the conditions under which these functors preserve the structural properties of the data manifold, and we present composition rules for combining manifold learning methods that preserve theoretical guarantees. We use this framework to formalize how various manifold learning methods, such as Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding, and t-SNE, can be understood as specific instantiations of functors that respect geometric or topological invariants. This work bridges the gap between the algebraic formalism of category theory and the geometric intuition of manifold learning, and opens up new avenues for the principled design of dimensionality reduction methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data show that our functorial perspective not only gives us theoretical insights, but also provides practical benefits in the design and evaluation of manifold learning methods.",
        " The ”Few Shots” problem in image recognition remains a formidable challenge, in that it requires the learning model to accurately separate objects that are completely novel to it, from extremely few samples. We introduce a novel method for tackling this problem: the Cycle-Consistent Transformer (CCT). This method combines transformers to extract a rich representation of the context of the image, and then applies the consistency constraint to ensure a robust correspondence of features between the two images. Through extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-i, the performance of our method is compared with the state of the art in the 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Moreover, when there are significant differences in the appearance of the support image and the corresponding unknown image, our method achieves remarkable performance. In addition, the experiment shows that the cycle-consistency constraint is effective in stabilizing the training and improving generalization to new classes. We intend to make the code and the pre-trained models available to the public, to facilitate further research in this direction.",
        " This paper presents a novel method of ice-rink localization in hockey videos. It uses two-stage analysis, in the first of which a convolutional neural network detects the potentially relevant areas of the field by means of color and texture analysis, while the second stage, geometric verification, corrects the region detections by comparing the line segments with a predefined ice-rink model. Localization of the Ice-field in Broadcast-hockey-videos This paper enables applications such as automatic player tracking, game statistics extraction, and augmented reality visualization without the need for manual ice-field calibration, thus greatly increasing the efficiency of hockey-television production and analysis. Experiments conducted on a large and diverse set of broadcast-hockey-videos show a localization accuracy of 94.7% at 28 frames per second. It is also robust to various broadcasting styles, camera angles, and lighting conditions.",
        " ‘A novel method for image segmentation, based on clustering, is proposed in this paper. Using the improved distance function, the proposed method, which combines the spatial information of the image with the intensities of its elements, enhances the preserving of boundaries and the noise resistance of image features.’ The efficiency of the method was proved by a comparison with standard clustering methods. It was observed that, for images of all sorts, including natural scenes, medical images and satellite images, the method gave better results. ‘The new method has proved useful in all areas where the need for precise image partitioning is paramount.’",
        " Position encoding schemes play a critical role in the Vision Transformer (ViT) by supplying spatial information lost during tokenization. We present a critical evaluation of the shortcomings of existing position encoding schemes, and propose a novel method for relative position encoding for the ViT. DRPE uses a lightweight attention-based encoding scheme, which does not require any fixed position embeddings. We demonstrate superior performance over existing schemes in image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks on a variety of ViT architectures. Our work sheds light on the critical role of position encoding in the ViT and provides a practical way to improve its representational power. DRPE is able to transfer its learned representations to new architectures, and is also robust to resolution changes.",
        " Approaching this second question by considering the last, we find that it is as follows. With THEODORE, we can make considerable advances in omni-vision, in surveillance, in robots, in intelligent environment, especially in case of a great lack of data. We also analyze the impact of different adaptation techniques to maximize knowledge transfer from synthetic to real domains. Moreover, we have discovered that the model THEODORE, although it yields a 27% improvement in mean average precision for object detection and an 18% improvement for semantic segmentation, is nevertheless, compared to that which is developed only in the real, a 17% increase in the mAP for object detection and a 15% increase in the mAP for semantic segmentation. It is with great pleasure that we make available the images and the trained models to the scientific community to encourage further research in this new field.",
        " We describe a new approach to the task of multi-person localization and tracking using the 360° field of view of a single camera, and to the reconstruction of positions in a single coordinate system. Our method uses a specialized coordinate transformation, which translates equirectangular images into a unified 3D panoramic space, in order to provide precise position estimation in the presence of distortions in the projections. The proposed method has great advantages for applications such as surveillance, monitoring, human behaviour analysis and behavior tracking where precise spatial knowledge is crucial. The detection system combines a deep learning architecture with a modification adapted to panoramic images with a tracking algorithm which maintains consistency across occlusions and different lighting conditions. The experiment, performed in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments, has shown an average accuracy of 87.3% in tracking and 91.6% in localization, which outperforms traditional multi-camera methods in complex environments and with greatly reduced computational complexity. The system runs in real time on standard platforms, enabling deployment in resource-limited environments.",
        " Opportunistic learning is a special case of the deep learning method. Hyperspectral image classification suffers from lack of labels, high dimensionality and the complexity of the spectral-spatial map. This paper presents a new method, a transfer network, which takes into account these limitations through a unified deep learning framework and which integrates the learning of spectral and spatial features with the methods of transfer learning. Various experiments on four data sets (Indian Pines, University of Pavia, Salinas, Houston) show that the proposed method achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods, with an average accuracy of 92.6%, a Kappa coefficient of 79.1% and a spectral dispersion of up to 63.6% in two classes, and a Kappa coefficient of up to 66% in the fourth. The transfer network is composed of three main elements: the first is a deep spectral-spatial extraction network which learns the dependencies between spectral bands and spatial points; the second is an active learning strategy which, by intelligently selecting the most representative samples, reduces the cost of annotation and maintains high accuracy; the third is a transfer learning mechanism which transfers the knowledge of a spectral class from the source to a target where the labeled samples are sparse. The framework of the paper, by combining deep spectral-spatial feature extraction with active and transfer learning, makes a significant contribution to the development of hyperspectral image classification.",
        " “A Universal Decoding Method for Biomedical Image Segmentation” by Ruijui Zhu et al. He et al. present a new decoding method for deciphering biomedical images. The cascade decoding method combines multi-scale feature fusion, attention-guided refinement and boundary-aware enhancement to efficiently extract both the global context and fine-grained details that are critical for accurate segmentation. The cascade decoding method was evaluated on multiple biomedical image modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, and microscopy images. It consistently performed better than state-of-the-art methods. The method is highly flexible and can be used with any encoder. The decoding accuracy of the cascade decoding method is significantly improved, especially for the small and poorly-defined boundary of the objects. Its speed remains comparable to the speed of its predecessors.",
        " A new approach to intelligent greenhouse control by means of model-based deep reinforcement learning is described. The traditional greenhouse control system is unable to simultaneously optimize all of the physical and biological conditions of the greenhouse, which are constantly changing. The new framework combines physical models of the greenhouse with deep learning methods to build a more efficient and reliable greenhouse control system. The system successfully achieves the simultaneous control of the temperature, humidity and resource use. Experiments with plants during several growing seasons show that the proposed method outperforms the purely rule-based control and standard deep reinforcement learning systems, achieving an increase in yield of 18% and a reduction in energy consumption of 23%. This paper extends the state-of-the-art in precision agriculture by providing a data-efficient, interpretable and data-light approach to self-driving greenhouse management, which can be applied to different crops and climates. The embedded model component improves the training efficiency and generalization ability of the system.",
        " Safety during exploration by analogical reasoning. We present a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework for MDPs which enables exploration of unknown environments safely by reasoning by analogy with similar situations encountered in the past. Provably Safe Analogy-PAC-based exploration of MDPs. The key innovation is the formulation of a safety-based analogy-based inference procedure, which allows the agent to generalize about safety knowledge across different states with similar dynamics. Empirical evaluations across various safety-critical domains show that our approach can substantially reduce the likelihood of visiting an unsafe state compared to existing safe RL methods while maintaining a rate of learning which is near-optimal. We prove that our method can achieve PAC-MDP efficiency while keeping the probability of visiting an unsafe state below a specified threshold. The overall approach reconciles the two demands of efficient exploration and safety guarantees in RL. This opens the way to the principled use of RL agents in safety-critical real-world applications.",

        " This is a survey of the open-source Kornia, a differentiable vision library based on PyTorch. We investigate how Kornia can span the gap between the traditional methods of vision and deep learning by providing differentiated versions of classical vision functions. We also demonstrate that the Kornia library is able to combine classical vision functions into deep neural network structures, while propagating the gradients through the entire computational graph. We analyze the Kornia's technical architecture, pointing out the basic design principles that emphasize hardware acceleration, batch operations, and automatic differentiation. We show how Kornia can be used in various application areas and illustrate its superiority with various examples, including the estimation of the homography, the registration of images, and the creation of new views. Then we outline the current limitations and the development prospects of the Kornia library, which has already been adopted by many research and industrial groups.",
        " The article is devoted to a method of representation learning by the method of gradients. As mutual information has been found to be a powerful objective in the learning of a reliable representation, the method of direct optimization has been found difficult by reason of the difficulty of estimating mutual information in high-dimensional spaces. The estimation of the gradients of mutual information has proved an efficient means of learning representations, and has enabled the invention of such a system as the method here proposed. The theoretical analysis of this method demonstrates that it can produce gradients of mutual information with less variance than previous methods while being efficient in computation. The experimental comparison of the method on various examples has shown that the method’s learning of representations outperforms that by contrastive methods and by variational methods. This result establishes the estimation of gradients of mutual information as a foundation for representation learning that can combine both theoretical accuracy and practical performance. We also demonstrate that our method is more resistant to the choice of the architecture and the setting of hyper-parameters.",
        " This paper presents a new proving method for the exploitation of the strategic interaction between agents, to overcome the difficulties of MARC, when multiple agents are learning simultaneously. We present a new proving method: we call it “Exploiter”. We have theoretically derived the proving method for the exploitation of the strategic interplay between the agents, which has a sample complexity which is not greater than the relevant problem-parameters, and is agnostic to the specific approximation method used. Our proving method significantly outperforms other methods, especially in environments with large state spaces, in which traditional MARL algorithms fail. We have applied it to many different types of multi-agent problems. We show that the Exploiter proving method is capable of learning the proving problems with polynomial complexity, without being bound to any particular function approximation. The results obtained are promising in that the gap between theoretical results and practical performance in multi-agent reinforcement learning has been closed.",
        " Over time, the growing complexity of deep learning models and their dependence on large memory and computation resources has created an urgent need to optimize the execution of these models on resource-constrained devices. We introduce a new approach to neural network compression by means of sparseness techniques. And our experiments on various network architectures show a compression ratio of up to 10-15  and only a small ( 1  ) decrease in accuracy. This compression method is based on a hierarchical search of sparse dictionaries across layers, in which we seek to remove redundant features, and the structure is preserved by iteratively removing less important links while maintaining accuracy. This paper also provides a theoretical guarantee on the convergence properties of the sparseness optimization. Notably, our method outperforms existing pruning methods and quantization techniques, especially for edge devices.",
        " The shadows often confuse the photogrammetric reconstruction, and often lead to an error in the model. Our method, which we call Shadow Neural Radiance Fields (Shadow-NeRF), is an extended neural framework that can handle the different variations of light intensity on satellite images. They use a shadow model that considers both the direction of the sun and the occlusion between the different objects in the image. The experiments, on different satellite image datasets, show that this method can achieve superior results to that of both the usual photogrammetric method and the normal NeRF method. The geometrical error in the shadow areas is reduced by 37%. We thus present a method that can be used for 3D reconstruction from satellite images, with applications in urban planning, natural disasters, and other applications. The method also allows us to remove shadows from the model, relight the model in different light conditions, and improve the change detection.",
        " Newton's Method, and others, calculating with the speed of light, have been established in mathematics as well as in mechanics. But as the systems were built to have the very different and difficult dimensions, the curves must have had to be distinguished in order to facilitate the distinguishing of one from the other. Moreover, Newton's method was called upon to make a calculation of this kind. Then a single fixed point was put in the coordinates of the center, of the distances from the center, and of the centers, and so on. We derive efficient methods for posterior inference, hyperparameter optimization, and prediction in the transformed space. We empirically demonstrate significant improvements over Gaussian processes and competing non-Gaussian processes, especially for data exhibiting complex distributional characteristics. The proposed methodology bridges the gap between the well-established theoretical foundations of Gaussian processes and the representational power of normalizing flows, opening new avenues for probabilistic modeling in various application areas, such as time series analysis, spatial statistics, and Bayesian optimization.",
        " Using graph neural networks, we show how to learn molecular representations from unlabeled data, using a technique called contrastive learning, without the need for labeled examples. MolCLR: Molecular Contrastive Learning of Representations via Graph Neural Networks More specifically, we first assemble the molecules into pairs by exchanging atoms and non-atom parts, then augment the pairs with a distance measure, so as to ensure that they are distinct, and then we run them through a graph encoder with a contrastive objective, which aims to optimize the agreement between the two representations of the same molecule, while separating those of different molecules. We then show through extensive experiments on benchmarks that this process of enhancing the representations has a major effect on performance on downstream tasks, including prediction of molecular properties, estimation of the affinity between a drug and its target, and prediction of a reaction. MolCLR provides a powerful general framework for making use of the huge amount of unlabeled molecular data that is available, to further drug discovery and materials science applications.",
        " This paper presents a novel approach for generating new views of a scene from a six degrees of freedom camera pose without any additional scene description or multiple input images. The first stage generates a coarse geometric model from the six degrees of freedom, and the second stage generates a high-quality image through a conditional generative process. The new view is reconstructed through two stages. This method outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. It also runs in real time on a personal computer, which makes it suitable for real-time applications in virtual reality, augmented reality, and information visualization. Our method is a significant step toward the synthesis of new views of the world from a minimum input.",
        " This paper develops a framework for the analysis of paths which move on Lie groups. Using the algebraic properties of the Lie group and its associated Lie algebra, we find a natural definition of the signature that is compatible with the group’s geometry and topology. It is shown that parallel transport along paths provides a geometric interpretation of our construction. The uniqueness of paths with bounded variation to tree-like equivalence is proved. Various applications to random walks on Lie groups, to non-Euclidean pattern recognition, and to geometric control theory are also investigated. We conclude with some unexplored examples. The results provide a strong mathematical framework for the analysis of paths which naturally occur on group actions. The new theory will have far-reaching consequences for the study of sequential data, with applications in many areas of science and technology, from biology to mathematical finance.",
        " Transfer learning has become a dominant method for improving the performance of natural language processing systems. However, there is little information about the security implications of transfer learning for text classification. In this paper, we explore the misclassification attacks against transfer-learned text classifiers. Experiments on different text classification tasks show that transfer-learned classifiers are more susceptible to adversarial examples than classifiers trained from scratch. Compared to the transfer-learned classifiers, the attack success rate increases by up to 42 percent. We design and implement a new misclassification attack framework, which targets the transition of the inherited knowledge and the fine-tuning. We also investigate various defensive strategies. We show that the retraining method, which is designed for the transition, is the most effective defense.",
        " This paper proposes a new deep architecture, Sequence Transformer Neural Network (STN), for clinical time series that exploits the invariances inherent in clinical time series. Using self-attention mechanisms, it allows to capture the long-range dependencies, and a series of specialized components for handling missing values, duration and features, it provides a way to achieve invariance in clinical time series. The experimental results on the MIMIC III and eICU data sets have been conducted, compared with existing methods, showing that the performance of STN is better than that of the current state-of-the-art methods in the three aspects of mortality, duration estimation and phenotyping, the improvement of AUROC is 7.2%, and the model can still achieve stable performance even when the missing rate is high (up to 70%). This paper argues that STN can learn meaningful representations, and invariant patterns across patients, regardless of the differences in the time of measurement and the frequency of observations. These results show that explicitly modelling invariances in clinical time series can improve the prediction performance, and the model also reveals clinically meaningful insights into how the model can distinctly learn the time-series representation of each patient and identify the temporal pattern of the disease.",
        " localized mask based image-to-image translation. Image-to-image translation has been remarkable in recent years, and yet the main tools for this task are deep generative networks that operate on the whole image. We introduce a framework for image-to-image translation that addresses both “what” and “where” translation, and aims to identify regions where the translation must be applied while preserving the original content elsewhere. Our experiments on face attributes, object transfiguration and object style transfer show that our method is more natural because it keeps the fidelity of the content in the untreated areas and modifies the semantically relevant regions precisely. We propose a two-step network architecture with a mask generation stage and a translation stage, which learns to localize the translation-related regions. Extensive experiments in these three domains show that our method outperforms other localized translation approaches for content preservation, translation quality and computation time. The localized translation of the generative network can be flexibly applied to many image-editing applications.",
        " This paper extends the framework of submodular optimization from sets to multisets. While submodular functions operate on the idea of set-inclusion, the notion of item importance is generalized to set-component. We introduce a novel class of probabilistic models, the Integer Submodular Models, and present a theoretically sound variational framework for ISMs, with a proof of the first accurate approximation guarantees. Our method is demonstrated on diverse problems, including summarization of text documents with repetition constraints, the summarization of image collections with duplicates, and the sampling of samples from ecological populations, showing that the multiset approach significantly outperforms the traditional set-based methods, especially in cases where the multiset structure is a source of information. The implementation of our method is based on a special class of truncated log-concave distributions, which provide efficient approximation with low error rate, while guaranteeing high accuracy in a perturbed sense. Our method bridges the gap between discrete submodular optimization and practical applications in which counts and repetitions are important.",
        " Some indifference to an analogy of the undergrowth. As it is no longer rare for people to seek out in the wilderness a similarity, so this paper proposes a new framework for the visual presentation of similarity models. The framework, by means of a combination of dimension-reducing methods, attribution methods and an interaction of various visual devices, enables the analysis of the behavior of similarity models, on different types of data, including text, images and structured data. The experimental evaluation, conducted on three domains, demonstrates that our visual explanations improve the trust of users, enable more effective model debugging, and encourage more appropriate deployment decisions of similarity-based systems. This paper fills a critical gap in the explainability of AI literature.",
        " Deep learning has proven to be a powerful tool for recognizing images, but their lack of transparency inhibits their adoption in many applications where there is a need for clear explanations of classification. In contrast, prototype-based models have emerged as promising interpretable alternatives, allowing classifications to be explained by explaining their similarity to the learned prototypes. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for enhancing prototype-based models with explicit reasoning capabilities, allowing them to not only detect similarity (“this looks like this”), but also explain why they are similar (“because...”). Our framework integrates visual feature extraction and prototype learning, building a semantic bridge between low-level visual features and high-level prototypes. Our framework is an important step towards more interpretable systems that can communicate their reasoning to humans in human-understandable terms. Through extensive experiments on standard datasets, we show that our method achieves good classification performance while significantly improving explanation quality. Furthermore, through subjective evaluations, we show that enhanced explanations lead to better mental models of the system’s decision-making process, leading to improved human-machine collaboration.",
        " There is a simple theorem which enables the polynomial network to approximate more functions than its other forms, and with less effort. It is a better than the one that is in general used, because it is more powerful and has less errors. Its peculiarities are that it is more easily analysed, and more powerful in computing the values of the unknown quantities; and it has the advantage of being more interpretable. Moreover, its construction makes it possible to overcome the difficulties of the higher-order operations, in the computation of the gradients, and the representation of the features. We have been able to show by experiment on the most important data, CIFAR-1, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, that they are as good as the more recent models, while being more robust to attacks and deviations of the data. There is much to be said for them, for applications where the performance and the resistance of the data are essential.",

The reader is directed to the abstract, where it is stated that the same is to be able to compress or decompress the light, and to produce all kinds of combinations of optical and mechanical operations. According to numerical simulations and experimental verification, it is demonstrated that the same can be trained to perform various operations in the optical domain, such as the classification of objects, the recognition of their features, and their isolation. Compared to a conventional multi-pixel system, the use of a single photodetector is necessary for this device, thereby reducing the hardware and its cost and complexity. This study spans the gap between computational imaging and optical machine learning, opening up new possibilities for the development of intelligence in resource-limited environments. In addition, the results obtained in the study point to the possibility of diffractive networks as a promising platform for edge computing, in such cases where resource limitations prohibit the use of conventional vision systems.",
        " Embedding-based retrieval systems have become essential to large-scale information retrieval. This paper is a comprehensive investigation of pre-training tasks designed to enhance the performance of such retrieval systems over a range of domains. A new framework is proposed to classify and evaluate pre-training objectives. It consists of three parts. The first of these consists of objectives that directly relate to the question answering task. These tasks train models to learn more stable representations of the query and the responses. In our experiments, our best pre-training strategy improves recall at the level of 0.95 and MRR at the level of 0.92 over strong fine-tuning systems. The second category of pre-training objectives involves using features extracted from documents during the question answering process to pre-train models to learn better representations of the responses. The third category of pre-training objective involves using features extracted from the responses to improve the accuracy of question answering.",
        " DYNAMIC GRAPH NEUTRAL NETWORKS.—While Graph Neural Net-works have shown remarkable success in the study of stationary systems, they have not been as successful in dynamic structures, where nodes, edges, and features may vary with time. The present paper presents a self-supervised method, developed for the study of dynamic graphs, which uses the pattern of evolution and changes in structural properties to learn generalized representations. An extensive evaluation of our method on six real-world data sets from diverse application domains demonstrates that pretraining our method leads to a significant improvement in later performance on tasks such as dynamic link prediction, temporal node classification, and prediction of events on the graph level. Pretrained networks outperform state-of-the-art methods on average by 8 percent and require substantially less task-related data. Our work lays the foundation for more efficient and effective learning of dynamic graphs with limited supervision. We also provide insights into the transferability of learned representations across time scales and graph distributions.",
        " The paper deals with a new method of detecting anomalies by means of a regularized cyclic-consistent generative adversarial network (RC-GAN). In order to overcome the inherent imbalance in the data, and to better model complex normal patterns, we have combined the proposed cyclic-consistent regularization with various weighting schemes. We introduce a multi-term loss function which combines a recombinant GAN-based reconstruction and a multi-term regularization. Extensive experiments on a number of datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR and industrial datasets, have shown that the proposed method has a better detection accuracy and lower false positive rate. The model is trained only on normal samples, and can therefore only reconstruct normal data with high fidelity, and cannot reproduce the reconstruction of the samples from the set of abnormal samples. The results of omission tests prove the importance of each of the proposed regularizations, and show that the proposed method is a robust and flexible tool that can detect subtle anomalies.",
        " Unlike other systems, which use several types of sensors or special apparatuses, our method employs only the optical signal from the ordinary dashboard camera, to make a real-time evaluation of the distance of the obstacles, and predict the time to collision (TTC). We first present a two-stage deep architecture which first performs efficient object detection and then predicts the path of the moving objects by means of a recurrent neural network, which makes use of both spatial and temporal features. The latter network, with its two-stage architecture, does not require any special apparatuses, and thus offers a high possibility of its integration in existing vehicles without the need for special apparatuses, or the necessity of using special sensors. The proposed method, based on an ordinary camera, performs collision risk assessment with an average accuracy of 89.3%, and a processing speed of 27 images per second on standard apparatus. Extensive evaluation on the BDD100K and CRD90 data sets, shows a 17.2% increase in performance over the conventional methods, while giving comparable performance to the more hardware-intensive LIDAR-based systems.",
        " — It is the medium-level, medium-scale, intermediate representation of traffic scenes, between low-level raster and high-level semantics. It is a collection of stixels, horizontally-arranged, discrete segments. Each stixel contains height, distance and semantic information, giving a compact but complete picture of the traffic environment. The stixel world works well for detecting obstacles and for measuring the free space. The stixel world supports further processing, such as object tracking and path planning. The approach combines data from stereo vision and semantic segmentation to form a thin volumetric representation of the scene, separating out the road from the free space, obstacles and free space. It has been tested successfully on challenging urban datasets. The stixel world offers a solid basis for robust perception in complex traffic scenes. The number of stixels is limited to a few thousand. That makes it possible to handle the scenes in real time on the embedded hardware platforms used in cars.",
        " The use of Probabilistic Reward Machines in the learning of an artificial intelligence, by Ned Debye and Peter Debray, in their work cited in the bibliography under reference number 149 is, as will be seen, a remarkable instance of the integration of previous work with that of the immediate subject. Moreover, as it is possible to infer from the first actions the correctness of their later ones, we might conclude that, if we applied the lessons of the last two chapters to our yearly series, the relations of reward and loss, on the part of the learners, were to be confined to a strict and exact determination of a simple value of the external State. Debye and Debray have based their method on a complex spectral learning procedure that allows them to rapidly identify the hidden reward structure of a given task. Experiments have been carried out on various real-world problems, showing that agents which learn the P-RM from the data perform much better than those that are given only a single reward value. Moreover, their method has been proved to converge to the true P-RM in the limit of sufficient data, and has been combined with existing reinforcement learning methods. In this way, a powerful tool is made available for the solution of sequential decision-making problems with complex reward structures.",
        " Diff-Td Learning Unlike standard td learning that concentrates on estimating the difference in values, Dtd learning learns to exploit the differential rate of change in state features to improve the learning performance and accelerate convergence. Dtd learning enables the automatic assignment of credit and thereby reduces the approximation error. We show in detail the mathematical theory behind Dtd learning, and show that Dtd learning can be adapted to work with gradient-based optimization. We empirically evaluate Dtd learning on continuous and discrete tasks and show that Dtd learning outperforms the standard td learning method in the tasks with complex transition behavior and sparse rewards. The improved learning performance and the lower asymptotic error rates provide promising prospects for further research on reinforcement learning in dynamic environments.",
        " Graph-based representation learning has been used successfully in many areas, such as social networks and molecular structures. Despite the advances in model architectures and performance evaluation, two fundamental problems remain: interpretation and evaluation. This paper analyzes these problems and proposes solutions. Interpretation is a critical problem. First, we identify the factors that inhibit the interpretability of graph neural networks. Then, the evaluation is critically reviewed. The evaluation is based on a combination of structural fidelity, semantic accuracy, and generalization capability. Finally, we theoretically connect interpretability and evaluation, proving that an improvement in one can help the other. The results of the experiments on a variety of graph datasets show that a model with similar scores can have a large difference in the quality of the model under our evaluation metrics.",
        " Anomaly Detection by Transfer Learning in Agricultural and Industrial IoT System This paper proposes a transfer learning method to enhance anomaly detection in agricultural and industrial IoT systems. In agricultural and industrial IoT systems, accurate detection of anomalies is a fundamental task for ensuring the efficiency of the operation, the quality of the product and the security of the system. On the other hand, in the large-scale IoT environment, the amount of data is very scarce. A new transfer learning method is proposed to transfer deep learning models trained in data-rich environments to resource-limited IoT systems. The method is compared with the existing methods, and the accuracy of anomaly detection is improved by 17-23%, and the amount of training data is reduced by more than 65%. In addition, the method is very resistant to drift and adaptation, and is suitable for the IoT environment. It is also proved that the model can be used under the condition of resource scarcity.",
        " ‘This paper addresses fundamental limitations in the expressiveness of GNNs, including the inability to distinguish certain graph structures or to capture long-distance dependencies. We propose a novel framework that enhances GNN expressiveness with three key innovations: a higher-order message-passing scheme that includes features outside the node’s immediate neighborhood, a structure-encoding mechanism that embeds graph structure in the node’s own representation, and an attention-guided aggregation function that dynamically weights structural features according to their relevance. The resulting method is both theoretically and practically superior to existing methods, as it achieves a discriminant power close to that of the Weisfeiler–Lehman graph isomorphism test. We perform extensive empirical evaluations on three representative data sets in the context of molecular modelling, social network analysis, and the analysis of protein interaction networks, demonstrating that our method can outperform existing methods.",
        " For learning of spatial transformations in several domains, a deep learning approach has proved useful, but how to ensure that these transformations are regular (bijective and smooth) is still a major challenge. We present ICON, a new framework for learning regular maps between geometric domains by enforcing inverse consistency during training. We show that ICON can learn regular maps while maintaining the accuracy of existing methods. It is able to prevent folding and incoherence even in difficult deformations and with sparse training data. ICON is a model of the forward-inverse pair of maps, the inverse of which is the penalty of the deviation from the identity. ICON provides a principled approach to learning regular transformations, which can be incorporated into various network architectures and applied to various domains. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees for the regularity of the learned maps under certain conditions.",
        " The book of the state-entity of a high-dimensional and a single-pointed path, taken by a hypothetical creature to a geometrical body, is a sufficient condition for the maintenance of an individuality, while the discovery of its more or less essential properties is a problem which involves mathematics. We make use of tools of differential geometry and information theory, and conceive of the problem as a problem of localizing the contents of the state-entity by a transformation which preserves the principal elements of structure, while reducing the dimensions of the problem. In the shortest paths the conservation of the principal elements of structure is no longer admitted; as well as the study of the weights of the state-entity is rendered possible. We prove that transformations which minimize the information loss with respect to these metrics preserve the landscape of the value-function, up to isomorphism. Our method has been tested in various domains, and it has been verified that these geometrically-motivated representations significantly improve the efficiency of training and the efficiency of transfer, with respect to the state-entity. This geometric approach offers both theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for designing representation learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. We also establish theoretical connections between our framework and existing representation learning methods, giving a unified view of why certain representations allow a more effective learning.",
        " This paper presents a framework for training deep neural networks efficiently, from initial architecture design to advanced optimization techniques. We point out and address common problems that inhibit model performance, such as gradient vanishing/exploding, overfitting, and unsatisfactory generalization. Through systematic experiments across several domains (such as vision, natural language, and reinforcement learning), we show how proper initialization strategies, normalization techniques, and learning-rate policies can greatly improve convergence and final model accuracy. Furthermore, we present novel techniques that expand beyond standard training procedures, such as knowledge distillation, adversarial training, and self-supervised learning, and show how they can be integrated into a unified framework. Finally, we propose a novel method of regulating regularization, based on model size and input characteristics, that can lead to an average performance increase of a full 12.3% compared to conventional methods.",
        " A second important problem is that of the compromising of data-related privacy in multi-party learning. We show that even with strong traditional privacy-enhancing techniques, one may be able to recover significant information about the private data. Our findings highlight the need for a more complete approach to privacy in multi-party learning, which covers not only the confidentiality of individual observations, but also the confidentiality of the statistics of the private data. We develop a framework for measuring the extent to which the statistical properties of the data leak out, and introduce improved privacy-enhancing techniques which reduce the leakage significantly without compromising the utility of the model.",
        " Unsupervised Learning of Sequences by Autoencoders This paper presents a novel method for learning the structural features of sequences. It is based on a recurrent neural network, and we compress the sequences using a specialized encoder-decoder structure. Unsupervisedly, we analyze the structure of the resulting latent spaces and show that sequences cluster by their semantic similarity, indicating that our method captures important semantic structure. Using extensive experiments on different data sets, we show that our method preserves the semantic structure of the sequences, even when the sequences are not concatenated in any way. Moreover, the learned representations have superior performance on downstream tasks such as clustering, classification, and anomaly detection, out-competing previous methods. Our method is suitable for a wide range of sequence-based applications, where annotated data is sparse or not available.",
        " Thus, the night fell; darkness, silence and nothingness. In the morning, a light shone from the east, And brightly shone the star of the morning. The world had awoken; a great day was dawning. This research not only significantly advances the state-of-the-art in the research on cross-modal representation learning, but also reveals how to effectively leverage the large-scale multi-media data of the web for general-purpose vision-language models. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that ImageBERT significantly outperforms existing methods on vision-language tasks, including visual question answering, image-text retrieval and image captioning.",
        " HELPING FROST TO FLY The Winds Were Breezing Off the Lichen The Self-Supervised Learning with Swin-Transformers Self-supervised learning is a novel type of unsupervised learning, where supervised learning is disregarded and it is instead an unsupervised learning that can work without labeled examples. While the supervised learning of the Vision transformers has been demonstrated to produce striking results, their hierarchical variants, the Swin-Transformers, have been found to offer advantages of speed of computation and other advantages. It is shown that the hierarchical construction of the Swin-Transformers, with their more efficient self-supervised learning, is able to save computational resources while producing competitive results. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing self-supervised methods, with superior performance on the supervised tasks of image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. The experiments also show that a combination of shifted window-based attention and self-supervised learning produces a powerful combination for learning visual representations from unlabeled data.",
        " ‘Reinforcement learning (RL) agents have a significant vulnerability to adversarial perturbations of their observation space. This introduces a new method, Policy Smoothing, to enhance the robustness of RL policies against adversarial attacks, while maintaining performance in non-adversarial settings. Through extensive experiments with continuous control RL problems, we demonstrate that Policy Smoothing consistently outperforms existing methods, leading to improved performance of up to 45% under strong adversarial attacks, with negligible performance degradation in non-adversarial settings. In addition, we show that Policy Smoothing is compatible with several existing RL methods, and can be implemented with little additional computational cost. Finally, we provide a formal guarantee on the robustness of policies learnt with our approach, establishing bounds on performance degradation under worst-case attacks in a defined norm-ball region.’ To summarize:",
        " Unconstrained Depth Estimation from Unconstrained Monocular Video by Learning Non-rigid Camera Motion Unlike previous methods which assume rigid scene deformation or that camera motion is known, our method learns to decompose the scene into regions and learns to predict both depth and deformation parameters of each region. It is shown through extensive experiments on the KITTI, Cityscapes, and our own UMV (Unconstrained Monocular Videos) datasets that our method significantly outperforms previous unsupervised methods, with up to a 15% reduction in absolute relative error, while also outclassing previous methods on regions of the scene where previous methods have failed. The geometric consistency of the region-level depth map can be improved by a geometric consistency loss which is region-sensitive. In addition, RDN has the ability to produce consistent depth maps from even highly dynamic scenes. As a result, the proposed method represents a significant step towards robust depth estimation from unconstrained videos without the need for expensive ground truth data.",
        " This is Realformer. The insertion of residual attention into the attention mechanism itself is new to the transformer architecture. Unlike standard transformers, which have residual connections around their attention blocks, our method creates residual paths inside the attention mechanism, which allows attention to be added up across layers. Especially deep architectures, the gradient decreases as the model grows deeper, and our study of the effect of residual attention shows that residual attention is particularly effective for deep models. We show in extensive experiments that the performance of Realformer is better than that of standard transformers in the general test, and that it is also more efficient. We then performed extensive experiments on the machine translation, language modeling and text classification tasks to show that Realformer has a much more effective gradient, more stable training and higher performance. Our results show that rethinking the placement of residual connections in attention-based architectures can greatly improve the performance of the model. The proposed method requires only a small change to the existing transformer implementation, and it can be used as a drop-in replacement in most cases.",
        " An object in this scene which is distant from the object that is closer to it. By means of a graph of regions, encoding the spatial relationships between these regions, a hierarchical system is obtained. This system makes it possible to establish a good logical organization for a given space; the regions, in fact, are the nodes of the graph, and the structure of the network gives rise to a series of nodes whose connection is represented by the lengths of the edges of the graph. This representation enables the detection of objects, even in complex scenes with partial occlusions, and this representation allows reliable, if necessary, multi-object tracking. On the other hand, this representation does not make it possible to identify in a very precise way the distribution of objects on a plan, it is impossible to make any statements about the depths of the bodies, and it is very difficult to draw an exact correspondence between the centers of the two successive zones of an image. However, as the object is in a naive way with respect to the plane, the aspect which it presents to us has, in spite of all its incompleteness, a simplicity which would prevent the creation of a path for the future. We are at the same time, as in the previous papers, trying to introduce an abstract but novel vision model of scenes with several objects.",
        " Using Filter Correlations for Deep Model Compression: Filter correlations allow to identify redundant filters of convolutional layers by an analysis framework that captures both inter- and intra-layer dependencies. Experimental results show that this framework outperforms standard methods like pruning and quantization, especially for models with a high filter redundancy. We also analyze the trade-off between accuracy and compression and propose an adaptive compression strategy to tune the compression rate for different network components. Representing highly correlated filters by a small set of basis filters and corresponding coefficient matrices, we achieve a compression ratio of three to ten times with very little accuracy degradation on ImageNet, CIFAR-100 and Multi-Scale-Coco. Compressed models significantly reduce inference time and memory consumption on both servers and mobile devices, making them particularly suited for resource-constrained environments.",
        " GNNs have been shown to be effective tools for analyzing graph-structured data in a variety of fields. However, the modeling power of traditional GNNs is limited by the inability to distinguish certain graph structures and a lack of the ability to model long-range connections. This paper proposes a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by enhancing GNNs with structural encodings and higher-order interactions. In addition, through a thorough theoretical analysis, we prove that our method has a strictly greater level of accuracy than the Weisfeiler–Lehman (W–L) criterion, thus overcoming the notorious “W–L” barrier. Extensive experiments across a wide variety of applications, including molecular property prediction, social network analysis, and knowledge graph completion, demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing GNNs. Our work presents a new approach to graph representation learning that substantially overcomes the limitations of GNNs. Our method not only achieves greater accuracy, but it also generalizes better to large, complex graphs.",
        " An interesting unsupervised learning scheme was proposed that combines the dimensionality reduction method with a mirror neural network. The neural network with mirror property is constructed with two interconnected neural networks, called the encoder and the decoder, arranged in a mirror-image fashion to preserve the intrinsic relationships in the data. This paper is devoted to a system of automatic clustering of data by means of a self-organizing map. When it comes to MNIST, fashion-MNIST, and real-world data, the proposed neural network with mirror property outperforms conventional unsupervised learning methods, such as k-means clustering and standard autoencoders, in classification accuracy over a wide range of data, averaging 87.3%, and its clustering in the reduced space is more logically organized. In addition, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of pattern recognition by providing a very useful method for automatic classification in situations where labelled data is scarce or even not available.",
        " This is a novel, deep recurrent model for EEG-based emotion recognition. EEG-based emotion recognition has the potential to be useful for a range of human-machine interaction and mental health applications. However, the dearth of labeled EEG data poses a serious challenge. We address this challenge by developing a semi-supervised deep learning method that can effectively combine labeled and unlabeled data to learn accurate emotion representations. The proposed method trains in two stages, first with large, unlabeled data, and then with limited, labeled data, achieving a significant improvement over the performance of fully supervised methods. In extensive experiments on the DEAP and SEED emotion datasets, we show that our method outperforms fully supervised methods, achieving an accuracy of 91% with only 30% of the labeled data. Our method employs a deep, recurrent architecture that takes advantage of the temporal dynamics in EEG to capture the information encoded in the brainwaves. Our results show the promise of semi-supervised deep learning for the practical application of affective computing using neurophysiological signals. Our model also exhibits improved generalization across subjects and sessions, overcoming the key challenge of variability in the brains of different individuals.",
        " The sub-space problem often becomes a problem because of the large numbers of atoms in the set of data. This paper proposes a method of sub-space discovery by the development of a Block-Diagonal Adaptive Locality-Constrained Representation (BALR) framework. We formulate the optimization problem with a carefully designed regularization term that will preserve the block-diagonal structure and promote the speed of the process. Extensive experiments on standard datasets such as the Extended Yale B, the Hopkins 155, and the COIL20 data show that this method can outperform the existing method in the case of noise and distortion. The key innovation is that the locality constraints can be automatically adapted to the intrinsic characteristics of the data, and can thus overcome the difficulties of unbalanced and mismatched data. The BALR framework has great potential for application in image segmentation, motion segmentation and other applications that require robust sub-space discovery. In addition, we theoretically show the convergence of the iterative search algorithm.",
        " This paper proposes a non-convex formulation of multiview learning that reduces the complexity of the optimization while maintaining the performance of the convex formulation. It is important to note that the convex formulation of multi-view learning has been used in the past to ensure consistency, convergence, and stability; but this is also the source of complexity and scalability problems in large-scale and high-dimensional data. Non-convex methods strategically relax the constraints on convexity and enable more efficient parameter learning and feature selection. The results of this paper show that the speed of the method is up to 65%, the memory usage is reduced by 48%, and the accuracy is comparable or higher than the current convex method. Non-convexity can also achieve practical benefits for multi-view learning in a limited resource and large-scale environment.",
        " This paper presents RMOPP, a multi-objective post-processing framework, which overcomes the limitations of deep learning object detection systems in terms of false positives, overlapping objects and their performance degradation when subjected to the variability of the environment. This paper presents a multi-objective object detection framework. RMOPP consists of an effective ensemble of post-processing techniques such as an adaptive suppression strategy, a context-aware filtering strategy and a novel confidence calibration strategy to adjust the detected scores based on the past performance. In extensive experiments on the COCO, Pascal and BDD100K data sets, RMOPP was shown to significantly increase the mean average precision (mAP) on several architectures, while the false positives rate was reduced by up to 42%. This work is agnostic to the object detection method and can be easily integrated into existing object detection pipelines. In addition, RMOPP introduces only a small computational overhead, making it suitable for real-time applications.",
        " Fake accounts in social media sites pose serious threats to the platform integrity, the users' trust, and the trustworthiness of information. This paper presents a new hybrid method to detect fake accounts in SNSs by combining NLP and metrical methods. Our framework is able to analyze the textual content of the users and their interaction patterns with other users. The combination of these two complementary approaches results in a more accurate detection than single-feature methods. The textual features of the users are extracted by using advanced NLP models, which helps us identify abnormal patterns of communication between the users. At the same time, the structure and the dynamics of the social network of the users are captured by using metrical methods. Our framework can be used to identify sophisticated fake accounts that escape detection by other methods. Our experiments on data from several large-scale social media platforms show that our hybrid method has an accuracy of 93.7 %, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.",
        " V2W-BERT is a method for classifying software vulnerabilities with a hierarchical structure, using a natural language processing technique based on transformers. This approach combines the text vectorization of the description of the vulnerability with a BERT architecture to address the inherent complexity of categorizing these categories in the CWE taxonomy. The method, in a comprehensive dataset of 103,852 real-world vulnerability data, is able to reach an accuracy of 87.3% for the first-level classification and 82.6% for the classification of the last level, and thus outperforms the traditional machine learning method by 9.2% and the deep learning methods by 6.5%.. The framework also has a high classification accuracy for zero-day vulnerabilities, thus providing a security consultant with a tool for the fast assessment and prioritization of these. This work contributes to the automation of security analysis by providing a semantic mapping between the text of the vulnerability and its classification.",
        " What this paper describes is a new depth sensing method which exploits physical color cues and a specialized aberration-correcting neural network. We take advantage of the optical aberrations inherent in most optical systems by selectively increasing the level of chromatic aberration, and using the de-aberration neural network (DeabNet) to correct for and to extract from the color coded depth cues. Across a range of challenging scenes and lighting conditions, our method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation accuracy, with an 18% reduction in absolute error compared to other single-image depth estimation methods. It retains robustness under challenging conditions, such as flat, textureless scenes, and rapidly changing light. Unlike other depth sensing methods, which depend on expensive hardware and computation, our approach only requires a single camera, with only a modest hardware modification. Our approach will thus greatly increase the accessibility of accurate depth sensing for practical real-world applications.",
        " This paper presents a novel approach to 3D semantic segmentation that uses contextual neighborhood information to improve the accuracy of the results. Unlike existing methods that focus on features of the points or on the global context, our method explicitly models the relationships between the points of the environment to capture the finer geometric structure and the semantic dependencies. We introduce a neighborhood-awareness mechanism, NAM, which dynamically collects the information of the surrounding points and makes them influential by means of an attention mechanism. Our experiments on Scannet, S3DIS, and SemanticKITTI demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially in the accuracy of delineating boundaries and in the recognition of small objects. The amputation experiments show that NAM is critical for learning from the local context, resulting in more consistent segmentation even for sparse data or complex scenes. Our framework works directly on raw point clouds without devoting any time to voxelization or projection, and therefore preserves geometric fidelity while being efficient to compute. Lastly, we discuss the impact of our method on the perception of 3D scenes and how it can be extended to better understand them.",
        " The appended page is the abstract. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to analyze and compare multivariate time series. We combine unsupervised representation learning and locality-sensitive hashing. Our goal is to detect early hypotensive events in critical care settings. The approach is tested on the MIMIC-III database of multivariate hemodynamics. It achieves sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 86% for detecting impending hypotensive episodes at two hours before onset. It also has a speedup of 41%. This paper thus presents a scalable methodology to compute similarity of time series. This combines efficiency with clinical relevance and can be used for real-time risk stratification and early intervention in critical care settings.",
        " The medical image segmentation task is difficult due to the complexity of the anatomical structures, low contrast and large variations between patients. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown excellent performance at capturing local features, they lack the ability to model long-range dependencies, while transformers can successfully deal with long-range dependencies, but are less good at capturing fine-grained local features, which are necessary for the accurate delineation of boundaries. However, the combination of the two architectures is possible with “transFuse”: a combination of a recurrent neural network (an automatic learning classifier) and a “convolutional neural network” that connects the two. ,, which is the combination of the two, and the proposed “attentional mechanism” that can dynamically adjust the relative contribution of the two branches according to the input complexity. This method is promising for the future of medical image segmentation by combining the strengths of different deep learning approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple medical image data sets, including polyp segmentation, CT-lung, and multi-organ abdominal CT, show that TransFuse outperforms the best state-of-the-art methods, while retaining good efficiency.",
        " Unsupervised object discovery and co-localization by deep descriptor transformation: Unlike supervised methods that require extensive labeled data, our framework is based on pre-trained convolutional neural networks and automatically locates objects in images without the need for labeled data. Compared with previous methods, the proposed method is efficient in terms of computing time, while maintaining the ability to deal with a wide variety of objects and scenes. Through extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC, ImageNet and object-discovery datasets, DDT has outperformed other methods in the co-location accuracy of objects in images, with an average increase of 11.8 percent. Our method has also been demonstrated to be effective in tasks such as object localization and weakly supervised object detection, demonstrating its broad applicability and practical value in the real world.",
        " To take advantage of the inherent symmetry of many games—resistance to rotations, permutations, and reflections—we develop a framework that respects these symmetries by construction. We apply group theory to design neural network layers which are equivariant with respect to the symmetry groups, and thus guarantee that learned representations are always transformed in a predictable way under the group action. Finite-group equivariant neural networks for games based on this framework can be used to build symmetry-aware agents which learn more efficiently from experience while maintaining invariance to irrelevant transformations of the game state. We show that such equivariant neural networks not only greatly reduce the amount of parameters and the number of samples required, but also have improved generalization to unseen game states and enhanced transfer learning across related games. Experimental results for board games, card games, and strategy video games show significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art, especially in low-data situations. We conclude by highlighting some of the advantages of this framework and discussing future directions.",
        " Among the simplest forms of a method of explaining the prediction of a tree-based boosting method is the technique of composing decision trees from the features of a collection of trees. The XGBoost, Light GBM and CatBoost tree-based boosting methods are becoming a powerful tool for the prediction of many kinds of data. But their complexity and the large number of trees constitute a serious obstacle to their interpretability. Our approach takes advantage of the inherent structure of decision trees to extract the importance of features, the interaction between them and the paths through which they are linked. Using extensive experiments on synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that our methods produce more accurate and consistent explanations than surrogate methods. We propose both local and global explanation methods to gain insights into the behavior of a boosted decision tree. We present an implementation that is compatible with popular boosting libraries and enables practitioners to enhance the interpretability of their models without sacrificing performance. We also present case studies illustrating how these explanations can detect biases, validate the behavior of the model against domain knowledge and guide feature engineering.",

INTRODUCTION This paper presents a novel approach to dynamically optimize product delivery schedules by using reinforcement learning (RL) methods. The proposed approach reduces the total transportation costs by 18.7% and improves the delivery success rate by 14.3% compared to the conventional method. The proposed system learns from historical data, customer satisfaction, inventory costs, transportation costs and order lateness, and makes real-time decisions that combine service quality and operational efficiency. In the end, customer satisfaction and profits are improved.",
        " Graph signal processing is a technique for processing and analyzing signals defined in a graph. We will survey the fundamental concepts of GSP, such as graph spectral theory, graph filters, and graph wavelets, and review how these tools extend classical signal processing to graphs. It will then show how GSP can provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the effectiveness and limitations of graph-based learning methods, and it will also suggest new directions for further research on the challenges posed by large-scale graphs, adaptivity, theoretical guarantees, and applications to dynamic graphs. We will also survey the applications of GSP to graph learning, including the applications of community detection, semi-supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction. This survey helps to bridge the gap between signal processing and machine learning, and provides new directions for future research on graph-based learning.",
        " This paper is concerned with the fundamental complexity of learning when the experimental policy is different from the policy whose performance is being studied. We establish novel finite-sample bounds that characterize how the distribution mismatch between the experimental and target policies affects the learning efficiency. We also show that the sample complexity is strongly influenced by the concentrability coefficient, a measure of the extent to which the experimental policy and the target policy cover the state-action space. We prove a lower bound which shows that this dependence is unavoidable in general. Moreover, we propose a novel sampling strategy that automatically adapts to the available data and is almost as efficient as standard importance sampling for good state-action coverage, while being robust to bad state-action coverage. We present experimental results that show that these theoretical insights translate into practical performance improvements, compared to existing batch-learning methods. Our results give a precise understanding of the fundamental limits of learning when the experimental policy is not the target policy, and guide the design of efficient batch-learning methods.",
        " Such as the Preceptor, a unified, uni-directionally self-organized, abstract neural network, which imposes no constraints on the number of links between nodes, and thus has the property of operating in all possible directions. To remedy this defect, we propose a new type of neural network whose action is bi-directional, a graph neural network whose functions are only to act as low-pass filters, but which in addition to this have a bi-directionality... Then there are two different modes of operation, a forward mode and a reverse mode. The reverse mode, in its turn, acts as a special low-pass filter. The graph neural network is a two-mode neural network. Therefore, its implementations are quite simple, as shown by our experiments.",

To solve this difficulty, I had an eye for such things as would enable me to compose a sum of pictures, which I called a result. But it was my imagination. I had to make it visual. My imagination had to be physical. This chapter will tell you about some of these matters. I present my methods for designing operators for neural networks to handle the three-dimensional irregular structures.",
        " The Hierarchical Graph-Recurrent Neural Net-work for Multi-Action Detection in Videos This paper presents a novel approach to the detection of actions in videos containing multiple activities. Conventional methods are not able to cope with scenes in which there are multiple subjects performing different actions simultaneously. Our framework is able to overcome these limitations by modelling both spatial and temporal relationships in a hierarchical manner. This hierarchical structure allows the representation of both fine-grained actions and their more general con-text. We test our framework on three challenging datasets: AVA, MultiTHUMOS, and Charades. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance. The proposed method shows considerable potential for improving the understanding of complex multi-person, multi-action scenes in a variety of applications, including surveillance, sport analysis, and human behaviour analysis. Specifically, our framework achieves 5.2% more mAP on AVA and a 4.7% improvement on F1 on MultiTHUMOS over previous methods.",
        " This is an under-studied problem in classification, where the relative proportions of the classes in the different domains are substantially different. In this paper we introduce a novel procedure called batch-weighted fusion which dynamically adjusts the contribution of the examples for the training based on their estimated relevance to the target distribution. These batch-weighted fusion weights are obtained by a very simple mechanism, and we prove theoretically that the batch-weighted fusion approach can improve domain transfer when the shift is severe. Extensive experiments on a variety of standard data sets demonstrate that batch-weighted fusion outperforms the state-of-the-art for domain adaptation, and that the reduction of domain discrepancy is particularly effective under mass shift conditions. Our approach is insensitive to changes in the network architecture, and requires negligible computational costs, thereby making it a viable solution to this important practical problem of varying class proportions between domains.",
        " Deep Reinforcement Learning has remarked great successes in many different applications, but it is still vulnerable to attacks. This paper presents a new method of poisoning DRL agents that embeds subtle, in-distribution triggers in the environment of DRL agents. In contrast to existing methods that rely on outside triggers, our method produces triggers that are largely consistent with the legitimate state distribution, making them difficult to detect. Our experiments show that attacks can be successful even with small percentages of poisoned training data (less than 5% of training episodes), and that current anomaly detection methods with detection rates of less than 15% of triggers cannot reliably detect the attacks. We show that poisoned agents can perform normally under normal conditions, but will exhibit a blatant suboptimal behavior under special conditions when the triggers are activated. We also characterize the replicability of these attacks across different architectures and reinforcement learning methods, and propose countermeasures to protect against them. The above results highlight the critical importance of robust training methods to guard against in-distribution attacks for DRL systems in safety-critical applications.",

        " This paper proposes a novel framework for time-series prediction, which represents time-series data as a dynamic graph, where nodes represent states and edges represent transition probabilities that evolve over time. The framework has three main components: a state identification mechanism that automatically identifies similar states; a temporal evolution mechanism that represents the changing relationship between states over time; and a prediction layer that uses both the past and present states to predict the future. And, in view of the interpretability of the graph, we use it to explain the underlying mechanisms of the time-series data. We evaluated our framework on a large set of data including a variety of real-world data on patient health, stock-market events, and urban transportation systems. The evaluation showed a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of the proposed method, as well as a reduction in the number of false alarms, compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our framework provides a powerful combination of predictability and interpretability for time-series data.",
        " Having some difficulty in obtaining accurate instance masks in cluttered environments, we have developed RICE (Refinement of Instance masks in Cluttered Environments) to improve the quality of instance masks. The network of the mask is represented as a graph in which nodes correspond to mask regions, and edges to spatial relationships between them. Using this graph, we introduce a “boundary-aware” mechanism which focuses the attention on the ambiguous areas while preserving the distinct contours of the object. In experiments with COCO-Cluttered, Cityscapes and our newly introduced ClutterNet, RICE consistently improves the mask quality of multiple baseline models, with up to a 5.2% improvement in accuracy of the mask and a 7.8% improvement in the accuracy of the mask edges. Moreover, the GNN learns to reason about the boundaries of objects by aggregating the contextual information available across the entire network, enabling more accurate refinement decisions even in highly cluttered scenes. RICE is a model-independent solution which can be easily incorporated into the instance segmentation pipeline. Experiments on instance occlusions and removals indicate that our GNN-based approach outperforms conventional methods.",
        " This paper introduces Spectral Graph Learning (SGL), a new framework for learning graphs from measurements. SGL formulates graph learning as an optimization problem in the spectral domain, where we simultaneously estimate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian that best explains the measurements. We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of SGL under a variety of sample and noise conditions. We show that SGL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially when measurements are sparse or noisy. Unlike existing methods that impose structural constraints in the spatial domain, our spectral formulation naturally reflects smoothness properties, while allowing for fast inference. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including brain connectivity graphs, social interaction graphs, and wireless sensor networks, demonstrate that SGL can outperform the state-of-the-art. SGL provides a principled approach to learning graphs from measurements, with applications in network science, signal processing, and graph learning.",
        " The expressive power of neural networks in modelling probabilistic distributions is examined. Various neural network architectures are analysed with respect to their ability to approximate complex distributions with finitely many parameters. Detailed results of the accuracy of the approximation are gathered, establishing that a neural network with many layers can efficiently represent a wider class of distributions than its shallower counterpart. We demonstrate through extensive empirical testing on synthetic and real-world data that a properly designed neural network can model the structure and complexity of multimodal, tailed, and hierarchical distributions with great success. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the use of neural networks in probability modelling, and practical guidelines for designing network architectures suited to specific distributional properties. It is shown that for certain distribution families the required number of parameters increases only polynomially with the desired accuracy of the approximation, whereas for other distributions, an exponentially large number of parameters is required.",
        " This paper presents a new method of place recognition in three-dimensional point clouds, which uses semantic knowledge encoded in graph-based representations. Unlike existing point-cloud recognition systems, which focus on geometrical properties of the cloud, our method combines the semantic knowledge in a hierarchical manner in order to ensure robustness against the changing environment and the viewpoint. Our extensive experiments on urban datasets have shown that our method, using a hierarchical structure of the points, performs better than geometrical methods in the presence of seasonal variations, moving objects, and partial observations. Its performance is sufficiently fast to enable real-time performance in navigation systems. Our method first segments the point cloud into semantic entities, then constructs a graph-based representation, and then uses a graph-based matching technique to perform the recognition. We believe that this paper bridges the gap between semantic scene understanding and place recognition, and suggests a new approach for robust localization in complex 3D environments.",
        " On the basis of the dual nature of the various low-level vision tasks, we propose a dual convolutional neural network, Dual-CNN, that has two parallel branches, each of which is designed to recover the inversely complementary components of an image. This dual structure is not only quantifiably better than other models, but also produces a superior visual result with less distortion and noise. The dual architecture is achieved by a weight-splitting mechanism and a dual-objective regularization mechanism, allowing the two branches to cooperate while retaining their own specialties. Extensive experiments show that our dual architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on many difficult problems, including image denoising, super-resolution, and JPEG recovery. The Dual-CNN framework is flexible and can be easily adapted to various low-level vision tasks, without the need to design new architectures for different tasks. In addition, our ablation experiments show that the dual branch is more effective than the single-branch counterpart with the same number of parameters.",
        " In spite of the comparative comprehensibility of decision trees with respect to other machine-learning models, understanding the decision process remains difficult, particularly for complex trees with many nodes or involving high-dimensional data. We introduce Illuminated Decision Trees, a new visualization framework for interpreting decision trees using Lucid, an open-source interpretability library. The framework supports both classification and regression trees, and is flexible to accommodate the needs of different kinds of analyses. Experiments show that the framework can highlight model weaknesses and potential improvements 37% faster than existing visualization methods. In the application to various datasets, we demonstrate that the new visual representations reveal hidden patterns in the decision process. The work makes decision trees more transparent and accessible to both technical and nontechnical audiences.",
        " We present NAS-FCOS, a new, highly efficient neural architecture search framework, which is designed for a particular task, namely the detection of an object without the need for any reference. The architecture search NAS is well known to work well in a large number of vision tasks, but the task of object detection remains a difficult one because of the computational difficulty of the task. NAS is a new framework for a highly efficient neural architecture search for object detection, and based on the highly efficient FCOS (fully convolutional one-stage) object detection network, it automatically explores the architecture design space of object detection networks, maintaining real-time performance, even in a large-scale setting. In order to reduce the high cost of architecture search, a gradient-based method is used to share weights and the search time from thousands of days of the whole scene to a few days of a single GPU. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO dataset show that the automatically discovered architectures can achieve the best performance in the current literature among unsupervised-detection networks. At the same time, their running speed is similar to that of hand-designed architectures. Our work shows the potential of automatic architecture design for object detection tasks, and a hint for future work in this direction. NAS-FCOS achieves a test accuracy of 44.26%, which is higher than that of the original FCOS by 3.56%, but still has similar efficiency.",
        " The authors introduced a new method, called Deep Input Transfer (DIT), which drastically reduces the computational cost of inference by rethinking the traditional data preparation stage of the network, but retains essential features. This leads to improved performance, and more efficient performance, with lower resources. DIT is compatible with the information preservation properties of the network, and an open source implementation is released to encourage the development of different models. The experiments on image, language and multi-source learning tasks showed that DIT reduced the execution time by 37 to 52%, and the error rate was 0.5% less than that of the original model.. This paper is a significant advance in the exploitation of deep learning.",
        " This paper describes DeepPerimeter, a novel method for the estimation of indoor architectural boundaries from monocular, posed images. DeepPerimeter uses a two-stage architecture: a first network for recognizing features on individual frames, and a second network for fusing features across multiple viewpoints, with the known poses of the camera. DeepPerimeter achieves state-of-the-art results on Scannet and Matterport3D datasets, with a 27% improvement in accuracy over previous methods. We use geometric priors specific to indoor environments, such as the Manhattan assumption and typical room configurations, to regularize the estimation. DeepPerimeter's results provide a light-weight, yet informative representation of indoor spaces that can be used for the generation of floor plans, navigation, and augmented reality.",
        " Generative adversarial networks have shown remarkable performance in generating high-quality synthetic data in various fields. Mode collapse is a well-known problem in GANs; the problem is that the generative model may fail to capture the full diversity of the original distribution. This paper introduces a new method for addressing mode collapse in GANs using leverage score sampling, which borrows a technique from randomized numerical linear algebra. The theoretical results show that our method can ensure full coverage of the distribution under certain conditions. We develop a framework to identify the under-represented modes in the training distribution, based on the leverage scores that we computed for individual data points. By strategically sampling the regions of the high-leverage scores during training, we can encourage the generator to explore the entire data manifold. The proposed method requires minimal changes to the architecture of the GANs and incurs negligible computation costs. We show in experiments with synthetic data and real-world data that the data diversity obtained by our method is significantly higher than that obtained by other methods. We show that the mode coverage can be improved by up to 35%. Moreover, we show that our method can maintain comparable sample quality.",
        " A System of Temporal-Logical Derivation in Neural-fitted Q-iteration. Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement-learning method that embeds formal logical constraints directly into the Q-function, effectively shaping the policy search space to put the constraints at the top of the priority list in the search for the maximum reward. The system learns policies that prove to satisfy the constraints, and it is demonstrated in a number of situations where the logical constraints are evaluated as differentiable penalties in the neural-fitted Q-iteration loss. We provide theoretical guarantees on constraint satisfaction for some situations, and discuss the trade-offs between constraint strictness and exploration power. The experimental results show that LC-Q consistently outperforms unconstrained methods and alternative constraint-handling methods in constraint satisfaction, and at the same time it achieves a reward performance that is equal or superior to unconstrained methods.",
        " Meta-reinforcement learning allows an agent to rapidly adapt to new tasks by deploying the knowledge of similar ones encountered before. However, meta-reinforcement learning approaches are not particularly effective at personalizing agents for heterogeneous tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to characterize the divergence of policy in meta-reinforcement learning with personalization. Our approach models the trade-off between retaining a generalizable meta-policy and allowing task-specific specialization. Using this framework, we establish theoretical bounds on the sample complexity of the learning and adaptation process, and show how policy divergence can be used to improve the adaptation efficiency. Our theoretical results uncover insights into the fundamentals of meta-learning on heterogeneous task spaces, and our solution leads to improved performance in various experiments, compared to state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning methods. Experimental results on diverse environments, including the MuJoCo robot task and the PICOS multi-user recommendation system, show that our approach achieves a 45% improvement in the adaptation efficiency and a 32% improvement in the asymptotic performance over current meta-reinforcement learning methods.",
        " Objects Localization by Drawing-Guided Search of Natural Images.—This paper presents a novel approach to the localization of objects in natural images by means of hand-drawn sketches, which enables a more intuitive and flexible localization of objects based on the visual similarity of sketches to natural images. Here we introduce a new dataset for sketch-image pairs with annotations on the position of objects. Extensive experiments on different data sets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of existing methods of retrieval based on hand-drawn sketches adapted for object localization, achieving an average 12.3% increase in precision over the state-of-the-art. Our approach shows promising results for content-based image retrieval, interactive image editing, and visual search. User studies have shown that it is more intuitive to search with our method than by textual descriptions, especially for objects with well-defined shapes but ambiguous descriptions.",
        " In place of complicated methods which involve elaborate architectures or side objectives, S4RL uses only a minimum of data-augmentation and data-comparison to create additional training signals, enabling robust policy learning from a fixed number of examples. S4RL: Surprisingly Simple Self-Supervision for Offline Reinforcement Learning The method's simplicity makes it easy to integrate into existing frameworks, while at the same time significantly improving both efficiency and performance. In extensive experiments on D4RL, a popular test of the state of the art in offline reinforcement learning, we show that S4RL reliably outperforms the best existing methods, especially in those experiments where the data is sparse or of poor quality.",
        " The author(s) have discovered a new way of representing the state of a model, which consists in replacing some of the weights of the decision-making mechanism with a suitable weighting of the concept probabilities. These weights are so far obtained in an iterative manner by multiplying the weights of the previous layer. In the future, as the weights decrease, they will preferably be obtained directly from the data, using a procedure based on information theory. Using a large number of experiments on image classification, natural language and health data, we demonstrate that our method produces more complete explanations than existing methods, while maintaining interpretability. We define the degree of completeness of the model in relation to its features by means of a number of metrics which have been derived. This paper represents a significant step towards trustworthy AI systems, capable of generating explanations that are faithful to the processes that have led to their decisions. We show that explanations based on completeness can also highlight errors in the model and in the concept annotation.",

Such graphs have become increasingly important for modeling dynamic relations in various domains such as social networks, financial transactions and recommendation systems. GTEA represents the temporal aspects of interactions by a special aggregation mechanism on edges. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets show that GTEA outperforms previous models on many tasks, including link prediction, node classification and temporal pattern discovery. Furthermore, the proposed method provides a theoretical analysis showing that GTEA generalizes many existing graph embeddings. The proposed model is flexible and powerful, and has the potential to be a useful tool for reasoning about temporal aspects of graph-structured data.",

I’ll show you how, using the photochromic principle, a series of mathematical formulae and illustrations, we produced the following image: Why? Because our method increases in direct proportion to the input, and allows the attentional principle to work at a scale that was previously too great, without losing its intrinsic advantages.",
        " Yet GNNs are privacy-intrusive, as they require the input of the features and structural information of the nodes. The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel approach to preserving privacy in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by means of the application of differentially private mechanisms. Hence we propose “Location Private” GNNs (LP-GNNs) with such mechanisms and which ensure the privacy of the nodes and the overall structure of the network. We further prove, using a theoretical analysis, that the resulting mechanism achieves an optimum balance between privacy and utility, and that it can achieve good results on node classification, link prediction and graph classification tasks, while ensuring a high level of privacy. Therefore, LP-GNNs can be regarded as a practical solution for learning decentralized and private graph representations in an environment where privacy-preserving methods are insufficient.",
        " While wind power is an important source of electricity, it is still difficult to incorporate into the national grid, owing to the variability and lack of predictability of wind speeds. We introduce a new method for predicting short-term wind speeds based on kernel spectral hidden Markov models. As shown in the experiments, this method significantly outperforms other methods in predicting wind speeds in various regions of the world. It has a particularly good performance in capturing sudden wind speed changes and maintains accuracy during periods of high variability. Our method maps the wind speed data to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which allows more flexible representation of the state than traditional hidden Markov models. As such, the method could be used to increase the accuracy of short-term wind speed forecasts and thus enhance the economic and operational benefits of wind power. We also present a theoretical guarantee of the convergence of our spectral learning procedure.",
        " This paper carries out a comprehensive analysis of the relation of the performance of an ai in ai-dependent systems, the accuracy required and the adaptability demanded by ai-dependent systems. The paper examines recent progress in transfer learning, in domain adaptation, and in robust ai-architectures which enable autonomous systems to generalize successfully to situations outside their training domains. This analysis highlights a number of emerging approaches which promote generalization without compromising accuracy, such as meta-learning, self-supervised learning, and ongoing adaptation. The paper identifies key challenges, such as the problems of distribution shifts, sim-to-real transfer, and performance degradation in new contexts, and outlines future research directions towards the development of reliable ai-dependent systems which perform reliably under varying conditions, and which meet stringent requirements for accuracy. This review is intended to serve as a starting point for future research and development at the critical boundary between ai-dependency and generalization.",
        " This article is devoted to the problem of universality of neural networks that have as their aim the preservation of group invariances. Our result is that the architecture of invariant neural networks greatly influences the nature of their capacity to approximate, certain designs can universally approximate within the class of invariant functions, but others are fundamentally restricted. With a theoretical and an empirical analysis, we show that the proposed principles of architecture lead to more efficient invariant neural networks that learn more complex invariant functions with fewer parameters than invariant neural networks built on the basis of conventional architectures. We prove that properly designed invariant neural networks can be universal while respecting symmetry for a wide class of compact groups, and we characterize the minimal architectural requirements for this universality. The results have a practical significance in determining the principles of designing invariant neural networks in such domains as physics, chemistry, and computer vision.",
        " We report a method of obtaining the colouring of images by a generative system, the data of which are simulated by means of a GAN. This paper represents a new and original method of colorizing grey-tone images without human intervention. Unlike previous methods, which are either deterministic or need human supervision, ours produces a set of possible colourings for a given grey-tone image without requiring any human intervention. Our experiments on the data of various well-known public databases show that our method is much more diverse than the previous ones, and also that it does not lose in quality. A survey of the public shows that our colourings are difficult to distinguish from real ones. The proposed method has important applications in image restoration, content creation, and data augmentation, allowing to obtain a large number of colorization variants of high perceptual quality and semantic plausibility.",
        " A new method for learning visual representations from unlabelled video data is presented. The rich temporal structure of the videos is utilized to automatically learn generalized and meaningful features. The method relies on the intrinsic consistency of the successive frames and the need to predict the next frame or the next frames of the sequence. Deep convolutional networks are trained to make this prediction and to extract features from the scene. The network is trained on large scales and the deep architectures learn to extract useful information from the visual content. The method outperforms other unsupervised learning methods based on still images. The study also highlights the value of unlabelled data available from the web for learning general visual representations.",
        " Super-resolution (SR) models, which were trained with a great variety of images, often suffer when applied to new domains with markedly different statistical distributions. To this problem, we have devised a novel test-time adaptation scheme for SR which requires no previous knowledge of the new domain, and which we have called SR-OTTO (Super-Resolution with Overfitting on Test-Time Only). SR-OTTO outperforms traditional SR methods and other test-time adaptation methods in all kinds of experiments, and can achieve up to a 2.1 dB PSNR improvement on challenging real-world images. In addition, it is fast, adapting in less than ten seconds on standard hardware. Moreover, it captures the local structure of the degradation process of the new domain while preserving the general super-resolution properties of the base model. The general lesson from our work is that controlled overfitting can be a powerful way to achieve rapid adaptation in image restoration tasks, and that this may be a useful tool for systems with resource-constrained deployment.",
        " It has been known for some time that we can learn the attention structure in a relational neural network, by learning to memorize it for a while and then connecting it to an existing model. Dual Semantic Relations Graph Attention Network for Image-Text Matching The task of comparing the similarity of images and texts is a fundamental task of vision-language interaction, which seeks to establish a correspondence between visual elements and their textual counterparts. This paper introduces a new heuristic of image-text matching, which is based on learning a Dual Semantic Relations Graph Attention Network, which is able to represent both intra- and inter-modal semantic relations. Through this dual-graph representation, the model is able to better align semantically related components across modalities, while preserving structural information within each modalities. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets show that the DSR-GAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on bi-directional retrieval tasks. The main innovation is that the receptive field of this graph is used to dynamically weight these semantic relations based on the relevance of the task. This work provides new insights into the importance of structured semantic representations for cross-modal understanding tasks. The omission experiments also show the effectiveness of the dual semantic relation model.",
        " This paper aims to overcome two fundamental limitations of Siamese networks in visual object tracking: (1) the limitations in depth of the network and (2) the receptive fields. We discuss the ways to solve these limitations and apply the model to solve them. In this paper, we introduce a layer-based method to preserve the accuracy of deep layers, and we use dilation convolution to increase the effective area. The experiments on the OTB100, VOT2018 and LaSOT trackers show that the depth and width of the Siamese network can be greatly improved, and the performance of the Siamese network can reach the current state of the art, while the speed can be maintained at more than 50 FPS. Our work establishes a new framework for Siamese tracking frameworks that can effectively use the power of deep learning. The proposed architecture improvement has a relative accuracy improvement of 10% compared to previous Siamese trackers, without using any additional data or complicated optimization strategies.",
        " I am so excited that I have to bring a paper to a present at the Society for Information Display that is now in its tenth year. Cross-Domain Transfer Learning for enhancing Template-based SSVEP Decoding. I proposed a two-stage strategy, where first the distribution of the features of the two domains was adapted, and then the reconstructed templates were fine-tuned with minimal calibration samples. The experiments on a multi-person SSVEP database showed that our method outperformed the original method in accuracy by 15.2% and required only 20% of the calibration samples. Our method takes advantage of the existing knowledge from a large number of samples in the source domain to improve the classification accuracy of a small amount of samples in the target domain. The experiments also showed that the performance of our method was unaffected by the quality of the signals or by the variability of the SSVEP signals between sessions. The proposed method is a promising solution to the calibration bottleneck in SSVEP-based BCIs.",
        " As the use of electric vehicles increases, the question of their charging becomes important in order to prevent overloads and reduce the cost of electricity. Unlike the methods based on the dynamic of the grid and the behavior of the users, which require a detailed knowledge of these phenomena, our method directly learns the best charging policy from the actual data in the environment. Definition and evaluation of model-free reinforcement learning of electrical vehicle charging with reinforcement learning. The authors use a model-free reinforcement learning method for determining a charging policy for electrical vehicles, with the objective of reducing the cost of electricity, reducing the impact on the grid, and improving the satisfaction of users. Our model-free method, with extensive evaluation on the data of urban electrical vehicles from metropolitan charging stations, demonstrates a decrease of 18% in electricity costs and a reduction of 23% in peak load compared to uncoordinated charging. Compared with the methods based on models, it also provides similar performance. It is thus possible to assume that reinforcement learning can provide a scalable and dynamic method of guiding the charging of electric vehicles in a smart grid. Our method also adapts to changes in the grid and the demands of the users without requiring a recalibration of the system.",
        " END-TO-END LEARNING, a powerful machine learning tool, enables learning directly from the first to the second, without requiring feature engineering or intermediate representations. But the limit of end-to-end learning is a subject of controversy. Despite many successes in the field of vision, language and robots, end-to-end learning is restricted by the lack of huge data to train it, by the difficulty of introducing knowledge and experience into the models, by the impossibility of interpreting and interpreting the models, by the low performance in a low-data environment, and by the difficulty of predicting accurately under conditions of scarce data. This paper gives a more subtle understanding of the circumstances in which end-to-end learning should be applied, and of the ways to overcome its limitations. It suggests the necessity of future research to develop frameworks that preserve the power of end-to-end learning, while overcoming its limitations by judicious combinations of complementary methods.",
        " This paper presents a new approach to the detection of salient objects by exploiting the perceptual and linguistic characteristics of the color name space. Unlike conventional methods, which rely mainly on color features mapped from the RGB or other standard color spaces, we show that the color name space, which identifies colors with linguistic terms, can also be used to identify visually prominent objects. This is especially true for images where the prominent objects have unusual colors or stand out against a complex background. The experimental results on five standard image datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of F-measure and mean absolute error. This work establishes the color name space as an important higher-level feature for saliency detection and suggests new directions for using linguistic color representations in computer vision tasks. The proposed method is computationally efficient and produces saliency maps that are more compatible with human visual perception.",
        " The paper \"Attention-based Feature Selector\" presents a novel supervised feature selection method that uses attention to extract the most useful features for classification and regression tasks. Unlike the existing feature selection methods that rely on the mean, the mode, and the extreme value of a few tuples, AFS relies on a neural network architecture whose architecture is end-to-end differentiable, where a single attention layer is integrated in the network. Furthermore, AFS provides a clear feature importance ranking, and it has high efficiency. Experimental results on a wide variety of data sets show that AFS always outperforms the existing methods, such as filters, wrappers, and embedded features. And in the case of complex data, AFS is also better than a single feature. The proposed method is especially useful in handling complex data.",
        " Thence to a larger meaning, we have suggested a way to adapt the model to the data that is degraded in real life. The framework we propose distills the knowledge of a model trained on clean data into another, which is then to be employed in a degraded environment. A distilled model maintains up to 92% of its original performance in a severely degraded environment, whereas the performance of a non-distilled model is down to less than 65%. Our method is a two-stage one: first, a teacher model is trained on clean data, and then its knowledge is distilled into a student model, which is subjected to a systematic degradation. Using this method, we have shown that a distilled model outperforms a non-distilled model in the presence of degradation.",
        " Some new forms of deep learning have been developed for the processing of 3D point clouds, but all of them require a great deal of labeled data, which is expensive and time consuming to collect. We propose a new learning framework for 3D point cloud semantics, SSPC-Net, which exploits the benefits of both labeled and unlabeled training data. The SSPC-Net architecture includes a teacher-pupil model and a consistency mechanism that promotes knowledge transfer from labeled to unlabeled data. In extensive experiments on a S3DIS, ScanNet and SemanticKITTI, SSPC-Net shows that with a fraction of the data used by fully supervised methods, SSPC-Net can achieve similar performance. Our results suggest that SSPC-Net could be a promising solution for real-world applications where the labeled data is scarce but the unlabeled data is abundant. The sub-layers of SSPC-Net have also been tested, and we confirm the effectiveness of each proposed component.",
        " The devil, as usual, always seems to be on the point of seizing on someone, and so I will begin my story by saying that it is not that of the princes and barons. The question remains whether the state of the state was inherited from the Kings, or if the Prince was a friend of the Court. This paper demonstrates that the relevance policy network can effectively capture out-of-distribution inputs without training on outliers, provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and maintains strong predictive performance against state-of-the-art methods. The results of extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world data show that the network can provide robust uncertainty quantification while remaining computationally efficient. It is shown that this network is particularly suited to applications that require the highest level of uncertainty estimation for safety-critical applications.",
        " An analogue to federated learning, this paper aims to overcome the problems of data heterogeneity and of communication in distributed learning environments. Using a dual-level knowledge distillation, a local calibration mechanism aligns the feature spaces of the different clients with respect to their prototypes, and a global projection based on these local alignments provides a consistent feature representation across the federation. The proposed approach not only advances the state of the art in federated visual representation learning, but also provides insights into the effect of communication in privacy-preserving distributed learning. Our experiments on several vision datasets with varying degrees of heterogeneity show that PG-FL improves the accuracy of classification in a heterogeneous data environment by a factor of 7.2, while communication costs are reduced by 35%.",
        " Our systems are used in the USA and India, as also in China, and have a great effect upon the intellectual development of the country. This article presents a new system of the most general form for the determination of the motion of the actor, the critic and the guide in the problem of channel selection. The system is very flexible under changing conditions and may be applied to large systems.

The method has been successfully tested with two systems in which the noise was measured at the 808 and 862 MHz bands, and it is successfully applied to the practical system with several tens of thousands of users. The heuristic method is a great improvement in the efficient use of the available channel resources for a wireless system.",
        " This paper presents a new approach to the estimation of optical distortion by modelling the refractive surface of the lens. This approach is able to reproduce complex distortion patterns found in different imaging systems such as underwater photography, the glass image, and medical endoscopy. The refractive surface is modelled using a simple parameterisation, and complex distortion patterns are modeled by the same parameterisation. The estimation of distortion using this method is performed by inversely solving the problem of determining the refractive surface from the observed distortion. Compared to existing methods, it produces a geometric distortion with a geometric error of only a third. It is possible to correct distortions by modelling different geometrical phenomena and thus making the reduction of geometrical distortions easier. The present paper combines the theories of optics and of computation, and also has practical applications in the field of machine vision in distorted environments.",
        " This paper presents a systematic comparison of end-to-end approaches for handwritten number string recognition. We compare conventional segmentation-based methods with modern deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and attention-based transformers. The experiments are conducted on several datasets, such as MNIST, SVHN and IAM-digits, where digits are connected and writing styles are different. However, attention-based architectures can achieve 97.3% accuracy on a complex number string. In addition, we study the complexity of the learning method and its inference speed, providing insight into practical deployments. The detailed comparison of the current state-of-the-art is expected to establish a new comparison standard for the field, and to provide guidance on the choice of the recognition method.",

But, unlike them, we do not know of their actual opinions. Temporal Knowledge Consistency for Unsupervised Representation Learning: Temporal Knowledge Consistency for Unsupervised Representation Learning introduces a novel learning method for unsupervised visual representation learning that exploits the temporal coherence inherent in videos. Through a large number of experiments on the standard ImageNet, COCO, and action recognition tasks, TKC is able to achieve better performance than state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods, while consuming fewer resources. Our method is particularly strong in a weakly supervised setting, which suggests that temporal knowledge consistency effectively captures the deep, visual representations that generalize across different visual understanding tasks.",
        " Many of the existing approaches to three-dimensional image segmentation are faced with the problem of balancing speed with accuracy, especially in the face of large volumes. This paper introduces a new method for three-dimensional image segmentation which, through the use of a data-swapping technique, provides both a considerable increase in speed and accuracy. This data-swapping technique is particularly effective in the case of structures with complex morphologies and indistinct boundaries. The data-swapping technique takes advantage of the similarities in neighbouring regions while reducing the number of calculations. Experiments with different volumes of medical images, including MRI, CT, and ultrasonic images, show that our method achieves a reduction of up to 40% in the processing time while simultaneously improving the accuracy of the segmentation, by 8–12%, as compared with existing methods. These results show that the proposed data-swapping method is a major advance in three-dimensional image segmentation and may have important clinical applications in terms of speed, for example, in the areas of surgery, diagnostics, and the like. In addition, the method is hardly memory-consuming and is therefore appropriate for deployment in a clinical setting with a limited memory.",
        " A paper on risk bounds for unsupervised domain mapping by the use of integral probability metrics. This paper develops a theoretical framework which makes use of integral probability metrics (IPM) for obtaining a rigorous risk bound for unsupervised domain mapping. It provides a principled alternative to existing adversarial methods by providing explicitly the statistical guarantees of domain mappings. The framework allows arbitrary IPM such as the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and Wasserstein distances, thereby enabling a flexible exploitation of domain-specific properties. We show how the risk bounds are minimax under standard assumptions. Our theoretical and experimental results establish a statistically principled yet practically effective theory for unsupervised domain mapping. Empirical evaluation on synthetic data and on real-world domain mappings shows that our IPM-based framework not only provides theoretical guarantees but also achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",
        " Some former approaches to the problem of unsupervised skill learning have been successful, but they often failed to discover skills that exploited the environment’s underlying dynamics. Our approach, which we call ‘dynamic skill learning’, remedies this problem by learning a model of the environment simultaneously with the skill. Experimental results show that this combination of models leads to the discovery of more useful and transferable skills. In theoretical analysis we demonstrate that our method can lead to skills that are diverse in both form and function. We propose a new objective function, a mutual information objective, which encourages skills to not only be distinguishable, but also to have an effect on the dynamics of the environment. Our results indicate that dynamic awareness is essential to the unsupervised discovery of useful skills by embodied agents. In addition, when the discovered skills are used as primitives in hierarchical reinforcement learning, the performance of the agent is substantially improved.",
        " According to the team's report, \"Cryptocurrency Portfolio Management with Deep Reinforcement Learning\": We introduce a deep reinforcement learning method to allocate resources between multiple cryptocurrencies by combining a deep neural network architecture with reinforcement learning methods to dynamically allocate assets between multiple cryptocurrencies, and our model is based on market microstructure features, sentiment analysis from social media, and on-chain metrics to capture the multidimensionality of cryptocurrency valuation. We discuss the feasibility of this approach, the interpretability of its decision-making process, and the implementation of this strategy, including the effects of transaction costs and the difficulty of implementation. In an extensive backtest of historical data from the period of March, 2017 to January, 2023, which includes the bull and bear market, we show that our deep reinforcement learning method significantly outperforms the traditional portfolio optimization method and the reference strategy., with a higher risk-adjusted return of 18.37% and a lower drawdown of 12.55%. We believe that deep reinforcement learning-based asset allocation is a good solution for institutional and retail investors to effectively use the crypto asset.",
        " This paper introduces Panoster, a novel, end-to-end framework for panoply of Lidar data, which at the same time attempts to simultaneously segregate the points according to their object classes and instances. It employs a point-based backbone with a double-headed architecture, which at once attempts to predict the semantic classes for each point and to cluster the points belonging to the same object. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets show that Panoster achieves state-of-the-art results for panoply metrics, while being also suitable for real-time inferences needed for the relevant driving applications. Our ablation studies demonstrate the advantages of the joint approach over traditional methods that treat the classification and the clustering as separate problems. We propose a new loss function that manages to find a good compromise between the classifying and clustering objectives and is better suited to deal with the inherent challenges posed by the variable object size and density of Lidar point clouds. Panoster, thus, represents a more efficient and more accurate solution to the problem of scene understanding from Lidar data. The proposed framework has potential applications in robot perception, driving, and the mapping of the environment.",
        " GCNs are an unsupervised learning technique, in which the rewards are encoded as the nodes and the actions as the edges of a directed graph. This paper presents a novel approach to reinforcement learning based on a graph convolutional network (GCN). Across several domains, namely navigating in a grid world, playing a complex game, and controlling a robot, our method, called RP-GCN, is shown to achieve higher efficiency than the standard methods. Moreover, in the environment of delayed rewards, RP-GCN gives a speed-up of 45–60% over standard methods. Our method thus bridges the gap between deep learning on graphs and reinforcement learning, and enables a new avenue to solve the fundamental problems of rewarded learning. We also provide theoretical analysis demonstrating convergence guarantees under certain conditions.",
        " “When you look in vain, by a purely subjective method, at the neural architectures in a large space, a classification-wise Pareto evolution, with its reduction of complexity, is presented. We are applying this method to one-shot neural architecture search. The architecture search space is divided into the subspaces of the different classifications, which have Pareto fronts defining them, and therefore in which the accuracy and the complexity are close. It was on this subspace that we were looking. CPE has shown its efficacy in large-scale experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet training sets. CPE optimizes the components of the neural architectures in each subspace of the classifications, and thus allows a more targeted search. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the discovered architectures show better generalization for various tasks. The proposed method not only simplifies the search process, but also reveals the relationship between the components of the neural architectures and the specific task of each classification, and thus provides a more interpretable framework for the design of neural architectures.",
        " One of the most important problems of CoSOD is the inability of present methods to learn the relationships between the images. We have developed Group Collaborative Learning (GCL), a novel framework that handles these difficulties by considering CoSOD as a group learning problem, in which each image in a group collaborates with its peers. The GCL framework includes a group consensus loss, which explicitly encourages consistent prediction across related images while preserving the features of distinct objects. We conducted extensive experiments on three standard datasets: CoSOD 3k, CoCA and CoSal15, and we found that our method outperformed existing methods by a significant margin, achieving improvements in F-measure of 2.3%, 3.1% and 1.8% respectively. CoSOD results were also significantly improved by the GCL framework. We also conducted a detailed ablation study to validate the effectiveness of each individual component in the framework.",
        " Using a multiple resolution deep architecture, our method preserves both the local geometric details and the general structural context. A Hierarchical Neural Network for the Large-Scale Outdoor LiDAR Point-Cloud Mapping : “We test our approach on the KITTI and nuScenes point cloud datasets. Our approach reduces the rotation error by an average of 23% and the translation error by an average of 18% compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, our method has a low complexity and real-time performance that can be used in a navigation system. The proposed method is composed of three main components: 1) hierarchical feature extraction using hierarchical downsampling and 2) cross-attention mechanism to establish correspondences between point clouds of different hierarchical levels; 3) a hierarchical local refinement mechanism that progressively refines registration accuracy. We will make our code and trained models publicly available.”",
        " The great enemy of the science of time-series analysis is that the statistical concept of precision and recall does not provide an adequate measure of their true and false values for time series. The true values and false ones of the stadia system of performance evaluation are easily distorted by time shifts, variations in amplitude and sample rates, which we show to be effectively compensated for by a new evaluation method of our own design. Our new framework facilitates the comparison and selection of forecasting, pattern-recognition and anomaly-detection models. We propose a distance-based similarity measure which, together with the use of a learning threshold, provides a metric for determining matches between predicted and actual events, and we show that this provides a more accurate evaluation than the stadia. Our method of evaluation is based on a temporal representation of similarity, and we provide extensive experimental evidence that it produces a more accurate, more granular, and hence more usable metric of performance than that used in previous studies. This metric is found to better represent human perception of the similarity of time series, and it produces performance evaluations that are more consistent across a range of different temporal resolutions and data characteristics.",
        " Road Extraction from LiDAR point clouds remains a challenging task due to the varying point density, occlusions and complex urban environment. Our proposed network addresses these challenges by simultaneously performing road segmentation and edge detection through a dual-stream network with shared feature learning. The network is based on densely-connected dilated convolutions to capture multi-scale contextual information and spatial resolution, which are crucial for accurate road boundary extraction. The network shows improved performance on the KITTI Road and Toronto-3D datasets with an F1 score of 94.7% for road segmentation and 92.3% for edge detection, outperforms existing methods by 3.1 and 4.3 percentage points. Our joint-network learning framework enhances the road extraction accuracy in LiDAR-based perception systems. Our network is also tested on different urban and spatial conditions, and it maintains real-time performance, suitable for the autonomous driving application.",
        " This article introduces a novel scene-generation method that enables the artist to guide the content of a scene by specifying the desired class-based distribution of the content. Unlike existing methods, which use spatial layouts or purely text-based rules, our framework allows users to intuitively control the scene’s content distribution by merely specifying class-proportions (e.g., 30% sky, 25% building, 20% vegetation) and then render these class-proportions into photorealistic images. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated in several experiments, which showed that our method is superior to existing methods in terms of image quality, user control, and consistency. Our main technical contribution is a new content-guided diffusion model that automatically generates realistic layouts with respect to class-proportions. Our proposed method, called semantic palette, provides an intuitive UI for non-expert users to guide the content of the scene. It is suitable for content creation, architectural visualization, and urban planning.",
        " Both of these natural language queries lack the sensitivity to context inherent in the first two. In this paper we present a spatio-temporal transformer that combines visual features with the vehicle’s motion and the surrounding context. Using this representation, we show that it is possible to retrieve vehicles from complex, urban scenes with natural language queries. The resulting model, AYCE-VR, learns dense embeddings which match natural language queries with vehicles over multiple camera views and time instants. We test our system on a large, urban traffic dataset. We show that our system achieves a sensitivity of 77.6% to the appearance of the vehicles and a recall of 91.6%. This work represents a major step forward towards more natural human-machine interaction in the context of intelligent transportation systems and urban surveillance applications. We also show that our embeddings generalize well to new queries and across different urban contexts.",
        " This is the first method to achieve a good result for a long time without resorting to artificial data, which are sometimes not the best for the task. We deduce from this fact that the latter will invariably represent the data. This work, which combines the theory of group representations with practical deep learning architectures, offers a principled approach to the design of rotation-equivariant 3D neural networks. This model requires a significant reduction in the number of dimensions and a significant reduction in the number of functions, while ensuring an excellent degree of calculation by using convolutions adapted to spherical surfaces. Experiments show superior performance in 3D object classification, in molecular property prediction and in medical image segmentation, especially in data-limited regimes where the orientation invariance cannot be learnt by augmentation alone.",
        " Deepfakes have caused significant damage to the trust of the public in visual information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the detection of deepfakes, which consists in analyzing the traces that deepfakes leave in images during their creation process. We take advantage of the observation that deepfakes, which mainly use convolutional neural networks, leave distinct traces in the frequency domain of the images they generate. Our approach, which detects deepfakes by means of multiscale frequency analysis, is 97.3% accurate on several deepfakes datasets, improving the accuracy of existing methods by 4.8 percent. Our method is robust to post-processing operations that aim to hide the effect of the deepfakes, such as compression or blurring. Our approach, requiring few resources, can help to counter the growing sophistication of deepfakes. Moreover, we provide visualization tools to highlight the manipulated regions, thus improving the interpretability of the results.",
        " [1] The double-stream system BEV-Seg for semantic planetary segmentation uses both geometric and semantic information from 3D point clouds. BEV-Seg extracts rich geometric and semantic information from point clouds by running a separate geometric analysis and a separate semantic encoding path. These complementary representations are fused in the proposed Cross-Modal Attention Module (CMAM), which dynamically emphasizes the most relevant features from both modalities. Our approach shows particular strength in the segmentation of small objects and the disambiguation of semantically similar classes in the bird's-eye view. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse point cloud datasets show that BEV-Seg achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving the mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) by 3.1 % over previous methods. This robust solution can be used in future top-down perception systems for unmanned aerial vehicles that require accurate understanding of the environment from a bird's-eye view. We also provide a comprehensive ablation study to demonstrate the impact of each of the individual components in our framework.",
        " Presents a method for the preparation of digital surface textures from sketches by the aid of geometrical features and sampling. The sketch is first analyzed by a geometrical phase, which detects the principal structural elements, and thence an Adaptive sampling procedure is carried out, which, with the aid of the results of the preceding stage, constructs the proper surface from the sketch. This Adaptive sampling is guided by the operator’s guidance. In this manner the process is completed and the artist has full control of the result. Unlike previous methods, which have relied exclusively on statistical methods, our geometrical sampling procedure enables the model to be reconstructed in an explicit manner, and gives a much more reliable and predictable result. This procedure contributes to the growing field of sketch-based modeling, by offering a procedure which gives good results quickly and with little operator intervention.",
        " This paper introduces the generative cooperative network, which is a new method of image synthesis, which does not rely on the competition of generators and discriminators in a generative adversarial network to achieve high-quality image synthesis and efficient data augmentation. The framework of the GCN is hierarchical, with dedicated structures for the structural preservation, the textural enhancement, and the semantic consistency of the images, and can simulate various images of different categories. Cooperation can also improve the stability of training and avoid the mode collapse of a single generator. The result is that the GCN can achieve 18.7% and 22.3 % improvements in FID over the state-of-the-art methods in the standard benchmarks. And GCN can improve the accuracy of image classification by 4.2% in the confined situation. , especially for those applications that need to combine high-quality image synthesis and efficient data augmentation.",
        " Alignment-based learning (ABL) is a computational framework that can bootstrap structural elements into a language model. Alignment-based learning builds on the idea that the acquisition of a language involves discovering regularities in the distribution of features, without any explicit knowledge. In experiments on several languages, it is shown that ABL is able to learn grammatical categories, phrase structures and dependencies that are very close to linguistic analyses, although no grammatical knowledge is explicitly encoded. The resulting representations not only improve the performance of downstream tasks, but also generalize better to novel constructions compared to supervised methods. ABL is able to detect grammatical tenses and is able to detect inflectional and declinative constructions. This suggests that structural bootstrapping via alignment-based mechanisms is a basic process both in human and in machine learning.",
        " \"Object-based ego-motion estimation with semantic point cloud-based stereo vision for driverless vehicles\" - A method for combining semantic and geometric understanding of the world to determine the position and movement of the vehicle in complex urban environments. We use a deep neural network to train our system on the visual features of the surrounding environment. The system then creates a point cloud which is semantically enhanced. Our method is designed to work in real time on a standard graphic card, running at a speed of 18 fps. The paper contains many experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes data sets, demonstrating that our method is superior to the state of the art in both 3D object tracking and ego-motion estimation, with a 7% average improvement in vehicle detection and a 5.3% improvement in the accuracy of ego-motion estimation compared to existing methods. Semantic and geometric information are combined to improve the accuracy and reliability of perception for driverless navigation.",
        " The artificial intelligence in the manufacture of large series of letters, to be read in order, in an orderly fashion, and under certain certain conditions, is an art. It is not an easy art. In this paper we present Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE), a new deep learning architecture, which is designed for the training of tabular data. This system has the advantages of neural networks and a series of decision trees, but also the advantages of the oblivious decision tree (ODT) and a set of oblivious trees, using a neural network as the neural medium. Our experiments on a wide variety of tabular data show that NODE outperforms both the ODT and the deep learning methods. Its inductive biases for tabular data are preserved, but the end-to-end gradient is learned. The results also show that NODE has better robustness to noise and missing values than alternative methods.",
        " This paper introduces a new approach to blind super-resolution which avoids the shortcomings of existing methods by not requiring any prior knowledge of the degrading process. Rather, our method iteratively refines both the high-resolution image and the unknown blur kernel in a simple yet effective manner. Our method is robust to noise, compression, and to severe blurring which would typically be expected to ruin the results of parametric models. Moreover, the method scales efficiently with image size and is able to operate with very small degrading images. On benchmarks, our method is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods by an average of 2.3 dB of PSNR. The code and the pretrained models are publicly available to stimulate further research in this area. The simplicity of our method, along with its accuracy and robustness, makes it particularly suitable for real-world applications where the degrading process is often unpredictable and varies.",
        " ... It is a most difficult problem to interpret the topological and geometric properties of point-clouds, which, owing to their peculiar structure, have received but a very irregularly interspaced arrangement of points. PointShuffleNet is a new framework for the representation of non-Euclidean topological and geometrical properties of point-clouds by means of homotopy equivalences and mutual information. Our method for the extraction of features by means of homotopy equivalences, together with the information-theoretic learning objectives, are shown to give PointShuffleNet a very strong robustness to un-uniform point-sampling, noise and the effect of occlusion. Experiments show that the learning of a homotopy-aware representation ensures the conservation of local geometrical details and of the global topological structure. PointShuffleNet provides a theoretically motivated framework for the interpretation of non-Euclidean data, while achieving a level of performance suitable for real-time applications.",
        " This paper introduces Deep-PDF, a new probabilistic framework that combines deep learning and a unified approach to solving the surface-optimization problem in terms of a distribution-estimation problem. The surface-optimization problem is thus formulated as a probabilistic-function-estimation problem. Our probabilistic framework has the properties of coping robustly with ambiguous regions and formally analyzing uncertainty, which makes it especially useful in applications of computer vision, graphics, and scientific computing in which the data are sparse or noisy. Experiments on different applications such as shape completion, point cloud processing, and generative modeling show that Deep-PDF outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy, generalization capability, and efficiency.",
        " These lines are in keeping with a proposition which will be subsequently developed in the tract on the ‘general theory of the laws of motion’. We present a complete classification of similarity metrics for Markov decision processes, in order to meet the increasing need for comparison methods in the learning of MDPs and in the theory of decision. We categorize the available metrics according to their mathematical foundations, their computational properties, and their preservation of decision-theoretic structures. Our classification unifies previous, disparate metrics, and provides practical guidance for selecting the appropriate metrics for specific applications. For each metric, we analyze its theoretical guarantees, its computational properties, and its sensitivity to the choice of the MDP's parameterization. This classification not only clarifies the relationships between existing metrics, but also identifies promising directions for the future development of similarity measures that better capture the decision-theoretic essence of MDPs.",
        " - (Note) It was introduced in this paper to handle the task of a new recognition method for the whole of the images. We present a method for improving the representation of a moving image by a method called Temporal Context Aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard retrieval tasks such as MSR-VTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo show that the performance of our method is significantly improved compared to existing methods, and we show that the improved performance is mainly due to the ability of the temporal context aggregation to grasp the complex temporal evolution of the object while preserving efficiency.. We integrated this temporal modeling method in the contrastive learning setting, where the pair of the scene and the text is mapped to a joint embedding space by a dual encoder. Our method not only improves the performance of the scene and text pair comparison, but also reveals the importance of the temporal modeling for the cross-modal scene understanding task.",
        " But scene graph generation is a difficult task. As a result of its complexity, the information density of the available information is so weak that the quality of the relationship is so low that the weak but correct relationships are often not recognized. In this paper, we present a novel framework that solves the problems of the sparsity and long-tail distribution of the available information. The method combines contrastive learning with a bias mechanism to distinguish true negative relationships from unannotated relationships. Extensive experiments on the visual genome show that our method can improve the rare relationship performance by a significant margin without sacrificing overall performance, and our method can achieve the state-of-the-art in all accuracy metrics. . The experiments also show that the system can generate more complete and accurate scene graphs in real-world applications where the completeness of the annotation is not guaranteed.",
        " Single-image depth estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision that remains challenging because of the difficulty in obtaining large quantities of ground-truth depths for real-world scenes. Synthetic data on the other hand can be annotated with precise depths but fail to generalize to real-world images because of the domain gap. In this paper, we propose T2Net (Translation to Realism), an unsupervised domain-generalization method for solving single-image depth estimation. T2Net can learn end-to-end, without the need for a unified dataset or real-world depths, to generalize to any dataset with depths. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods trained on synthetic data alone, and achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods trained on real data with ground truth. Our approach comprises two main components: an image-translation network which translates synthetic images into more realistic-looking ones while preserving their geometric structure, and a depth estimation network which exploits the translated synthetic data in conjunction with unlabeled real data, with a carefully formulated consistency loss. Our implementation and pre-trained models are made available to the research community, to facilitate future research in this area.",
        " Our lane-marking architecture, based on a Dynamic Vision Sensor, exploits the special features of the event-based, asynchronous images of DVS, which are, in contrast to conventional frame-based cameras, triggered by changes in light intensity. These properties are highly advantageous for robust lane-detection in a system of automatic driving. In experiments on publicly available data as well as our own challenging new images, our system outperforms state-of-the-art by 12.7% in F1-score and 18.3% in accuracy, while running in real time (95 fps on standard hardware). Our approach also performs well in a range of lighting conditions, where many other vision systems fail. We have incorporated a structure-aware feature extraction module which is able to capture the geometric properties of lanes through a directional convolution layer and a topology-preserving loss function. The proposed architecture bridges the gap between the neuromorphic vision systems and the neural-based event-driven camera systems in intelligent transportation systems.",

        " A new method of extracting discriminative facial features on several levels is presented in this paper. It is inspired by the fusiform face area of the human brain which is specialized in recognizing faces. It is based on a multi-layer structure, which simultaneously recognizes low-level texture features, mid-level facial components, and high-level overall facial features. It uses a new feature fusion method to recognize the importance of features on different levels according to their discriminative power. The hierarchical feature extraction method can not only improve the performance of automatic facial recognition systems, but also provides a study of the performance of deep learning in the fine-grained visual recognition task. Extensive experiments on LFW, CelebA and CASIA-webface show that FusiformNet can outperform state-of-the-art methods in the tasks of face recognition, facial feature prediction and facial expression analysis.",
        " Meanwhile the limit ot mutual information has been shown, because it fails to explain the metric structure of the data. We introduce the Wasserstein dependency measure, a new representation learning objective that is based on Wasserstein's rule. It is proved that the Wasserstein dependency measure has desirable properties. We provide efficient Wasserstein estimators and apply them to learning representations. Several experiments on synthetic data, image classification, and reinforcement learning tasks show that Wasserstein-based representations outperform representations learned by mutual information and other dependency measures, especially in settings with complex geometric structures or with limited data. The Wasserstein-based method provides a principled alternative to other dependency measures which is geometrically motivated, while being computationally tractable.",
        " The paper presents Text2Video, a novel method for generating talking-head videos from text input. Unlike previous methods that rely on intermediate representations, such as speech, or 3D face models, our method creates a direct mapping from text to a photorealistic talking-head video via a personalized phoneme-pose dictionary. Our experiments show that the resulting videos are realistic and faithfully reproduce the identity and speaking style of the original person. Moreover, we show that our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods on both objective metrics and subjective human evaluations, especially in terms of temporal consistency and naturalness of facial motion. This approach has potential applications in the areas of content creation, accessibility services, and human-computer interaction. In addition, we show that our method can generalize to unknown text inputs, and be fine-tuned with little human supervision for new identities.",
        " SUMMARY OF SURVEY OVERVIEW 3D ultrasonography is a valuable non-invasive modality for clinical diagnosis and image-guided interventions due to its real-time capability, its absence of ionizing radiation, and its relatively low cost. The intrinsic properties of ultrasonic images such as speckle noise, acoustic shadowing, and non-uniformity of image intensities make segmentation particularly challenging. The aim of this paper is to present a systematic and detailed overview of the main methods used for 3D ultrasound image segmentation, with a special emphasis on the available literature. This review covers both the classical methods (region-growing, watershed, active contours, level sets) and the newer ones (convolutional neural networks, U-net variants, and transformer-based models). We also discuss publicly available data, performance metrics, and strategies for their evaluation. This survey is meant to be a useful reference for both clinicians and for those interested in research in 3D ultrasound image analysis. In addition, we highlight open problems and promising future directions.",
        " We introduce a new way of increasing the efficiency of minibatch SGD by a sampling procedure we call ‘typicality sampling’. While minibatch SGD typically selects examples randomly, our method identifies and strategically selects typical examples to reduce variance in gradient estimates, thus reducing the variance in gradient estimates, which in turn reduces the variance of gradient estimates. It is a very lightweight method that can be easily integrated into existing frameworks and makes it easy to combine with other standard procedures. The theoretical results on the progress of convergence are analyzed, and the reduction in training time is evaluated.",
        " This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the pre-training strategies and the datasets that can be used to learn facial representations. It examines the differences between the self-supervised and supervised methods in the way of training, and the accuracy and generalizability of facial representations with respect to various auxiliary tasks. The study covers many architectural designs, loss functions and data augmentation techniques, using the large-scale facial data set, containing more than ten million images of people with various profiles. Finally, it introduces a new curriculum strategy, which progressively increases the complexity of discrimination tasks in pre-training, resulting in representations that capture both the fine-grained identity features and generalizable facial features. The result is that contrastive learning methods with carefully designed facial-specific augmentations outperform traditional supervised methods in face recognition, facial feature prediction and expression recognition tasks. According to our results, we provide practical guidelines for the development of facial representations that combine task performance, speed, and fairness.",
        " The orientation and density of the objects in the scene are an important problem in the field of visual perception. This paper introduces a two-stage detection system, the Dynamic Refinement Net (DRNet), which is able to adapt to the conditions of the scene. In the first stage, a pool of features are extracted, and to deal with the densely packed scene, a non-maximum suppression method is adopted and the occlusion-guided feature enhancement strategy is introduced. Extensive experiments on many different data sets, including DOTA, HRSC2016 and our newly introduced dense orientation dataset, demonstrate that DRNet can achieve significant performance improvements over existing methods. On the densely packed scene, the mAP improves by 3.2%. The proposed method is particularly effective in scenes with arbitrary object orientations and high densities, and it can be applied to the fields of aerial image analysis, industrial inspection and logistics management.",
        " So the question is, what kind of a system will best meet the needs of this requirement? I will explain by way of illustration, and present the following scheme: This scheme consists of two parts: one is an original component, the other is an image processing system, which, with its application, would be used to process the whole image, so that the two together can not only search for a similar image, but also a variety of different rays. This is a significant advancement in hardware acceleration of feature matching algorithms, which can be used as a solution for embedded vision systems with high energy and performance requirements. It can process more than 100,000 descriptor pairs per second, enabling real-time performance for many computer vision applications.",
        " Using Batch Policy Optimization we show how to improve the learning speed of policy optimization, while improving the usefulness of the residual policy learning procedure. Our method combines the merits of both learning procedures and does not require new experiences. Our method is based on residual policy learning, which we developed, a well-known reinforcement learning method. We show that BRPO improves the performance of the methods of standard batch learning in continuous control tasks with very little data. Our work provides a practical framework for policy reshaping in situations where the robot's contact with the environment is too expensive or even impossible. We also show that BRPO is robust to various combinations of data and can be used to exploit the quality of mixed experiences.",
        " This paper deals with the problems of distributed statistical inference for sparse partial linear models in a high-dimensional setting. We propose a novel framework of debiased distributed estimation which allows for the efficient estimation and inference of the parameters of such models on a network of machines. The proposed method combines local debiased estimators with a carefully designed aggregation scheme which is able to preserve the statistical efficiency of the estimators while reducing the computational cost. Using simulations and real-world applications, we show that our method outperforms all previous distributed methods in terms of both estimation accuracy and inference accuracy, while still being computationally efficient. We prove the asymptotic efficiency of the proposed estimator under mild conditions, and show that it converges with a rate of O(p log p) when the dimension of the model grows log-linearly with the sample size. Hence, we show that our method can be used to analyze sparse partial linear data in a distributed setting without sacrificing its statistical efficiency.",
        " Temporal graphs, in which the nodes and edges are both changing over time, present a particular challenge to traditional embedding methods which fail to capture the temporal dynamics and causal dependencies inherent to such structures. We introduce a new representation of temporal graphs based on causal random walks, which solves this problem by allowing causality to be preserved by random walks that follow a random path through the network. Our approach learns a representation which captures both topological and temporal information through a careful sampling strategy and a learning framework. Extensive experiments on several real-world temporal networks, including communication, transportation and social interaction networks, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods on a wide range of tasks, including node classification, link prediction and temporal community detection. We extend the concept of anonymous walks to the temporal domain, enabling us to capture topological structure while preserving both the temporal dynamics of the network and the anonymity of its nodes. TGCAW-RW is a fast and interpretable representation of dynamic networks, which preserves the causal constraints inherent to temporal data. We also give theoretical guarantees on the expressiveness of our representation with respect to temporal graph isomorphism.",

        " ZERO-SHOT INSTANCE SEGMENTATION Zero-shot instance segmentation, the task of detecting and delineating each of the individual objects of interest in a given image, has hitherto been performed with the aid of a large annotated data-set. In this paper, we propose a new zero-shot instance segmentation (ZSIS) method which eliminates the need for instance-level annotated data by associating visual features and the latent description of the objects in a shared latent space. Our method uses contrastive learning to associate the visual features with the latent description, thereby retaining the spatial information necessary for accurate masking. We show, through extensive experiments on challenging data-sets including the COCO and the ADE20K, that our method performs significantly better than the existing zero-shot approaches, obtaining masks with an accuracy up to 24% better than theirs for unseen object categories. Our method is an important step towards more flexible visual systems that can detect and segment novel objects in images without annotating them exhaustively. In addition, we present a detailed analysis of the trade-off between the generalization performance and the masking accuracy.",
        " The evaluation of GANs has been difficult, as the methods for evaluating them have not been sufficiently standardized. In this paper we propose a new evaluation framework which is designed to overcome the limitations of existing evaluation methods by combining qualitative assessment with quantitative measurements in a structured, reproducible way. The framework consists of three main innovations: firstly, it is multifaceted, that is, it combines several quality metrics to compare samples; secondly, it is application-dependent, and the choice of criteria is based on the demands of the application; and thirdly, a performance analysis of the efficiency of training. We provide an open source implementation of the framework, which will help to standardize the comparison of GANs and stimulate the development of this technique. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets and GAN architectures show that this framework provides a more consistent ranking of generative models than existing evaluation methods and a closer relationship with human judgment.",
        " These ___________ were actually the letters of the alphabet, and these ____ were the letters of the alphabet. ____ Edge-Similar Graph Neural Networks Graph neural networks have been introduced as powerful tools for learning on graphs. But they have been hitherto mainly concerned with the topological structure of the graph, and have neglected the semantic interrelations between the edges. In this paper, we propose a method which explicitly considers the similarity of the edges, thus allowing the propagation of more subtle information. We show, through extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark data, that edge-similar graph neural networks can improve performance over existing models on tasks ranging from node labelling to the classification of entire graphs. We show by decomposition studies that the similarity of the edges contributes substantially to the generalization power of the network. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a principled framework for learning graph representations which retains the efficiency of the original neural network.",
        " Unlike previous methods, which depended on a separate model for each modality, or a complex fusion method, TxT operates on raw inputs of several modalities simultaneously and learns joint representations from shared attention layers. It is found to be more efficient and to be a general framework for multimodal applications. A comprehensive study on several multimodal datasets demonstrates the superiority of TxT over previous methods on all the experiments.",
        " \"In recent years, graph neural networks have shown remarkable performance in various graph-based learning tasks. The success of GNNs has been attributed to homophily, the tendency of the neighboring nodes to share similar features or labels. This paper critically examines whether homophily is a necessary condition for GNN performance. The study shows that the success of GNNs is not due to homophily itself, but is due to the ability to learn appropriate feature transformations and local aggregation strategies according to the graph properties. \" Through experiments on real heterophilic graphs, we also show that GNNs with carefully designed architectures can achieve a high level of performance, even under extremely violated homophily conditions. At the same time, we also introduce a novel heterophily-insensitive GNN structure that automatically adapts to different homophily levels without any knowledge of the graph structure.. \"",
        " Their main characteristics are that they are capable of displaying both hierarchical and similarity relationships. Their main characteristic is that they are able to represent their whole self-similarity in a single shot. All these can be seen by the fact that they allow the location of the centroids of these fractals at a known distance from the centroids. In the paper, we describe the novel method of complex hyperbolic space for representing hierarchical data, which significantly outperforms both Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings, especially for hierarchies with complex branching. We present specialized learning methods that respect the geometry of complex hyperbolic space and allow stable training. Our work opens up new possibilities for geometric representation learning by establishing complex hyperbolic geometry as a powerful framework for modelling hierarchical data. The proposed method is capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance on a large scale of hierarchical data.",
        " This paper introduces the DN-DFNet, a novel deep learning architecture that can capture both local and global geometric structures from point cloud data, and simultaneously address the inherent challenges of point cloud data—namely, their sparseness, their irregularity, and their lack of permutation invariance—by simultaneously relying on two complementary neighborhoods at different scales. The DN-DFNet creates two parallel neighborhoods with different radii, one spherical neighborhood which preserves local geometric details and a semantic neighborhood based on semantic information. Our main contribution is an automatic weight update and fusion of the two neighborhoods that determines their relative importance based on the local and global scales. Our experiments show that the DN-DFNet outperforms state-of-the-art results in classifying objects, segmenting them into parts, and inferring their semantics. It is especially effective for capturing complex scenes with varying point densities and boundaries. The proposed architecture can be applied to many applications, including 3D scene understanding, robot navigation, and augmented reality. Moreover, feature amputation experiments demonstrate that the dual-neighborhood mechanism is highly effective at capturing a richer set of features than single-neighborhood approaches, while at the same time maintaining good performance.",
        " This paper proposes a Spectral-Spatial Graph Reasoning (SSGR) network for hyperspectral image classification, which effectively exploits the spectral and spatial information by means of graph-based reasoning. Adaptive fusion of information based on the relative importance of the two domains was introduced, and a performance improvement of 2.3% to 4.1% was obtained. The results of our experiments on the four standard spectral images from the Salinas, Indian Pines, Pavia and Salinas datasets show that our SSGR method is superior to that of the other two methods, while its running time is also small. Moreover, it is more robust to the small training samples, indicating that it has a high potential for practical applications in remote sensing.",
        " The paper presents a new geometric active-learning approach to image segmentation, both in a bi-class and a multi-class setting. The framework uses the geometric properties of the boundaries between regions of interest to select the most informative samples for labeling, thereby reducing the labeling cost while maintaining high accuracy. The proposed method is architecture-independent and can be integrated with different deep learning models. Through extensive experiments on various public datasets, including PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes and medical images, it is shown that the geometric sampling strategy can achieve similar accuracy as random sampling with up to 60% fewer labeled samples. The experimental results are in good agreement with the geometry-based active learning framework, confirming that the geometric sampling strategy is able to complement traditional measures of uncertainty, and thereby providing an effective tool to alleviate the labeling bottleneck.",
        " These results are reported in a system that is called CM3. The problem of this system is to deal with the more complex cooperative multi-agent tasks requiring the achievement of multiple goals over distinct stages, which have been found difficult to solve using previous multi-agent reinforcement learning methods. The system overcomes these difficulties by a hierarchical decomposition of the task into manageable sub-problems, while still preserving the coherence of the collective behavior. This is achieved by a staged reward function that provides the agents with appropriate rewards for their actions and for the achievement of long-term goals. Extensive experiments on diverse cooperative tasks, such as resource allocation, cooperative building and strategic games, show that CM3 outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate, agent cooperation and adaptability to changing task requirements. It is a promising approach for the scalability of cooperative multi-agent systems towards the more complex real-world tasks that require the achievement of multiple goals over distinct stages. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the performance of CM3 can be up to 45 % better than that of state-of-the-art methods, especially in those situations where the agents must make complex sequential decisions.",
        " Deep learning excels at learning complex patterns, but is less efficient in learning sparse feature interactions, which are naturally represented by logical rules. We develop a framework to overcome this difficulty, by encoding rule-like interactions in neural networks. The resulting network encodes both the interpretability of rules and the continuous training of neural networks. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data sets show that neural rule encoders outperform both standard neural networks and rule-based methods, especially in cases where sparse interactions are prevalent. Our method thus provides a promising direction for developing models that combine good performance with human-understandable decision logic. In addition, the resulting models maintain a certain interpretability by revealing the learned rules and their contributions to the prediction.",
        " 3D Multi-Object Tracking: A Benchmark and New Metrics. This paper deals with a critical and little investigated aspect of robot vision, that is the task of 3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT). The transition from 2D to 3D introduces a new dimension to the problems of multi-object tracking, resulting in the need for new metrics and evaluation measures. In this paper we propose new metrics that capture the spatial accuracy of the trajectories in 3D, and correct the deficiencies of the metrics previously used in the evaluation of 2D MOT. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScene datasets show the superiority of the proposed metrics. The metrics proposed here can be used as a basis for future work in 3D MOT by providing a suitable ground truth.",
        " This paper addresses the problem of enhancing the transferability of deep neural networks across different tasks and domains. Although deep neural networks have achieved great successes in their specialized task, they have difficulty generalizing to other tasks, thereby limiting their practical use. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to enhancing transferability by three complementary methods: a combination of modifications to the architecture, improvements in the learning method, and a supervised learning method. The three methods have been thoroughly tested on a wide range of tasks, including computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-modality tasks, and the results show that our method can significantly improve the performance of traditional transfer learning, requiring less than 75 percent of the data from the target task, and the performance is comparable. The modifications to the architecture include a set of separated layers to separate the domain-dependent features from the domain-invariant features, and a learning method that gradually enhances the domain-invariant features while retaining the task-discrimination power. The supervised learning method uses self-supervised learning to force the underlying network to produce features that can generalize from the local task to the general task. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the relationship between transferability and specialization, and prove that the transferability is within a certain range.",
        " We present a new, deeper learning network, called Multiresolution Convolutional Autoencoders (MCA), which integrates within the autoencoder framework the principles of multiresolution analysis. It has specialized encoding layers which extract the information at various resolutions, then a fusion mechanism which combines them before a decoding stage. The multiresolution strategy is particularly effective in extracting fine details as well as global structures, and this has been shown to give a 15% improvement in PSNR at the reconstruction stage, and a significant improvement in downstream tasks when used for representation learning. Finally, we show that the learned multiresolution representations generalize better than single resolution representations, when they are used for unsupervised tasks. On diverse datasets, natural images, medical images and satellite images, we have found that MCAs outperform single resolution autoencoders for image reconstruction, feature extraction and denoising tasks. This research opens a promising direction for representation learning, where scale-space information is efficiently exploited by architecture.",
        " Of Stein's identity, which enables one to calculate the gradient of the inverse and differential of a state, we propose a reduction of the variance of the gradient by means of an adaptation of the algebraic basis by a derivative of the action functions. Theoretically, under certain conditions, the calculation of the slope is definitely reduced, while the direction of the maximum is unbiased. The use of Stein's identity provides an automatic generation of zero-mean control variates tailored to the state space of a particular policy without requiring further estimation of the value functions.. The action-dependent nature of the control variates makes them particularly suitable for policies with complex action distributions, and may lead to the development of new, more effective methods of policy adjustment.",
        " Through the adapted method of this paper the problems of fairness and discrimination are dealt with in a fair way. The new method is an improvement on the Hoeffding method, which, without pre-treatments, it applies directly to the learning process. It employs a method of “outer information,” a criterion which, by penalizing discriminatory branchings, is the most exact method to apply to data, or else it can be post-treated by some rule. The experiment shows that this method has successfully reduced discrimination by an average of 43% compared with Hoeffding Trees, while at the same time it has had little effect on the general accuracy of the classification, causing only a drop of 0.3%. In the experiments it also showed that it has better efficiency than other fairness-aware classifiers, thereby making it very suitable for real-time applications. Then, too, the new method dynamically adapts to the changing nature of the data in a stream of data, and still keeps the fairness guarantee. The paper also contains a theoretical guarantee on the convergence properties of our splitting criterion, and analyzes the trade-offs between different fairness metrics in various applications.",
        " This chapter introduces ASM, a novel learning method combining the power of ARMA with that of score-based learning methods. ASM combines the advantages of ARMA with those of score-based generative models, in that, unlike them, it uses autoregressive decomposition of the score function, thereby achieving more efficient and more accurate density estimation in high dimensional spaces. ASM is a promising approach to generative modeling that balances computational efficiency and expressive power. In image, sound, and text generation experiments, ASM produces samples with superior quality to those obtained from diffusion models, while providing faster sampling than those obtained from the ARMA. ASM also outperforms score-based and autoregressive approaches on several different data sets.",
        " Using a recent paper as a starting point, we introduce BSGANs, a method which has a different objective from previous methods. Unlike previous methods which used gradients which may vanish where the discriminator has confidence, the objective of BSGANs is to optimize samples on the discriminator decision boundary between the real and the simulated data. This approach can be shown to minimize the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the generator and the discriminator distribution. BSGANs experiments show superior performance over the state-of-the-art in terms of stability of training, reduced mode collapse and superior generative power. In addition, our method is compatible with existing architectures and regularizations, which makes it a very general extension of the GAN framework.",
        " Full-Duplex VOS is a strategy for full-duplex information flow in object segmentation. Unlike conventional one-way propagation from past to current frame, the proposed system simultaneously propagates features from future and past frame through the specially designed cross-temporal attention modules. And it can overcome the difficulties of occlusions, deformations and changes of appearances. We also show through a number of omission experiments that full-duplex information propagation not only reduces error accumulation in temporal consistency but also enables consistent temporal representations. On the DAVIS16, DAVIS17 and YouTube-VOS datasets, the system achieves an average score improvement of 3.2%, 2.8% and 2.5%, respectively, over the state-of-the-art methods. In summary, the proposed method offers a robust and accurate framework for temporally consistent object segmentation.",
        " “In this paper we introduce Fed-TGAN, a federated framework for the synthesis of tabular data. The existing approaches to generating tabular data, which require a centralized collection of data, raise significant privacy concerns in certain domains, such as medicine or finance. Without exchanging the data, the federation allows several organizations to train a generative adversarial network, which can produce tabular data. Using a novel secure aggregation protocol, the synthetic data generated by Fed-TGAN preserves complex relationships between features, and achieves fidelity scores close to those of centralized approaches, while ensuring formal privacy guarantees. The experimentation on several real-world datasets demonstrates that Fed-TGAN produces synthetic data with statistical properties that are similar to the distributed data, while also being useful for subsequent machine learning. We propose Fed-TGAN as a privacy-preserving solution for the synthesis of tabular data in regulated industries, where the exchange of data is restricted by law or by professional ethics.",
        " This paper introduces a novel framework for inverse reinforcement learning, which employs the direct estimates of policy to constrain the search space for the reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a method for inferring the reward function of an agent by observing an expert's performance on an existing policy. However, these methods often suffer from the problem of ambiguity, and they often suffer from the computational cost of solving a very large class of possible reward functions. We theoretically prove the validity of our method, and show that it can achieve up to a 40 % increase in the recovery accuracy of the reward function, and a 30 % reduction in the search space and execution time of the previous IRL method, and can still achieve good performance under noisy data. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method, and then experimentally test its performance in various continuous control environments, where the data from the demonstration is sparse. In addition, this method can also be more accurate in the presence of noisy data. , can lead to more efficient and accurate inverse reinforcement learning.",
        " A new approach to semantic segmentation of polarimetric SAR images, based on the integration of three-dimensional discrete wavelet transform and Markov random field modeling, is presented. Polarimetric SAR images have a wealth of scattering information, but also present a great challenge because of speckle noise and the complexity of the scattering mechanisms. The method combines the power of 3D-DWT to efficiently decompose the PolSAR image into different scales and orientations while preserving the polarimetric information. The wavelet coefficients can be used as local texture features, and the Markov random field can be used to model the local spatial coherence of the surrounding regions, thus enhancing the overall segmentation accuracy. The MRF is solved using graph cuts to efficiently determine the best-fit class labels. The proposed method obtains a better accuracy of 4.3% and 3.8% than existing methods, and its average intersection-over-union ratio is 0.38 less than that of existing methods. It also achieves a better ratio of enclosing areas. The method can be used in future work to model polarimetric information in PolSAR image interpretation.",
        " The paper proposes a new strategy for cooperative LIDAR-based object detection in a multi-agent system. Although cooperative perception leads to significantly enhanced performance, in terms of the available bandwidth, the agents can no longer share all the data collected from the sensors. The proposed framework dynamically adapts the granularity and number of features shared, depending on the available network bandwidth, network conditions, and scene complexity. In extensive experiments on the V2X-Sim and OPV2V data sets, the authors show that their approach achieves significant reductions in data sharing, with a maximum of a 33% reduction in the number of features shared. Our system also performs well with different kinds of network conditions, from high capacity to high mobility. We have addressed an important bottleneck in cooperative perception, that of efficiently sharing information under severe limitations in communication resources. The proposed framework outperforms static compression methods by dynamically adjusting the granularity and number of features shared, and is thus particularly suitable for dynamic situations such as the rapid, on-the-fly adjustment of available communication resources in dynamic, on-the-fly adaptation of communication resources.",
        " The main idea of the paper is that of combining the intrinsic curiosity of an agent with the ability to use a human-interpretable sub-goal, which is also useful in a sparse environment, but also in a black box. 37% increases in sample efficiency and 42% increases in task success in sparse environments compared to naive curiosity. Our approach is based on using semantic information from the environment to generate subgoals that are both useful for exploration and meaningful to humans. Through extensive experiments on diverse environments, including Atari games, robots, and worlds created by a process, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art curiosity-driven methods while providing human-understandable explanations of learned policies. This paper is an important step towards creating learning systems that are both efficient and transparent. We also present human studies that show that generating these subgoals substantially increases the human understanding of the process and the trust in the agent's decisions.",
        " SUMMARY: This paper presents a new strategy for the selection of nodes for learning in networks that is based on graph centrality. This new approach exploits centrality measures to identify the most influential nodes in a network and provides a more representative and more informative training set. Testing on various large-scale datasets in different application areas (bibliometric, social, and molecular graphs) shows that the proposed strategy requires up to 40% less nodes than random sampling while performing as well or better than the random samplers. We also show that the proposed strategy is especially effective in the presence of missing data and therefore is a good candidate for semi-supervised learning. Our results suggest that structural properties of the network can be used to optimize node selection in learning tasks. The proposed method is very efficient: the computation of centrality is accelerated using an efficient approximation scheme, and thus the learning process is also accelerated.",
        " Occurrences, on the contrary, are separated in distinct objects, each one of which is extended by the network as it grows by a flood-filling mechanism. The network focuses on a given seed point, then fills in successively a series of contiguous points by analyzing their local context and predicting the probability of each cell to be included. The network, able to use both local and global information, would be particularly adapted to other biological or medical images where precise separation of the different objects is required in complex, overcrowded situations. The experiments on the data of brain tissue observed by the microscope show that this method significantly improves previous methods, decreasing the errors by more than thirty percent and achieving, for the first time, an accuracy of more than 0.9 in the automatic extraction of the neural membranes. This approach allows FNNs to recognize fine boundary patterns and to precisely separate the objects located near each other, which is of particular importance in the difficult field of connectomics and neural wiring.",
        " With the help of a mutual shared space, where the disparity representations of different images can be placed, the result is a much more accurate view of the scene, even with a limited number of images, or with an imprecise and sometimes distorted depth map. This paper presents a new framework of multi-mode-depth learning, called Coupled Depth Learning (CDL), which simultaneously learns the disparity representations of different modalities, while preserving the inherent correlations between them. This framework simultaneously learns the disparity distributions of all images, including the stereo images, for monocular depth estimation, stereo matching, and depth completion. This approach not only significantly improves the depth estimation accuracy, but also gives us insight into how different disparity distributions can be effectively combined. The experiments show that, by a significant improvement in depth estimation accuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art single-mode methods, the learned multi-mode representations are effective in auxiliary tasks, such as object detection and scene understanding.",
        " \"The term is of African origin.\" Structural from motion is a fundamental problem in computer vision, consisting in reconstructing three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional image sequences. This paper revisits the two-view SfM problem through the perspective of deep learning and aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods. The method is based on classical geometric constraints combined with a modern neural network architecture, in order to increase the accuracy and robustness in challenging cases. Our extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that our method outperforms both traditional methods and previous deep learning solutions, especially in scenes with repetitive patterns, areas without textures, and extreme viewpoint changes. Our disassembly studies demonstrate the importance of including geometric priors into the network architecture. We propose a novel end-to-end trainable framework that jointly estimates the camera poses and depth maps from the image pairs, without requiring any explicit feature matching as an intermediate step. Our method is fast enough for real-time applications, and the superior performance makes it well suited for augmented reality, 3D reconstruction, and navigation.",
        " We present a new framework for salient object detection which combines attention mechanisms and multi-level supervision. Our framework features two key innovations: a Cross-Level Attention Module (CLAM) which dynamically associates high-level semantic features with low-level spatial features for more comprehensive feature representation; and a Multi-level Supervision Scheme (MLSS) which provides explicit guidance at each decoding stage for improving localization accuracy and spatial consistency. The framework is not only effective for saliency detection, but also a promising approach for densely supervised learning. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements in F-measure (1.8%) and precision (1.1%) over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, an a priori analysis of the relevance of each high-level feature and low-level feature shows that they complement each other in providing both high-level context and low-level detail.",
        " Classical TTS systems face many challenges such as confidentiality of sensitive voice data when used to train models, and large amounts of computational power in a centralized environment. We address these issues by enabling the training of models distributed over client devices, while keeping sensitive voice data local. Our proposed framework can be used for text-to-speech synthesis by combining federated learning with a dynamic transformer architecture. Tests on 500 client devices of various sizes and speech patterns showed that federated learning provided an average model quality of 4.3 on a scale of 4.2 (without any communication overhead). The dynamic transformer component achieved a 35% reduction in latency on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing voice quality. Our work enables a flexible and scalable solution to this problem by ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive voice data, while accommodating various device types.",
        " The present work describes a new technique of classifying transient disturbances in power systems based on a two-dimensional representation of PMU data, with the help of a deep learning technique. The multivariate data of the PMU are transformed into a two-dimensional image that preserves the time variability and the phases of the waveforms. We have developed a novel image-based PMU data representation method, which represents the PMU signals as the intensity, phase, and frequency measurements as three separate colors in the red, green, and blue dimensions, with the aim of identifying the features of the waveforms. The image-based method gives higher classification accuracy than the conventional time-series method. The proposed method can accurately classify similar disturbances that are misclassified by conventional methods. This work opens up the possibility of combining machine learning with computer vision to enable the classification of disturbances in real time. Moreover, the visual evaluation of the data shows that the proposed CNN model successfully identifies distinctive visual patterns that correspond to each disturbance signature.",
        " ‘Edge and cloud devices offer the low-latency necessary for real-time applications, but are unable to cope with more complex situations due to the limitations of their computing resources. On the other hand, cloud resources are able to offer high-computational resources but with the addition of network latency. We propose a new approach to object detection that exploits the complementary strengths of edge and cloud devices, through the framework of a difficult-case discriminator.’ ‘The system efficiently and intelligently distributes the computational burden between the cloud and the edge, using a lightweight difficult-case discriminator which is able to determine which cases are difficult and require additional processing. Using a confidence metric and spatial context analysis, the discriminator selectively identifies only difficult cases for cloud resources, while independently coping with standard cases on the edge. In extensive experiments on multiple data sets, the approach has been shown to reduce the end-to-end latency by an average of 37% while maintaining a level of detection accuracy comparable to cloud-only solutions.’ ‘The system dynamically adapts to network conditions and the workload of individual tasks, making it a particularly good choice for resource-constrained IoT deployments and time-sensitive applications such as self-driving vehicles or smart surveillance systems. In addition, our method reduces the data transferred over the network by 62% compared to naive offloading strategies.’",
        " ... This paper is concerned with the problem of the solution of large-scale regularized problems, such as sparse regression, compressed sensing and feature selection. Although the speed of coordinate descent (CD) methods has been well-established in such cases, they suffer from poor scaling properties at high dimensions. We propose a novel scaling framework for CD which overcomes these problems through three innovations: (1) a screening rule which safely eliminates inactive variables, (2) a working set strategy which selects a set of feasible update points from the set of feasible update points, and (3) a parallelization scheme that takes advantage of the machine’s many cores while maintaining convergence. The proposed framework generalizes to other structured regularizers and provides a practical solution to high-dimensional problems in big data applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale data with millions of features show that the proposed method is able to scale to millions of features while maintaining solution quality. Theoretical analysis shows that our method has a complexity of O(n log d ) instead of O(nd log d) for standard CD, where n is the number of features, d is the dimension and  is the desired error.",
        " This paper introduces a novel image segmentation method, the falling ball method (FBA), which conceives of image segmentation as a physical simulation of the movement of falling balls in an image landscape. In the FBA, virtual balls of adjustable radius are released from different seed points, and with the simulation of gravity and the information of the image gradient, the balls fall freely and finally settle at the edges of the objects, thereby partitioning the image into semantically meaningful regions. Experimental results on the BSDS-500 and Pascal-VOC datasets show that our method achieves competitive performance against other state-of-the-art methods, and is especially good at dealing with complex shapes with uneven textures. The FBA is shown to have higher boundary fidelity, improving the accuracy of the boundaries by a factor of 12%, and also has superior stability to the initialization. We introduce some key innovations, such as the local adjustment of the ball radius based on the complexity of the texture, and the exploitation of momentum to overcome the noise. The intuitive physical model provides a basis for semi-supervised learning.",
        " When I was a boy, my mother used to tell me I had blue eyes. I tried to get the drudgery out of my way and sometimes it did get done, and we managed to work it off. If you really have to make a choice, you should at least go for the profession. When it is so very cold and you can't see anything through your shoes, then the most important thing is to work the water and the drudgery out of your way and to have it off your back. These findings offer a promising direction for developing VQA systems that can adapt more effectively to visual contexts.",
        " With the complexity of multimodal data from different domains such as medicine, remote sensing, and digital media, the problems of classifying them by means of the old rules of machine learning become more and more insurmountable. In this article, we propose a novel method which is able to overcome these difficulties. We adapt the dimensionality reduction coefficients according to the characteristics of the data and the learning goals. The method is based on a hierarchical architecture which involves a large number of basic learning processes trained on different modalities, combined with a meta-learning process which combines their results. In our experiments on several standard data sets, our method shows an accuracy increase of 8–12 %, a reduction of the learning time of 35%, and a superiority in generalization of the model to new data in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that the solution of the problem of multivariate dimensionality reduction provides an important link between the complex structure of multimodal data and the successful application of ensemble and transfer learning methods.",
        " ‘Captioning systems have improved their performance significantly in recent years but still lack transparency as to how visual information is interpreted to generate text. This paper presents a new approach to captioning images which uses spatial attention as an interpretable bridge between the visual and the linguistic models. Our experiments show that our method not only improves performance in the standard metrics on the COCO and Flicker30k datasets, but also makes captioning systems more explainable and controllable, which could be useful for applications from augmented vision to content creation. Using attention as a predictor not only improves the performance of the model but also makes it easier for a human captioner to understand and control the system.",
        " The precise classification of medical records is important for clinical decision-support, research and health administration, but it is difficult to achieve because of a lack of labelled data, a specialised medical vocabulary and the requirement for fine-grained classification. In this paper, we describe a semi-supervised learning approach for fine-grained classification of medical records. In experiments on three medical report data sets (radiology reports, pathology reports and discharge summaries), we show that our method improves on fully supervised learning by 7–12% on the F1-score while using only 30–50% of the labelled data. Our method combines pre-trained models of clinical language with a teacher–student learning method, which enhances the classification accuracy by regularising the predictions using consistency constraints and by pseudo-labels. Our experiments suggest that semi-supervised learning offers a promising way to build accurate and resource-efficient systems for classification of medical records in clinical settings. Moreover, our model shows improved performance on rare diagnoses and gives attention weights with a clinical interpretation.",
        " Our guiding idea is that attention is a dynamic resource-allocation process that optimizes the efficiency of information processing under the constraint of a finite capacity. Our theory introduces a general attention operator that maps signal spaces to weighted representations, and that is subject to a set of axioms pertaining to selectivity, capacity-limitation, and context-dependence. We use rigorous mathematical analysis to determine theoretical limits on the capacity and efficiency of attentional processing, establishing fundamental trade-offs between breadth and depth of processing. Empirical evaluations of our framework against both biological and artificial systems show that it makes accurate predictions of attentional behavior under a wide variety of different demands on processing resources. We develop metrics to characterize attentional efficiency, and show that this formalism unifies different attentional mechanisms, ranging from human visual selective attention to self-attention in recurrent neural networks. In the end, we conclude that attention is a fundamental computational mechanism with deep implications for cognition, neural processing, and artificial intelligence.",
        " Object tracking is an important task in computer vision with applications from surveillance to the control of a vehicle. This paper presents a novel approach to multiple object tracking, where the objects are represented as points, the center of their bounding box. The method we present, called center-tracking, detects the center in each frame, and it associates the center of the next frame with the current frame using a learned displacement prediction. Our approach is based on a single convolutional network which predicts the center of two consecutive frames. It can also predict the size and identity of objects and their displacements. In the experiments on several tracking tasks, this simple representation does not require conventional components such as object proposals, separate detection and association models, and complicated post-processing. The simplicity and effectiveness of our method suggest that there is no need for a complex framework, if a detection representation is well designed. Our method achieves a 67.3% MOT score on the MOT-2017 task and runs at 30 FPS.",
        " How to Combine the Means of Classifying Images with the Means of Making Them Display Properly This paper proposes a method of classifying images, which makes use of the information provided by convolutional neural networks. It then goes on to present a new scheme for rearranging images in the midst of a scene to give them a hierarchical structure according to their content. Having devised this means, it is necessary to discuss the means of presenting images in the right way, which has also been experimented with and tested. The result of the experiments, on a number of image data sets, shows that the results are better than those of the conventional one-size-fits-all method. These results are then used in a context-aware encoding and rendering scheme which enables images to be displayed as required by their specific content and context. It is hoped that this work will contribute to the development of intelligent image systems, with applications to digital publishing, content delivery systems, and computational photography.",
        " Normalized flows have become a powerful means of representing complex probability distributions by a sequence of invertible transformations. However, they have so far been restricted to a set of functions of equal dimension. This paper introduces a novel framework for normalized flows that operate freely in arbitrary dimensions. This is based on carefully designed projection and expansion operations that guarantee invertibility and tractability. Our framework, termed Cross-Dimensional Normalizing Flows, enables a higher degree of freedom in the normalization of distributions. It is evaluated on a wide variety of synthetic and real-world data sets, and shows superior performance on manifold learning, generative modeling of heterogeneous data, and multi-resolution analysis. We further demonstrate that it opens the way to previously inaccessible problems where flexibility in arbitrary dimensions is of paramount importance.",
        " The paper explores the complex relationship between the development of machine learning and the status of realism in contemporary philosophy. We discuss how the capacity of machine learning to create, manipulate, and interpret representations fundamentally alters the epistemic principles that have historically supported philosophical realism. In this context, we argue for a ‘computational realism’ that acknowledges both the enhancement potential of machine learning and its capacity to destabilize the value of established truth claims. The paper offers examples from vision, language, and generative modelling to show how these systems at once increase our access to reality and make it problematic. They detect patterns that humans are blind to, while at the same time creating new forms of epistemic opacity.",
        " This paper investigates the convergence properties of projective simulation, a physical model of learning, when applied to Markov decision processes. Although projective simulation has demonstrated promising empirical results in various domains, its theoretical convergence guarantees are largely unknown. We provide a rigorous mathematical analysis of the dynamics of the projective simulator for a finite MDP, establishing sufficient conditions for convergence to the optimal policy. We show that under appropriate choice of exploration schedules and the values of the simulator's state-action differential equations, projective simulation converges with probability one to the optimal policy of the finite MDP. Moreover, we prove upper bounds on the convergence rate, whose value depends on the structure of the MDP and the particular parameterization of the projective simulator. These results both strengthen the theoretical foundations of projective simulation and suggest guidelines for parameter tuning in practical applications. A large set of numerical experiments in a range of standard MDP settings provides experimental support for our analysis.",
        " Our approach is a self-supervised learning framework that relies on the intrinsic structure of documents to learn meaningful representations. This framework involves a multi-task pre-training approach that combines 1) a document-layout prediction objective, 2) a text-image alignment mechanism and 3) a contrastive learning component that is based on image-text correspondence. Our approach bridges the gap between computer vision and natural language processing for document analysis, offering a scalable solution to the annotation bottleneck in document analysis tasks where labelled data is scarce but unlabelled documents are abundant. The learned representations are effective for diverse document understanding tasks, including classification, visual question answering and information extraction. Experiments on three different datasets (RVL-CDIP, DocVQA and FUNSD) show that when the learned representations are fine-tuned with limited amounts of labeled data, the amount of labelling required is reduced by up to 70%.",
        " This article examines the deterioration of the distinction between real and artificial faces in the eyes of humans as the progress of the art of artificial intelligence and computer graphics blurs the limits of visual perception. A series of experiments with 240 participants were carried out to explore how people discriminate between faces taken from photographs and faces generated by state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks. The results show that people’s accuracy in discriminating between the two types of faces was 58.3%, only slightly higher than chance, with a significant tendency to misclassify the artificial faces as real (false-positive rate 48.2%). We found that certain artificial faces were often considered to be more realistic than the real ones. Interestingly, certain artificial faces were considered to be more real than the real ones. The most frequently misclassified faces were those that were symmetrical, had realistic-looking skin, and asymmetric lighting. These results have important implications for digital media literacy, identity verification systems, and our understanding of human visual cognition in the context of an increasingly artificially enriched visual world.",

It was found that a new knowledge was given to the experts, and that this made the judgments of the experts more uniform and the teaching of the apprentices more effective. The method of reasoning is extended by an interpretation.

        " Name: Implicit kernel attention; this paper presents a method of modelling attention as an implicit kernel function in the feature space. The advantages are: (1) Its relationships with the other models; (2) Its relations with the whole data; (3) it represents the modelled attention in the higher dimensions of the feature space; (4) it avoids the quadratic complexity of the calculation of the attention function; and (5) It avoids the appearance of a slanting diagonal in the attention function. It scales well for sequences of thousands of tokens, opening up the possibility of implementing attention-based models with long-term and high-resolution contexts. Through the theoretical analysis, it is shown that IKA generalizes the existing attention functions and gives a unification of attention mechanisms by means of kernel functions.",

        " We have observed that, when we apply an instance segmentation method to a set of images, the samples used for training and inference often differ, and that this difference deteriorates the result. We introduce a new method, SCNet (Sample Consistency Net), which ensures consistency between the training and the inference samples of instance segmentation models. In a dual-path architecture, SCNet simultaneously processes both the augmented training samples and the inference samples, and minimizes the difference between them through the consistency loss. We have applied this method to the COCO and Cityscapes datasets and found that it significantly improves the average precision of COCO and Cityscapes with respect to state-of-the-art methods. Not only does SCNet improve the accuracy of instance segmentation, but it also makes the model more robust to changes in the distribution of the data between the training and inference samples. Moreover, ablation experiments have shown that the method is model-independent, and can be applied to any instance segmentation method with minimal computation cost.",
        " It has come to our attention that in the GNNs it is a serious matter to have a good basis for their extraction, a good basis for the extraction of the logical connections of the graph. The best way to give them a good basis is by means of poolings, which it is possible to do in an effective manner, by a proper selection of the GNN components, in such a manner that the inherent logical connections of the graph are more effectively extracted. We have therefore devised a system of discovery, known as the PAS system, which discovers the optimum pooling strategy of a GNN by means of a directed search for the objective of discovering the optimum pooling strategy of a GNN. Using a differential search space, it involves all types of pooling operations, such as those based on the topology, the features, and a combination of the two. Using a bilevel search for the optimization of the pooling and GNN parameters, we provide task-appropriate adaptation. Extensive experiments on data from the chemistry of molecules, the social networks, and the structures of the structures of the polymers, we have shown that this discovery method shows consistently better results than the known methods of poolings. Moreover, it reduces the burden of the manual preparation of the design of the GNNs, which makes it a promising direction for the automation of graph learning. The patterns of the discovered architectures, which can be found in them in various domains, were analyzed. These provide insights into the relationship between the properties of the graph and the effective poolings.",
        " Objectness score and detection proposals in forward-looking sonar images using convolutional neural networks. Underwater object detection presents unique challenges because of acoustic image distortions, various seafloor conditions, and low SNR. In this paper, we present a framework for assessing the probability of object presence in the image regions, which enables efficient generation of high-quality detection proposals. Experimental results on the widely available data set of forward-looking sonar images demonstrate that the proposed system performs well in various conditions and object types, and can be used for the control of underwater vehicles. Our method uses two stages of convolutional neural networks: the first stage extracts the features tailored for the characteristics of acoustic images, and the second stage classifies and refines object regions. This work advances the state-of-the-art of underwater object detection and provides a foundation for a high degree of autonomy in underwater robots. In addition, we provide detailed analysis of the computational requirements to facilitate implementation on platforms with limited processing power.",

        " Neural networks are now employed for a large number of visual tasks, such as the recognition of features and objects, object recognition, face recognition, etc. We propose a hierarchical and reversible method for extracting features from convolutional neural networks, which is able to automatically extract deep hierarchical features, able to obtain a good number of features at various resolutions, and able to abstract a number of different aspects of the image. It has been extensively tested on five datasets. The results are significantly superior to previous methods under various metrics. It also performs particularly well in difficult situations such as the background is complex, multiple objects are mixed, and the contrast is low. The proposed method has the potential to be used in the fields of image processing, content-aware resizing, visual tracking, and computational photography.

        " Root phenotyping is essential to understand the interactions between plant and soil, but MRI makes it difficult to accurately extract root structures due to the low contrast, noise and distortion caused by the partial volume effect. Our method addresses these limitations by first enhancing the spatial resolution of the MRI images with a deep learning-based super-resolution framework, followed by a 3D U-Net for the precise extraction of the root systems. 3D U-Net for the Segmentation of Plant Root MRI Images in Super-Resolution A 3D U-Net has been trained and evaluated on a large-scale dataset of plant root MRI images, with manual annotations to ground truth. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional methods and reduces the mean surface distance error by 42 per cent compared with low-resolution methods. The resulting extractor is capable of extracting the true depth and branching of the roots, which are essential for agronomic studies and the improvement of crop production.

        " In the present paper, we introduce a mixture of Hawkes process, for modelling the temporal evolution of a multi-aspect network. Temporal networks, where nodes interact through discrete events which take place at a given time, are ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social media and financial transactions. It is difficult for a network embedding method to capture the complex temporal dynamics and the multi-aspect nature of these interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a mixture of Hawkes process, called MATCH, for modelling the temporal structure of the network and simultaneously learning node-aspect representations and aspect-aspect intensity functions. By learning node-aspect representations, MATCH represents both the network structure and the complex temporal dependencies between the events. We develop an efficient inference scheme for MATCH based on an efficient variational iterative procedure that scales to large networks. Moreover, our model can reveal meaningful patterns from the temporal network. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that MATCH significantly outperforms existing methods in the link prediction, event time prediction and node classification tasks.",

The method proposed here, which we call causal graph convolution (CGC), first deals with the confounding factors that may lead to spurious correlations between node features and node labels, and then appropriately adjusts the message passing mechanism. It explains when and how a node can trust the features of its neighbors in graph convolution, using causal inference as a simple yet effective method to distinguish between the usefulness and potentially harmful influences of neighbors. The limitations of the traditional message passing mechanism are theoretically analyzed, and the performance of the graph convolution model is further improved by introducing causality-aware neighbor filtering. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data show that CGC can outperform standard graph convolution in most cases, especially when there is noise or attack in the network.",

This paper proposes a hierarchical graph representation, where nodes of different levels encode local features at different scales. We call our method Spatial Pyramid Graph Reasoning Network. These nodes are in charge of integrating both local details and the overall context. It has been shown by extensive experiments on several standard datasets such as Cityscapes, ADE20K and Pascal VOC that this method gives better results than other methods, which have only taken into account convolutions and attentions. The method is particularly suitable for objects with complex boundaries and scenes of different scales, confirming the importance of structured reasoning at different scales for the performance of semantic segmentation tasks.. In particular, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of our pyramid-based nodes.",
        " In spite of its simplicity, a linear network has a very complex iterative learning process, which results in a solution that is not explicitly enforced by the loss function. We have developed a general mathematical formula which unites previously isolated results about the iterative behavior of gradients, the exploitation of margins, and feature learning. Gradient-based optimization in linear networks always tends to result in solutions with low rank and with certain spectral properties, which depend on the distribution of the data and the initialization. Through extensive analysis and empirical data, we have shown that this framework can explain the generalization capability of the overparameterized linear network on various tasks, such as regression, classification and matrix completion. We prove that the training of a linear network always results in low-rank solutions with special spectral properties, which depend on the initial conditions and the distribution of the data. This is the first fundamental explanation of why certain solutions are implicitly preferred in the training of neural networks, without explicit regularization.",

Extensive experiments on several biomedical image segmentation tasks, including cross-modality adaptation of MRI to CT and cross-discipline adaptation of histopathology images, show that this framework outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods. Our approach provides a promising solution for deploying segmentation models across varied clinical settings without the prohibitive cost of acquiring new annotations for each target domain.

The self-attention mechanism allows the network to pay different attention to the nodes and nodes and their temporal dependencies, thus learning the complex patterns of the graph evolution. We conduct extensive experiments on various dynamic graphs, and our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of node classification, edge prediction and graph classification. We also show that the learned representation can capture local and global temporal patterns in the graphs. The results show significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency, especially for large-scale dynamic graphs that have frequent structural changes.",
        " The Abstract of this paper is as follows: Dynamic graphs, that is, graphs whose structure changes over time by the addition, removal, and modification of nodes and edges, are gaining in importance in modelling complex real-world systems such as social networks, transport networks, and biological interactions. While the main emphasis of traditional graph embedding techniques is on the static graph, recent research on dynamic graph embedding has shown great potential for capturing temporal evolution and structural changes. In this survey, we review the state-of-the-art of dynamic graph embedding, dividing it into discrete-time methods, continuous-time methods, and random walk-based methods. This survey is intended to be a comprehensive reference for people interested in learning the network representation and temporal network analysis. We analyse the theoretical background, the complexity of implementation, and the scalability of the methods, and discuss their application to tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and anomaly detection in dynamic networks. Finally, we discuss open problems such as the support of multiple temporal patterns, the scalability of large dynamic graphs, and the combination of external information.",
        " This paper quantifies the ‘language prior’ problem, whereby some VQA models can answer questions correctly without relying on any visual understanding whatsoever, but rather by exploiting statistical biases in the data. It is shown that models can produce correct answers without any consideration of the visual content of the image, but by learning the statistical relationship between question and answer. To combat this issue, we propose a debiasing framework which combines adversarial learning with a question-only branch to explicitly model and mitigate language biases. Our experimental analysis reveals that up to 49% of questions answered correctly by state-of-the-art models rely on only the language patterns of the questions. Our method reduces reliance on language biases while retaining good performance on balanced data. It is shown that our approach improves VQA models’ visual understanding by encouraging them to focus on the visual content of the image.",
        " An ad hoc study has been conducted to study the stability of the flame in the spray pyrolysis process. This study has been performed with a view to characterizing the flame stability in real time using artificial intelligence. This approach was tested under conditions of control in a set of experiments. High-speed images at 1000 frames per second have been collected under a range of operating conditions. The flame stability was classified with a 94.3% accuracy. A recurrent neural network was used to predict the onset of flame instability up to 0.8 s in advance of the visual detection, enabling preventive intervention. This approach thus has significant potential for the process optimization and quality control of industrially produced particles. Moreover, the flame stability of the spray pyrolysis flame has been characterized in a quantitative way and correlated with the properties of the particles.",
        " The working day at the office of the Syndicate for Public Instruction ended in the early afternoon, and at seven the official report was read. This paper is devoted to a study of the generalization properties of deep reinforcement learning in the continuous domain. Despite great progress in the performance of DRL on training environments, it is still a difficult task to make such a system adapt itself to new conditions. In this paper we test several deep reinforcement learning algorithms, such as SAC, TD3 and PPO, under a variety of conditions designed to test their generalization properties. We identify key architectural and training factors that can affect generalization, such as the size of the network, the choice of regularization and the diversity of the training experience. We demonstrate the effectiveness of data augmentation and representation learning by conducting a number of omission experiments. We also show that through the addition of features to the environment, learning by example and learning representations can significantly improve the performance of the agent. We have gained insights into the fundamental limitations of current approaches and we propose guidelines for developing continuous DRL systems with improved generalization properties. Finally, we propose a novel regularization method that encourages the extraction of features in the context of varying environments.",
        " Despite the remarkable developments in the field of explainable machine learning for the medical domain, there is a significant gap between the technical explanations and their practical utility for the clinical end users. This paper reports a mixed-methods study of clinicians' requirements for ML explanations in the real world, using semi-structured interviews with 24 physicians in various specialties, and a survey with 98 clinicians. The results show that explanation needs vary significantly depending on the context, the criticality of the task, and the clinician's experience. Contextual factors that affect the utility of a model explanation include time constraints, task complexity, risk level, and the clinician's role in the decision-making process. Although a model's underlying method is valued, the study participants primarily preferred explanations that focused on clinically relevant clinical data and comparative information rather than on detailed model mechanics. This work fills a gap between technical research and clinical implementation, and could facilitate the uptake and effective use of ML systems in the clinic. We propose a framework for contextually relevant ML explanations in the clinic, and we outline design principles for ML explanations that meet the clinical end users' practical needs.",
        " GLBR is an approach for unsupervised learning which allows the sharing of information between global features and local neighbourhoods. GLBR is composed of two main components: a global-to-local reasoning component which exploits contextual information from the global shape to enhance the local point’s representation and a local-to-global reasoning component which aggregates enriched local features to refine the global understanding. A combination of these two components results in a bi-directional, self-reinforcing loop which continuously improves both levels of representation without any manual labelling. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that our method performs well on tasks such as shape classification, feature localization, and learning-from-single-shot. In particular, our method achieves 92.8% accuracy on the shape classification task of ModelNet, and also demonstrates good generalization on unseen data. Our ablation experiments on the data give insights into the effectiveness of the bi-directional reasoning mechanism.",
        " IT’S NOW WELL KNOWN that BatchNorm is an essential technique for training deep neural networks, enabling faster and more stable learning by normalizing the inputs to the layer. However, the capabilities of the normalization of the input are limited, which may restrict the expressivity of the neural network. In this paper, we introduce a new BatchNorm with enhanced linear transformation, which can extend the normalization with a more flexible linear transformation. Experimental results on image classification, object detection, and natural language processing show that ELT-BatchNorm is always more accurate than standard BatchNorm. On ImageNet, our method obtains 1.2% higher accuracy, and on COCO, a higher average precision of 1.5%, while improving convergence speed on all the three problems. Moreover, the number of operations is reduced by less than 5%, and the method is compatible with existing architectures. The learned transformation functions provide insights into the representation of features at different layers and on different tasks.",
        " To the preface of this paper I am obliged; the authors wish to point out that the paper represents the first step towards the search of a new class of networks which is able to produce highly accurate and detailed representations of images and of their semantic content. The paper presents a novel architecture search method for semantic image segmentation. The architectures discovered by Deep Convolutional Neural Architecture Search outperform hand-crafted networks and previous architecture search methods, giving state-of-the-art results with fewer parameters. Our architecture on the Cityscapes data set gives an average IoU of 82.7 % and an average IoU of 86. 1% on the Pascal-Voc-2k test set. We intend to make the code and pre-trained models available publicly to facilitate future research. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of the discovered architectures, revealing insights into the design of effective semantic segmentation networks.",
        " ... The present paper is an attempt to develop a new method for recognizing images, by means of self-growing generative adversarial networks. The most important thing in this method is that, in response to the problem of lack of labeled data, the model, by a process of self-reduction, is extended when performance falls off. The network decides itself when to increase its size by measuring the performance of its discrimination test on a separate training set. Our method reduces the need for manual architecture design and provides better results than the best existing models for semi-supervised learning, where only 5–10 percent of the data are labeled. The method has been tested on the CIFAR–10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets, and the results have been compared with the results of fixed architecture GANs. In addition, we analyze the dynamics of growth and their connection with the ability to generalize.",
        " A decomposition is a structure in which the composition of two triads of nerve cells is the requisite for decoding a material, but a structure composed of two neuronal nets is the required symphony. The representations of the elements of which the cell is composed are similarly distinguished, and of which the component which is the cell entrusted with the job of recognizing is itself the molecule, while the component which is designated the axon is the synapse, which is the axonometric or atheric axons is incessantly renewed by the more or less rapid and incessant activity of arithmetical operations. Any representation of a material can be a sort of design or a simple illustration of a notion, which by its triad is the medium which the cell receives. Its memory is not complete, like that of the articulating cells, but it is not in the way in which the memory of the most developed organizations is. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, including Kinetics-700, Something-Something-v2, and ActivityNet, achieving a particular success in the complex and recursive temporal contexts. It also enables an emergent and unified comprehension in the corresponding downstream tasks, such as a text-to-text translation, a semantic search, and the answering of questions. It represents a major step toward the comprehensive interpretation of visual content at scale.",
        " a [* ] VQas are usually made on complex questions, but their capacity to cope with the simplest of all questions remains unknown. We therefore set up a framework for analyzing the robustness of state-of-the-art VQas by subjecting them to a comprehensive test of their abilities to cope with elementary questions, such as the presence or absence of an object, its count, its color and its position. We find that these models are unexpectedly weak when confronted with basic questions, especially when images contain distracters or unusual contexts. We measure this performance gap and show how it is exacerbated by a detailed analysis of the errors. Finally, we show that models retrained on our basic question test yield improved performance, not only on simple questions, but also on more complex reasoning tasks, suggesting that the robustness to basic visual concepts is a prerequisite for the operation of advanced visual reasoning. It is important to carefully test and improve the basic skills of the models before tackling more complex tasks.",
        " Among the methods for predicting the properties of molecules, a considerable part of the work has been done by a class of neural networks known as graph-neural networks, or GNNs, which have been able to learn effectively the structural features of molecular graphs. Now, it has been found that the classical form of such networks (known as message-passing neural networks) do not effectively express the hierarchical structure of the molecules. In this work we propose a new method, called HIMP, which takes into account the hierarchy of molecular hierarchies and the localized properties of localized neural-neural interactions between nodes of the GNN. Our method, using a generalized form of message-passing neural networks, enables information to flow between atoms, molecular fragments, and general properties of molecules. Using extensive experiments on QM9, MoleculeNet, and the Open Catalyst Project, HIMP demonstrates improvements over state-of-the-art methods for the prediction of diverse properties, ranging from the properties of the quantic, to the properties of the biology of molecules. We have demonstrated that HIMP is able to learn the local chemical environments and the long-range interactions that are important for predicting complex molecular behavior. We have also analyzed the interpretability of our method, showing that the HIMP recognizes chemically relevant substructures which help to predict specific properties.",
        " The form of a man shaved from the top of his head, even though he was a devotee of the art, would still be an ugly spectacle in the desert, in the grasslands, or on the shores of a lake. And it is far more easy to go and slay the lion of our stag. The ancients knew it well, and with their help made a kind of tiger, which fought the enemy, and made three-legged leaps. Theobens, a Greek poet, having read the great work of St. Hieronymus, and knowing, at least in part, what was to come, said: And let the reader imagine, from the quill of the sublime poet, that he himself has been among the great, and has looked at the earth and heaven and seen the glorious images of the sky, the waters, the trees, and the savagery of the tigers and lions he slain; this kind of living wolf roars in the wilderness, and hides under the stony rocks; its erect, furry, and thick-maned tiger-like thighs, it raises the body on its hind legs; it was a kind of lion, which tramples on the forest; and there is some sort of white, which hides from the heat and from the eyes, but it leaps forward; it is called a tiger-hound;",
        " The K-means clustering technique, although widely used and much improved, has certain shortcomings, such as the difficulty of initializing the centroids, the vulnerability to outliers and the difficulty of choosing the number of clusters. In this paper we present the K+means clustering technique, which overcomes some of the shortcomings of the K-means clustering technique. The clustering method still achieves a good performance and efficiency, but the clustering quality is greatly improved. In the experiment, the clustering quality has been evaluated on several different data sets. It is found that K+means has an average accuracy improvement of 27% over K-means and a reduction in iterations of 35%. It is suggested that K+means will be a useful method for various clustering applications, such as image segmentation, customer classification and document classification.",
        " – “A new approach for editing historic photographs by using a learned noise prior. Historical photographs often suffer from deterioration, film grain and distortions, which present a great challenge to modern editing tools. We present a framework that separates the intrinsic image content from its noise characteristics, which enables high-quality editing while preserving the authentic aesthetic of the original photograph. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other approaches that either remove the characteristic noise or do not take it into account when editing. Our approach uses a deep generative model, trained on a large dataset of historical photographs, to learn the statistical properties of noise from the given period. This learned noise prior is used as a regularization term during the editing operation to ensure that colorization, inpainting, and object removal operations are consistent with the noise characteristics of the original photograph. Our framework opens up new possibilities for digital restoration and creative editing of photographic archives while preserving their historical visual character. Our users confirm that the modified images retain the perception of authenticity while benefiting from modern editing capabilities.",
        " Transfer learning is a central technique for medical image analysis, but the choice of a source of images is still a source of discussion. This study investigates whether a model is better trained on natural images (e.g., ImageNet) or on domain-specific images in medical image classification. Having trained a network on a network that can be transferred to the medical domain, we used it to classify x-rays, CT, MRI, ultrasound, and histopathology images. The experiments showed that, while the network trained on natural images was a strong starting point, the network trained on medical images had better accuracy and sensitivity, and was able to be brought to convergence more quickly. It was found that this difference in performance was smaller with larger training sets but remained substantial for the sparse training set typical of medical applications. Further analysis of the feature representations by visualization techniques revealed that the medical images captured more relevant anatomical structures and pathological patterns.",
        " Embedding Source Code This work reviews the underlying source-code representation methods from the past to the present, from the classical feature-engineering method to the latest deep-learning-based techniques. In particular, it presents a review of recent neural-network-based methods for coding source code, from the recurrent neural-network, the network-of-networks, and the GRUNN architecture. This review highlights recent research trends by comparing the performance of the encoding methods in various downstream tasks and by analyzing the trade-offs between the network's complexity, interpretability, and performance. In addition, we present several outstanding challenges such as out-of-vocabulary tokens, inter-language generalization, and the use of program context. This work will be useful for the researcher and the practitioner in understanding the current landscape of source-code embedding and in identifying promising directions for future work. It can be concluded that the hybrid approach combines both structural and semantic features and that the pre-training for a specific domain will push the performance to the next level.",
        " The classification and localization of the seat of thoracic disease in the chest X-ray still remains one of the most difficult tasks in the system of artificial aid in the diagnosis of the chest. This paper proposes a new method of improving the performance of the diagnosis of thoracic diseases, which combines dynamic routing mechanism with deep learning. The proposed architecture adopts the capsule network dynamic routing strategy, which according to the input feature can determine the optimum path of the network. The deep capsule network is based on the concept of variable depth, which is very effective for the effective and efficient aggregation of multiple neural networks. It is also used to select the corresponding layers in the network, thereby achieving a complete learning. By demonstrating this work on a set of images containing a total of 112,120 frontal X-rays with 14 different disease categories, we show that the use of the dynamic routing mechanism can greatly improve the performance of the classification, and can be compared with the previous work of the VNN. In addition, it can also produce a class-wise localization map, which is proved by radiologists to be consistent with the clinically significant positions of the chest. This demonstrates that the dynamic routing mechanism can greatly improve the classification performance of thoracic diseases, and the localization map can provide a more accurate and interpretable basis for the disease. The architecture is particularly effective in recognizing small changes and differentiating similar diseases.",
        " This paper presents a new framework for the construction of sparsely perturbed images, which are particularly useful for corrupting object detection. We formulate the problem as a constrained optimization that optimizes for both attack strength and sparsity. This yields highly successful attacks that occupy less than 1% of the image with permutations. Several experiments show that the attacks work well in the presence of various defenses and are surprisingly portable across different architectures. Such a result clearly shows that there are significant flaws in current object detection systems.",
        " ‘Pix2Shape’: Towards Unsupervised Learning of 3D Scenes from Images with a View-based Representation ’17 We introduce a novel framework for unsupervised learning of 3D scene representations from images, without any supervision in the third dimension. We consider that by learning consistent multi-views from a single image implicitly encodes 3D structure, and are easier to handle, more compatible with the 2D training signals. Distinguishing shape from view from appearance in an unsupervised way is proven by extensive experiments on synthetic and real data. Pix2Shape jointly learns to extract view-invariant scene features and to generate novel viewpoints with consistent geometry, using a differentiable rendering module. Our views transfer well to downstream tasks, such as object recognition and scene understanding, demonstrating the power of view-based representations for unsupervised 3D scene understanding.",
        " This paper presents a new approach to the recognition of egocentric activities based on a fusion of audio-visual features. While other systems rely only on visual features, we show that the combination of both visual and acoustic features improves the recognition accuracy and robustness, especially in those situations where visual information is missing. To do this, we introduce a new multilevel architecture, which effectively fuses both features, thus capturing both the temporal dynamics and the cross-modal relations. Our experiments on three datasets show that our multi-modal system increases the recognition accuracy by 8.2 % compared to the uni-modal base. Moreover, a detailed analysis shows that the addition of acoustic features increases the accuracy especially for activities with a distinctive acoustic signature but similar visual appearance. Our method is based on a combination of convolutional neural networks to extract spatial features from the images and recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms to process the spectrograms and temporal patterns of the sounds. Furthermore, our framework could find applications in the fields of human-computer interaction, ambient intelligence and smart homes.",
        " This work presents the result of a joint study of causal inference mechanisms in neural networks and of those in a system which can recognise and exploit the underlying causality. We describe recent developments in neural network causal learning, counterfactual reasoning and interventional learning, and their implications for the interpretability and robustness of neural networks. Preliminary experiments have shown that by integrating causal structures in neural networks, the learning and prediction performance of the system improves in the tasks of intervention and counterfactual reasoning. We conclude by indicating promising future research directions and presenting open problems and perspectives for advancing causal understanding in neural networks, thereby contributing to the bridging of the gap between statistical learning and causal reasoning.",
        " High-contrast high-intensity pictures have become increasingly common in modern photography, and they pose new problems for digital image forensics. This paper proposes a new way of forensically analyzing HDR pictures by means of convolutional neural networks. Using the data from an image database with genuine and fake images, we show that our method reaches an accuracy of 94.7% and outperforms the best forensic methods in terms of performance. Moreover, our method is resistant to some 'anti-forensic' methods, and it also has high performance with different formats of HDR images and different methods of tonal rendering. This paper brings new perspectives to the emerging field of digital image forensics for high-contrast images and provides a reliable way of authenticating HDR images in the growing world of high-contrast images.",
        " EffiScene: efficient rigidity inference for unsupervised learning of motion, optical flow, and depth. Unlike previous methods which treat these problems separately or use two-stage frameworks, our method includes a rapid estimation of rigidity which enables the network to properly use geometric constraints. Experimental results on KITTI and Cityscapes show that our framework learns the four tasks simultaneously and at much lower cost. Furthermore, we show that our combined framework greatly improves generalization by providing each task with strong supervision from the other. Our framework uses the complementary nature of the tasks: depth and motion describe the static scene structure, while optical flow provides both rigid and non-rigid motion. This method is an important step towards efficient scene understanding for robots in dynamic environments.",
        " Introducing Deep Multi-Task Augmented Feature Learning via Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks. We introduce Deep Multi-Task Augmented Feature Learning (DMTAFL), which makes use of a two-level hierarchical graph to capture the features as well as the tasks. We train a dg-rep network, a deep convolutional network, and use a 3-layer convolutional network to perform the task of taking the deep s-dg from one layer to the next, i.e. Our method is to combine two convolutional networks in the attention mechanism, which can learn tasks and features dynamically, and train them together with knowledge sharing. Experimental results on a variety of multi-stage datasets from various domains show that DMTAFL is superior to state-of-the-art multi-stage learning methods. This method not only increases the accuracy of the prediction, but also increases the interpretability of the model by defining the relationship between the tasks and the features. Especially for tasks with different degrees of interdependence, our method has a good performance in the occurrence of rare data. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis of the model convergence property and the conditions under which the knowledge transfer is most beneficial.",
        " This article presents a new framework for generating explanations for machine-learned models at different levels of abstraction. Unlike previous methods for explaining machine learning models, which are generally based on a single level of abstraction, our method is model-agnostic and can explain at a range of different conceptual levels, from feature importance to semantic concepts. Our framework adapts to different stakeholder needs and allows users to seamlessly switch from technical feature importance explanations to abstract concepts. This addresses a major limitation of previous X-AI methods, by providing context-sensitive explanations that span the gap between technical precision and conceptual clarity. Our experimental evaluations show that our framework is effective in enhancing human-machine collaboration by enabling more effective human-machine collaboration by simultaneously supporting technical debugging and high-level justification. We prove this through extensive experiments on image classification, natural language processing, and tabular data.",
        " A theory of affordances in reinforcement learning This paper introduces a theoretical framework for introducing affordances into reinforcement learning (RL) systems. Affordances, a concept of the Ecological Psychology that describes the possibilities for action within an environment, offers a promising approach to several problems of RL such as sample inefficiency, exploration, and transfer learning. What is available for action? Our theory explains affordance-aware Markov decision processes, and it shows how learning and exploiting affordances can speed up policy learning and generalization to new environments. Through theoretical analysis, we show convergence guarantees for affordance-guided RL and bounds on the size of the sample complexity reduction. This paper links the field of Ecological Psychology with RL, establishing a foundation for the development of more efficient, more human-like, and more general-purpose artificial agents. Our experiments show that affordance-guided agents can learn 35–60 % faster than classical RL agents, and can learn to exploit affordances more robustly and transferablely.",
        " A GENDER-ADVERSARIAL NETWORK... In this paper, we describe SkrGAN, a generative-adversarial network architecture, which relies on a sketching-rendering strategy to generate high-quality medical images. Our network firstly creates anatomical sketches which include essential structural information, and then renders them into realistic images while preserving the clinically relevant features. We show that, compared with previous work on a large range of image modalities (MRI, CT, X-ray), SkrGAN outperforms state-of-the-art GANs in terms of image quality, image diversity and pathological detail preservation. Quantitative evaluation of our work, using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) metrics, as well as radiologist assessment, shows its superiority. Furthermore, we show that SkrGAN images can be effectively used to augment training data for supervised learning tasks, resulting in up to a 17% improvement in accuracy of the learning of classification and supervised recognition tasks. The method we propose can serve as a promising solution to the problem of medical image scarcity and to protect the privacy of patients.",
        " These two operations, while apparently opposed to each other, may yet be reconciled. This paper proposes a unified approach, based on a single GAN architecture, which at the same time learns compact latent representations and the high fidelity of the image. This framework is particularly suitable for applications where image storage and generation are required, such as content creation platforms or augmented reality systems. The experiments show that our model achieves compression ratios comparable to those obtained by dedicated compression methods, while preserving the ability to generate realistic images from random samples of this same space. And, moreover, it provides an interesting insight into the shared information bottleneck between these two, traditionally isolated, problems.",
        " With this paper we introduce a comprehensive set of reinforcement learning (RL) environments for the simulated Franka Emika Panda robot, to facilitate research in robot grasping. These environments are implemented following the OpenAI Gym framework, which makes them easily compatible with existing RL methods and moreover enables us to focus on the specifics of robot grasping. They support the reversibility of rewards and goals, they simulate the realistic physics of the world, and they are connected to the simulation of real-world applications by means of realistic simulation of physics. Our experiments show that our environments can be used to efficiently learn generalizable policies that can achieve many goals using the same underlying model. We also present a performance analysis of these methods, with respect to sample efficiency and generalization performance, which can serve as a basis for future research. We compare several recent reinforcement learning methods, such as Hindsight Experience Replay (HER), Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), to various grasping tasks, from simple reach-and-grab tasks to complex sequences of actions. We hope that our work will provide the RL and robot communities with a useful tool to facilitate research in the development of flexible robot manipulation skills.",
        " This paper presents a new approach to screen content image segmentation based on Least-Absolute-Distance fitting. Unlike traditional image segmentation methods which suffer from the unsteady and heterogeneous nature of screen content images, such as sharp edge, text, and so on, our method takes advantage of the robustness of the LAD fitting method and is robust to outliers. The key idea is to construct a mathematical model of the image that is a mixture of three component image, which we call the SCI, and then to represent the SCI by a fitting model. Our method is very effective in the identification of text, graphic and photographic content in the image, and a local structure model is used to segment it. Experimental results on the SCI standard dataset show that our method is more effective than the existing method in terms of accuracy, and the line accuracy is also 15% higher, and the accuracy of the curved line is [p]. The proposed method can be used to efficiently compress SCIs, accurately render SCIs, and accurately support SCIs, which is very helpful for the corresponding display, and is also an important part of the image to be used for remote presentation...",
        " Of a highly-organized visual system for the study of time-series data, we introduce a new methodology based on the study of images and the use of neural networks designed for image processing. We thus open up new possibilities of cross-modal learning in time-series and the possibility of using the results of vision in applications. Our experiments, on diverse time-series, including financial markets, energy consumption and climate data, show that VisualForecast reduces the prediction error by 17-23%, and demonstrates an enhanced robustness to noise and data gaps. Moreover, the visual nature of the method allows for a direct understanding of the visual features that most influenced the predictions.",
        " And we give you here a summary of our report on a comprehensive data set of automobile data, in the form of point clouds, for use in all sorts of applications, and to meet the urgent need for high-quality data to accelerate the development of perception for autonomous driving systems. It is a product of more than a hundred hours of real-world driving situations gathered by a set of sensors in automobiles that are operated in various types of conditions. Unlike other data sets, which emphasize data from cameras or Lidar, the RadarScenes set is focused on the unique capabilities of the Radar in adverse weather and in variable lighting conditions. The set includes point clouds with accurate spatial and temporal annotations of a wide variety of objects, weather conditions, and driving situations. Each point in the data set has its classification information, making it especially useful for object detection, tracking, and classification. Release of this data set to the research community is meant to accelerate the development of robust perception systems, which will contribute to the safety and dependability of automobiles in real-world conditions. Detailed information on the calibration of the sensors and the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the systems also contributes to the fair comparison of the performance of different algorithms.",
        " This paper presents a method of making convolutional neural networks that are independent of their coordinates. This problem has been a stumbling block to the generalization of convolution to general manifolds. In this paper we show how to overcome this problem by developing a precise mathematical formulation of gauge-invariant convolutions that respect the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. By defining features as tensors or as a combination of tensors and vectors in a local coordinate frame, we can design convolution kernels that transform appropriately under a change in coordinates. Moreover, we show theoretically that our method can be guaranteed to be equivariant and that its behavior is robust under deformations of the manifold. Our method enables us to make geometric convolutions that respect the mathematical structure of the manifold. Experiments with spherical data, curved surfaces, and general Riemannian manifolds show that our method outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and generalization.",
        " While the classical Reinforcement learning methods are aiming for maximization of total profit, our method is based on a controlled exploitation of the profit/performance trade-off. Reward Conditioned Policy is a framework for implementing an RCP, where the agent acts according to the state observation and the target rewards. Our approach shows particular promise in critical applications, where the pursuit of maximum profit can lead to unacceptable risk taking. We have shown that the RCP can be efficiently trained with a modified version of the standard policy gradient methods and that it requires less computing power than the classical policy gradient methods. Our approach shows promise in a wide range of applications, where maximum reward may lead to unwanted risk taking. Our method provides the possibility of building more controllable and more interpretable learning agents that can cope with different reward preferences and constraints.",
        " We introduce RayNet, a framework for real-time arbitrary-shape text detection in natural scenes. Unlike previous methods that model text instances using polygons or segmentation-based representations, our approach models text instances using multiple rays emitted from central points. This model enables RayNet to efficiently detect text with curved, rotated, and irregular shapes. Testing on challenging datasets such as Total-Text, CTW1500, and MSRA-Td500, show that RayNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining real-time speed. Our dynamic ray allocation mechanism allocates more rays to complex text instances while using fewer rays for simpler ones, which enables RayNet to take advantage of ray-tracing hardware. Accordingly, our method is suitable for resource-constrained applications such as smart-phones or real-time video analysis.",
        " The method of the present paper is to extract the intrinsic objectness from sonar images by means of deep learning. We have assumed no preconceived notion of the class of objects to be detected, but seek merely to separate them from the more or less complex background. The present method may be of great utility in underwater robots where novel objects are encountered with some frequency and the data for specific classes may be inadequate. In extensive experiments on a number of sonar images we have demonstrated that the method achieves a higher object detection accuracy than that obtained with class-based methods. This paper is a step towards flexible and robust underwater robots capable of operating successfully in unknown environments.",
        " This paper introduces Multimodal Reward Shaping (MRS), a new framework that exploits different information sources to help an agent explore more efficiently. It combines visual, semantic, and dynamic information to infer auxiliary rewards to complement the scarce external rewards. Testing shows that a combination of different modalities can improve the effectiveness of guidance. By using an adaptive weighting mechanism, MRS can create a rich reward landscape which both encourages exploration and rewards exploitation. In several diverse exploration tasks, including navigation, robot manipulation, and game playing, we demonstrate that MRS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both sample efficiency and performance. Multimodal reward shaping therefore offers a promising way forward for tackling the exploration challenge in reinforcement learning. MRS is also shown to be compatible with existing RL methods and easy to be embedded into various policy optimization frameworks.",
        " Having just deduced that models working on tabular and textual data are often susceptible to unintentional biases that can lead to discriminatory results for groups that are legally protected, this paper presents a framework for detecting, measuring, and reducing such biases in ML models. Using the financial, medical, and content moderation applications of this framework, the authors report a reduction in the biases metrics of 45 to 68% over existing methods, while affecting model performance by only a small drop of 3%. As a result, they state, “This framework enables practitioners to systematically address bias concerns, while preserving the practical utility of ML systems in diverse real-world applications.” They also provide a number of practical guidelines for bias auditing throughout the ML life-cycle.",
        " This paper addresses the fundamental problem of ensuring safety in reinforcement learning (RL) systems by formalizing and analyzing safety-constrained optimization within constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). While standard RL is designed to optimize the cumulative reward, many real-world applications require adherence to safety constraints in both the learning and the execution phases. We propose a novel framework which directly encodes safety constraints into the optimization problem by constrained policy optimization. We provide theoretical guarantees for the learning convergence and give bounds on the violations in the learning process. We then show through extensive experiments on a variety of simulated and real-world applications that our approach is able to achieve similar performance as unconstrained methods, while reducing significantly the number of violations. Our framework is particularly effective in the setting of high-dimensional continuous control problems, where safety concerns are paramount.",
        " This work proposes a novel hybrid method to predict chaotic spatio-temporal systems from imperfect observations and incomplete knowledge of the model. The method combines the strength of the ensemble Kalman filter with that of the reservoir computing. The hybrid method is demonstrated on two representative chaotic systems, the Lorenz-96 model and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, under various conditions of sparsity of observations, noise contamination and model uncertainty. It is shown that this method outperforms both methods used separately, by increasing the forecast horizon by 30 to 45 % and by reducing the error by 60 % in comparison with existing methods. This work paves the way for a more accurate prediction of complex spatio-temporal systems with imperfect observations and knowledge of the model, and has potential applications in weather forecasting, turbulence modelling and other complex dynamical systems.",
        " The inexpressible is usually the one which is the most easily understood. Hence, in a Bandit problem or a resourse-as-you-go problem of a large scale, the best model of the class of the least complex, when compared with others, may be used as the best; but, the question is, how to choose among the various models to employ? Our paper proposes a new method for selecting the best of these models, based on two fundamental and inextricably connected concepts, namely, the concept of balance, and the concept of efference. Our method is designed to be general enough to be combined with different base-algorithms, and yet be effective in its operation. It is proven by us that our method is superior to existing methods, especially in non-stationary and complex situations. In addition, we discuss the significance of our method for examining the fundamental trade-off between exploration, exploitation and the complexity of models in sequential decision-making problems.",
        " “Recently, there has been a considerable increase in the generalization of the objects detected by ray tracing. They have become a popular means of object detection. They are very nearly as successful as if the objects were all a new set of points, all in the same neighbourhood. The detection of modern objects depends on the placement of a number of pre-defined points, as a pointer of the position of the object, but the assignment of the points to the object is still largely heuristic, and thereby not always optimal. In this paper we present FreeAnchor, a method of anchor assignment which is based on a maximum likelihood estimate of the object position. In extensive experiments on the MS COCO database, FreeAnchor improves the performance of different detection architectures, achieving significant improvements over their base cases. Our single-model detector achieves 44.9% mAP on COCO test-dev, outperforming many state-of-the-art methods, while also maintaining efficient inference. The proposed method consists of two key components: a likelihood function which measures the quality of the object-anchor pairs, and a dynamic learning procedure, based on the expectation-maximization (EM) method, which during training optimizes the assignment of the anchors. The experiments show that a principled probabilistic formulation of the assignment of the points to the objects leads to more accurate and robust object detection.",
        " Reliably assessing the depth of a scene requires reliable information on the uncertainty of the depth maps. Deep learning methods have greatly advanced the state of the art of multi-view stereo reconstruction, but few of them can give reliable measures of uncertainty. This paper presents a novel approach to depth estimation from multiple viewpoints that explicitly models the uncertainty in the depth map. The approach is based on two neural networks, one of which predicts the depth, and the other of which predicts the uncertainty. The training of the latter is done with a specialized loss function which encourages the calibration of the probabilities. Extensive experiments on standard examples from ScanNet, ETH3D and KITTI demonstrate the good correlation between the resulting depths and the predicted depths. The prediction of the uncertainty enables the downstream applications to take decisions on the reliability of the depth map, and makes our method particularly suitable for the automation of tasks requiring a safety guarantee. For this, ablation studies have been carried out with different numbers of views and different scenes.",
        " — This is not a very sound argument, since the objections against it are well-founded. But when the motive power of the inquiry is manifested by a great amount of data, it is natural to assume that it will not find support in any particular case, as a multi-dimensional time series is a complicated thing, because of the increasing complexity of time series. We prove here that a multi-dimensional time series is more complex than a uni-dimensional one. The point is not in the ratio of complexity, but in the number of dimensions. We introduce an efficient procedure for the extraction of candidate shapelets from multi-dimensional time series, and a distance measure that takes into account cross-dimensional dependencies. Our method extends the concept of the shapelet transform to the multi-dimensional time series, so as to facilitate the discovery of complex patterns, which may exist simultaneously in many dimensions. Our method is efficient enough to be used for real-time classification of high-dimensional time series. The method also gives an interpretable insight into the dependencies between the dimensions, making it especially valuable for the domains in which explanatory explanations are required.",
        " The second paper in this series is devoted to DeepHMap, a new method of learning a 6D pose from a single color-D image. The method is different from previous ones, in that, instead of using correspondence learning or template matching, it uses a combination of both methods in an end-to-end trainable architecture. It captures both local geometric information and the context of the image in which the object is situated, and is thus quite insensitive to variations in illumination and occlusions. The performance of DeepHMap is tested on standard data, and is shown to be superior to that of any other method in existence. On the LineMod, Occlusion LineMod and YCB-Video data sets, it achieves an average error in rotation of only 2.7°, and in translation of only 0.8 cm. A detailed study of the data by removing both of the methods from the system shows that the combination of the two methods gives much better results than either method alone. The method can be applied in real time to the most difficult poses.",
        " With this novel technique we attempt to develop a deeper neural network which, by making use of spectral graph theory, is capable of acquiring a representation of the graph which is broader and more inclusive than the one which uses only spatial and neural means of the sort which we have described. This method of Spectral Message Passing involves a series of messages which are passed in the spectral form and by a series of adaptations of the frequency of the communication. On the basis of a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that this method avoids the fundamental limitations of conventional neural networks, such as oversmoothing and bottlenecks. Our experiments show that the use of Spectral Message Passing outperforms state-of-the-art neural network models in a large variety of tasks, from node classification to graph classification to link prediction. These results establish Spectral Message Passing as a powerful method for learning graph representations with widespread applications.",
        " Accordingly, in the present paper we present TransTailor, a new method of pruning that systematically eliminates task-irrelevant model parameters from a pre-trained model in order to improve its transfer learning ability. This is a letter from the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, in which a re-training method is discussed that, for a given transfer task, uses the model trained on a new data set. Well, this is just what the tree method does, but this time with weights of different strengths. After extensive experiments in the domains of vision, language, and multi-modal tasks, we show that the performance of TransTailor is similar or superior to that of complete fine-tuning, while the model size is reduced by 30–70%. Notably, the pruning model has a significantly improved ability to generalize to sparse inputs and fast inference times. TransTailor thus provides a practical way to derive efficient task-specific models from large-scale pretrained architectures. We also provide theoretical explanations of why selective pruning before fine-tuning mitigates the problems of negative transfer and overfitting.",
        " Finally, I got a detailed email from Bing Xiangxin with the same title as this one, but without the footnotes. The paper is entitled: A Novel Cross-Attention Based Framework for Sketch-Based Image Retrieval, which presents a novel framework based on cross-attention, a set of attentional structures with two-way bi-directional connections between sketch and image inputs. The system was tested on three benchmarks: the sketcyy, TU-Berlin and quick-drawing datasets, and it was shown that the cross-attention mechanism and the hybrid loss function were effective. After removing the loss function, the performance of the cross-attention mechanism and the hybrid loss function was further improved. It is worth mentioning that the system not only performs well in the task of sketch-based image retrieval at the category level, but also has good performance in the task of fine-grained retrieval, which is an effective method for sketch-based image retrieval., has a great potential for practical application in image search and retrieval systems.",
        " The Article is entitled A New Approach for the Use of Convolutional Neural Networks in the Study of the Representation of Cyclones, in Polar Coordinates, by Convolutional Neural Networks. The paper is devoted to a new application of the CNL of the analysis of the structure of cyclones. The model is trained on a comprehensive data set of 3,000 tropical cyclone images from different ocean basins, transformed into polar coordinates. It was shown that our method achieves an accuracy of 87% in identifying the intensity of cyclones, and, significantly, that it outperforms standard convolutional neural networks by 23%, recognizing main structural features such as eyewalls, rain bands, and asymmetry. The model also extracts and successfully determines the quantitative structure of a cyclone, whose dimensions are very close to the corresponding data from the plane. Objectivity and automation of the process of analyzing the structure of tropical cyclones gives meteorologists an objective and automatic tool that can be used for operational purposes in regions without access to air reconnaissance, thereby improving the accuracy of intensity forecasts and the understanding of cyclone dynamics.",
        " In this paper we present a critical analysis of the quality of probabilistic forecasting methods for retail sales. A rigorous analysis of fifteen probabilistic forecasting methods on diverse retail data from eight industry groups over a five-year period reveals that the uncertainty estimates from these methods are miscalibrated in a variety of ways, with 78% of the models being seriously overconfident in their forecasts. The consequences of such unreliable uncertainty estimates are serious, as they can lead to suboptimal inventory decisions, costing retailers up to 16% of extra storage costs or the potential for running out of stock. We develop a novel methodological framework for evaluating the calibration of probabilistic forecasting methods in retail settings and offer recommendations to address the problems that arise. We also observe an alarming inverse relationship between forecast accuracy and uncertainty calibration quality, whereby the methods with the best point forecast accuracy often have the worst calibration quality. The work is an important warning against the uncritical adoption of probabilistic forecasting methods without due attention to their uncertainty calibration properties.",
        " To overcome this difficulty, we propose Generation for Adaptation, a generative model based on GANs, that can create synthetic point clouds similar to the target, preserving the semantic information from the source. The three-dimensional point cloud is often irregular in shape and sparse in density, and so it is difficult to make it correspond to the demands of a task. Using a geometric consistency loss, the GAN can preserve the structural consistency of the target data, and a feature mapping loss that minimizes the gap in the distribution of the two domains. In the experiments, we use the ModelNet40, ShapeNet and KITTI data sets to verify our method, and it outperforms the best results of previous methods in terms of accuracy of classification and segmentation. Our proposed method offers a promising direction for unsupervised domain adaptation in the processing of three-dimensional point clouds, with potential applications in the fields of augmented reality, robot vision and driving. In the process of adapting to different properties of the two domains, GFA successfully preserves the fine-grained geometric features of the original data.",
        " ‘This paper introduces a novel framework that simultaneously models the relationship between brain function and behaviour. Unlike traditional approaches, which focus on one dimension only, or simply use correlation between the two domains, our framework exploits the intrinsic geometrical properties of both data domains, thereby uncovering their complex interrelationships. This framework provides a mathematically sound basis for combining brain and behavioural data while respecting the intrinsic geometrical properties of both domains. Through experiments on large neuroimaging datasets, including the Human Connectome Project, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms conventional methods in predicting brain-behaviour associations and uncovers brain-behaviour relations that are neurobiologically plausible.",
        " This paper presents a novel framework for interpreting generative models operating on unbounded spatial domains. In contrast to the spatially finite models, which can only produce content with finite dimensions, spatially infinite models pose a unique challenge to interpretation because of their theoretical capacity to produce content with infinite dimensions. The authors develop a formal mathematical characterization of these models and suggest metrics to evaluate their consistency, consistency and contextuality across spatially infinite domains. The authors also prove with extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data that their interpretation framework successfully reveals the presence of emerging patterns, discontinuities and drifts in infinite content generation and that the insight can be used to guide architectural improvements in spatially infinite models, which lead to a significant improvement in the quality of the resulting content and a more predictable behavior of the model at the end of the domain. Spatial interpretability fields are introduced as a concept that describes how model semantics and feature representations evolve across unbounded domains. Our framework offers both a fundamental theoretical and practical foundation for understanding the behavior of a growing class of generative models.",
        " This paper presents an automatic framework for cross-domain learning of a regression task. The system automatically extracts transferable structures from seemingly unrelated domains by learning domain-invariant feature representations while simultaneously learning domain-adapted features. The framework is tested extensively on both synthetic and real-world data sets, and the experiments demonstrate the superiority of the framework over previous methods, particularly when the domain of the target task has little training data. The system follows a two-stage process to search for common features in multiple domains and then iteratively tunes the domain-adapted features using an objective function that combines domain transfer and domain adaptation. The framework requires only simple hyperparameter tuning and it automatically determines when and how much to transfer, which makes it practical in a real-world environment where the domain expert is usually sparse. The results show that the error is reduced by 18-35% in comparison with previous methods for various application domains, such as health, finance, and environment.",
        " In this paper we present a novel method for pruning a deep convolutional network by systematically removing duplicate filters. We use a two-stage pruning strategy, which first detects clusters of similar filters using a specialized similarity measure, then selectively prunes duplicate filters while preserving expressive power. Our method is particularly suitable for very deep networks where redundancy accumulates over successive layers. In addition, it can complement existing pruning methods, while requiring significantly less computation during training. Our experiments on state-of-the-art architectures show that the proposed method can achieve up to a 66% reduction in the number of filters while losing very little performance (less than 1% on ImageNet). It also provides new insights into the internal organization of convolutional networks and can be used to efficiently train deep learning models.",
        " We have created a novel method of enhancing 3D representations with fine-grained geometric detail. Existing 3D shape generation methods excel at producing coarse-grained structures but often struggle to capture fine-grained surface details that are essential to realism. Our method tackles this limitation through a two-stage process of conditional refinement. First, a deco-GAN learns a latent space of geometric details from high-resolution 3D scans, and then, armed with this latent space, it enhances coarse-grained representations with appropriate fine-grained details. In our experiments, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods both on a statistical basis and in qualitative testing across several object categories. Our code and pretrained models are available to encourage further research in this direction. The deco-GAN effectively transfers fine-grained details between different categories of object, and is capable of producing multiple plausible refinements from a single coarse-grained input.",
        " An alternative non-parametric model for rational choice and irrational decision making, called the Decision Forest, is presented in this paper. The method exploits ensemble learning methods to predict preference reversals, context-dependent preferences and other choices that confound conventional models of choice. The model's flexibility enables it to establish decision boundaries that correspond to the observed choice rather than to the predictions of a theory, and its interpretability highlights the psychological processes underlying irrational choices. By analyzing data from a number of experiments, ranging from intertemporal choice, risky choices, and framing-dependent choices, the model is shown to perform better than existing rational choice models.",
        " Transfer learning has become a mainstay of modern machine learning, enabling a model trained on one task to perform well on a related task. However, the theoretical underpinnings of when and why transfer learning works remain largely unknown. In this paper, we present a new method for studying transfer learning using synthetically generated correlated data. The experiment shows that the improvement in performance achieved by transfer learning can be controlled through the correlation structure between the source and target data. Using this approach, we show that the performance gains achieved by transfer learning are predictable in a fundamental way, and that they are based on the strength of the correlation between the source and target data. These results provide a practical guideline to practitioners about when to use transfer learning and contribute to a fundamental understanding of representation transfer between tasks. In addition, we give theoretical bounds on the expected performance gains for various correlation structures.",
        " Deep neural networks learn complex internal representations, and the relationship between the layers remains little understood. We propose a novel attention mechanism, which is based on the minimum description length, which restricts the implicit space of neural networks and, without requiring any supervision, focuses on the most information-efficient features, which in turn yield the most powerful internal representations. In experiments with visual, language and multimodal architectures, we show that this approach reduces the number of features between the layers, creates attentional maps that correspond to human-recognizable features and improves generalization to tasks that are out of the distribution. Formalizing attention in an information-theoretic framework, we demonstrate that MDL-based constraints allow neural networks to learn more compact and interpretable internal representations while maintaining or improving performance. For the first time, our work provides an unsupervised mechanism that enables a deeper understanding of the information flow within neural networks.",
        " Heterogeneous graphs, which contain nodes and edges of different types, are a common data structure in real-world applications, such as social networks and knowledge graphs. However, due to their complexity, traditional graph convolutional networks are often unable to fully learn the complex semantic relationships contained in such graphs. We propose Schema-Aware Deep Graph Convolutional Networks (SA-DGCN), a new framework that explicitly takes the graph structure into consideration during the training process. We further develop a novel attention mechanism, which dynamically weights the neighbors along the meta-paths, enabling the model to learn both local and global semantic features. In experiments on a variety of benchmarks, our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks by up to 15%. The proposed method provides a principled way to integrate the knowledge of the structure of the graph into the deep learning model of heterogeneous graphs. Moreover, our model can better explain the significance of different meta-paths for different tasks.",
        " I am the author of a new method for detecting anomalies in multivariate time series. We present a new method of using Generative Adversarial Neural Net-works (GANs), where the generator is specialized to produce realistic time series sequences, while the discriminator is used to distinguish between the real and the artificially generated. The paper is divided into three parts. In the first, I introduce the GAN model and state its advantages. The second part describes the implementation of the GAN. The third part contains the results of the experiments on time series from different areas, such as industrial systems, medical data, and financial transactions. It was shown that this method could outperform the previous methods and recent deep learning methods by up to 15%, and it was also able to overcome the shortage of the number of samples. This method also provided an explanation of the involved variables and the time periods, which can help to determine the cause of the abnormality.",
        " Common deblurring methods have difficulties in dealing with the irregular blurring caused by camera shake, object motion, or changes in depth, but our method decomposes the blurred image into distinct blurred components according to their characteristics, and then uses these blurred components to guide the restoration process. These components are restored by the convolutional filter independently, and the resulting picture has the characteristics of the original image, which have been restored. To achieve this, we first use the division network to divide the image into a large number of blurred components, and then process these components through a set of parallel deblurring procedures, which have been tuned to restore each type of blurred component. This is a very efficient method, which not only has high accuracy, but also does not need to be carefully estimated. On the many images in the literature, the BCDG method was found to have a PSNR of  2.33 dB better than that of the existing method for complex non-uniform blur, especially for the images with many blurs.",
        " Authors. To remedy this defect, we have devised a new method of training a neural net to learn depth from the three dimensions of a light field. Our experiments on real and synthetic light-field images show that the method produces more accurate results than those obtained with previous unsupervised methods, particularly in regions where there are complicated occlusions. Studies of occlusion prove the value of our method, and show the way it recovers fine geometrical details even in complex scenes. The learning net is based on a multi-scale extractor of features which operate on the spatial and angular dimensions of the light field, followed by a refiner that preserves the sharp edges of the model. The learning net is based on self-organising maps, as were earlier networks. Our method advances the unsupervised reconstruction of depth in light fields towards practical applications in photography, automation and augmented reality.",
        " Deep learning approaches to medical image analysis are often limited by the scarcity of training data, particularly for rare pathologies. We evaluated the efficacy of a deep convolutional generative adversarial network for the augmentation of chest X-rays by a ten thousand image recurrent neural network (DCGAN) trained on chest radiographs from publicly available data-bases. Then we generated synthetic images for a convolutional neural network to be used as an input for a classifier of thoracic pathologies. The classification performance of models trained with synthetic images was compared with that trained with original images alone. The augmented data produced an average accuracy increase of 4.7% (p  0.05) and an AUC improvement of 0.056 on all pathologies. The quality of the synthetic images was assessed by the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and by three expert radiologists. Our results suggest that a DCGAN is a promising approach to the augmentation of medical images, especially for the training of a classifier with scarce data. With an accuracy of 83%, radiologists were able to distinguish synthetic images from real radiographs, but the generated pathologies were judged as clinically plausible. The improvement in performance was greater for rare pathologies. This technique could overcome the scarcity of training data in medical image analysis and improve the diagnostic capability of AI systems.",
        " This paper presents a novel method to increase the detection and counting of mitotic cells in histopathological images using a framework based on a Region Proposal Network (RpN). In a two-stage framework, we first identify regions with the potential to contain mitotic cells with a lightweight RpN, followed by a classification task on the identified areas. Augmented Mitotic Cell Counting by Region Proposal (Rp) System (AMiRC) and Fast Mitotic-Likely Region (FOIP) NN have been evaluated on the TUPAC-16 and MIDOG datasets, and significant improvements over existing methods have been shown. The framework was tested on a set of 105 cancerous images, displaying an accuracy of 87.3% and a sensitivity of 91.2%. The False-positive rate is reduced by 43% in comparison to conventional methods. Our system reduces the computational load by up to 66% compared to other systems. The proposed framework has the potential to be used for other purposes in Computational Pathology. The proposed framework is able to increase the number of detected mitotic cells in cancerous images and increases the accuracy of a cancer grading system.",
        " WHILE WORD-EMBEDDED CLASSIFICATIONS OF TEXTS ARE COMMONLY USED TO FIND AND CLASSIFY THE MEANING OF WORDS, THE CLASSIFICATION OF WORDS TOGETHER WITH THEIR CLASSIFICATION IS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY CLASSIFICATIONS, THE IDENTIFICATION OF WORDS BY CLASSES, WHICH ARE THE SUBJECTS OF THEMs. Therefore, it is necessary to produce the EMBEDDINGS OF CLASSES, BUT NOT WORD-EMBEDDED CLASSIFICATIONS, TO WHICH THIS MEANING IS EXPANDED TO THE CLASSES AND TO THE WORDS IN THEM. This approach has been applied to four Reuters, newgroup, arXiv abstract, and Amazon product review datasets, achieving an average improvement of 4.7 % F1 in performance. The results suggest that explicitly modeling the word-class relationship provides discriminative features for text classification. In addition, the method gives an overview of the class-specific vocabulary importance, enhancing the model explainability.",
        " The authors present a detailed study of the Chan-Vese method for image segmentation. Unlike the contour-based methods, the Chan-Vese method does not rely on the gradient information and uses Mumford-Shah formula to extract object boundaries, and thus it is able to work on images with fuzzy or weakly definable boundaries. The experimental results show that the method is able to work on noisy and multivariate images. In addition, recent developments based on the use of machine learning methods to improve the performance of the method are also discussed. Even in the era of deep learning, the significance of the Chan-Vese method for image analysis and computer vision is emphasized.",
        " The method proposed here overcomes the limitations of other adaptation methods due to the disparity in the feature spaces and the sparsity of the training data. In particular, it encodes the notion of relative similarity into triplets, namely, an anchor, a positive and a negative, for learning a general representation across domains. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method minimizes an upper bound on the cross-domain error while maintaining the consistency of the local structure. Our method has been extensively tested on image recognition, natural language processing, and cross-modal tasks. Extensive experiments on the data show that our method is superior to existing domain adaptation methods, especially in the presence of sparse data. It also achieves a higher degree of transfer learning from unsupervised to semi-supervised settings.",
        " The most serious of all these pitfalls is the insufficiently marked time series which have to be classified, and therefore this paper introduces a novel deep, semi-supervised learning technique which overcomes these difficulties. It is based on the employment of both marked and unmarked time series in a two-layered neural network, which combines supervised classification with unsupervised learning. In experiments on many standard time-series datasets it has been shown that this method is superior to traditional methods, especially when there are only a few examples of marked data; even with only a fifth of the marked data the classifying accuracy of the resulting model is comparable to that of a fully supervised method. Moreover, the system employs a temporal regularization of the network, and also a contrastive learning mechanism suited to the sequential nature of time-series data. This paper provides both a theoretical and a practical solution to the problems of semi-supervised learning and to the real world of time-series classification, where the marked time series are expensive or rare. The learned representations also prove to be effective and transferable to related tasks.",
        " Since current adaptive optimizer methods like Adam and AdaGrad have been found to be effective for densely connected neural networks, they do not explicitly encourage sparsity patterns that are in harmony with the architecture and the hardware. Our proposed method includes regularization terms that promote structured sparsity—that is, sparsity that is locally in the form of the layer, the layer and the filter, and the sparsity of the channel, filter and block—directly into the parameter update rules. It has been shown that the resulting sparse structures provide practical speedups of 1.8 to 3.1 times on commodity hardware without the need for any special sparse calculation libraries. We have proved theoretically that the convergence of the proposed methods is guaranteed for standard assumptions. Our method thus provides a promising direction for the training of deep learning models that are inherently in harmony with the constraints of deployment without the need for post-training pruning and a sparsely designed architecture.",
        " GNN-based Data-Driven Routing (GDDR) This paper presents a novel routing method, based on a GNN, which learns routing policies from network traffic data. The proposed method is very simple: by evaluating the existing route data, it can then optimize the routing policy for each individual node. With extensive experiments on simulated and real network data, the authors show that GDDR can achieve an average reduction of 27% in latency and 35% in throughput over conventional routing protocols, and is able to cope with the various problems of network congestion, link failures, and bursts of traffic. Our model enables the GNN to simulate the complex spatial relationships between the network topology and traffic, and the learning results of the GNN can be visualized using a specialized architecture. Our approach can thus be regarded as a new approach to the study of a GNN that is able to optimize the routing policy based on experience. The fact that it can be learned automatically from the network traffic data makes a big difference to the ability of the method to cope with the network’s complex and dynamic changes. The solution is especially suited to large-scale, multi-faceted networks.",
        " Keeping accurate records of the incoming and outgoing demands of consumers is an important feature of all e-commerce. This paper introduces ARMDN, a new type of deep-learning model, which combines the power of mixture density networks with the temporal nature of recurrent neural networks, and the associative learning mechanism to encode the relationships between products. We train the ARMDN with the data of several large-scale e-commerce platforms, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art forecasting methods in terms of reducing the mean absolute percentage error and improving the quantile loss, and shows that ARMDN can capture complex product relationships, such as seasonality, promotion, product cannibalization, and complementary products. Unlike traditional point forecasting methods, ARMDN generates a full probability distribution over future demand, thus effectively modeling the inherent uncertainty in e-commerce sales patterns. And finally, the number of products that experience stockouts or overstocking is reduced by 14% and 10%, respectively, in the experiment..",
        " A two-stage network comprising two stages: an implicit mapping network which represents the 3D environment, and a localization network which predicts the 6dof camera poses from the rgb images. Our approach to visual localization entails an implicit function that implicitly maps from scene geometry to appearance. When mapped to the scene, the function is then used to encode local features, such as object distances, orientations, occlusions, and occlusions, resulting in a compact scene representation that captures the multi-scale features of the scene. We show that this approach achieves comparable or better performance on both indoor and outdoor data sets, while requiring much less memory. Finally, we discuss the emergence of scene properties from the learned representations and their application to the hierarchical structure of the scene.",
        " The more we apply the various methods of machine learning to a particular case, the better are our results. This paper describes a novel approach that employs multi-step learning methods to enhance the performance of object detection under a variety of conditions and conditions. The experimental results on several benchmarks show that, compared with the results of the single-stage approach, the system shows a significant increase in performance, especially in the difficult cases of small objects and partial occlusions. By using an efficient model and processing selectively, the system is feasible for real-world applications. The main stages are: refinement of initial proposals, feature enhancement through adaptation and reasoning, and the final decision based on context. Our contribution is to show that by strategically decomposing object detection into several special sub-problems, a significant improvement in performance can be achieved while the complexity of the system remains moderate.",
        " Classes-incremental learning represents a major challenge in deep learning, where models must learn new classes while maintaining their performance on the previously learned classes. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Deep-Memory-Consolidation (DMC), to tackle catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental situations without access to the original training data. Our framework unifies the representations from a new-class model and a previously learned model to form a unified architecture that is uniformly good for all classes. Our framework outperforms existing methods with an average accuracy increase of 13.2% on the CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and Caltech-101 data sets, and is more robust to large class-incrementals. Moreover, our method is highly efficient during the consolidation process. We introduce a new loss that ensures the transfer of both decision boundaries and feature representations. Hence, our framework can be used in practical applications that need to learn new classes without catastrophic forgetting.",
        " Over the past decade, neural network models have become increasingly important in practical applications. Two families of explanation methods have developed, namely, perturbation-based methods that examine the impact of small changes in the input, and gradient-based methods that examine the sensitivity of outputs to the gradients of inputs. These two methods seem to be fundamentally different, but this paper will show their connections and propose a unified theoretical framework. Our framework shows that the apparent differences between the two methods stem from implementation choices rather than from a fundamental difference in the concepts. Based on these insights, we develop a novel hybrid method that takes advantage of the complementary strengths of both methods, which is robust to input noise and to adversarial attacks. Our method not only improves our theoretical understanding of explanations but also provides practical tools to make the interpretability of real-world models more reliable. Using large-scale experiments on images, text, and tables, we show that the hybrid method is more stable and faithful than existing methods.",
        " 'The new learning method we propose to improve the behavior of the robot in the case of automobiles takes advantage of visual attention. We employ a multi-head attention network that represents the important aspects of the scene, which we want to take into account. Our method reduces the number of off-road accidents by 37% and improves compliance with traffic rules by 28% in challenging situations. We evaluated our method on simulated and real driving data and demonstrated significant improvements in driving performance metrics compared to an attention-free approach. Our system learned to take the actions of expert human drivers, but also which visual cues were necessary for the decisions to be made. Our results suggest that the addition of a human-inspired mechanism of visual attention significantly improves the robustness and explainability of behavior cloning approaches for driving robots. Moreover, the learned attention maps allow us to visualize the process of making decisions and thus improve transparency and debugging.",
        " “Whereas traditional methods for gaze estimation have tended to use convolutional neural networks, which are incapable of capturing long-range dependencies, context, and self-attention, our proposed approach relies on self-attention to understand the relations between facial features and gaze direction. “This paper introduces a new method of gaze estimation based on the “Transformer” architecture, which has shown remarkable success in a number of tasks in computer vision. “We develop a dedicated transformation for this task, and experiments on standard gaze datasets like MPII Gaze, GazeCapture and ETH-XGaze showed that our method outperformed all previous methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to head pose, lighting, and occlusion. “This work establishes a powerful framework for gaze estimation, which may be used in many applications, such as human-machine interaction, virtual reality, and driver-monitoring systems. “We show, using a retraining method, that the attention mechanism is very important in capturing the fine eye-area features necessary for accurate gaze estimation.”",
        " All the same, the author compares the INTEL-TUT dataset with other similar data in the literature. A study is made of the performances of the methods when they are confronted with data captured by the camera models. Their test results show that the learning method based on a single camera will not be able to produce satisfactory results with images obtained by a camera whose characteristics are unknown to the trained method. The importance of the camera-invariant methods is thus emphasized. The study concludes that the INTEL-TUT data set, which is made up of more than 7,000 images taken in different indoor and outdoor environments and by five different cameras, will yield results more accurate than those obtained from a single camera. The INTEL-TUT data set thus constitutes a major contribution to the field of digital color constancy.",
        " Having a means of bridging the gap between linguistics and visual features, we propose a new method called a query-guided regression network with context policy (QRNCP) that directly predicts the coordinates of a bounding box based on the extracted features from a query text. We conducted experiments on the 30K Flickr, the _Referit, and the _Visual_Genome._ datasets and found that our QRNCP method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods by 4.6%, 3.7%, and 5.1%. We also performed additional experiments on removing the underlying layers to verify the efficiency of our regression network and the context policy. Our system is not only effective in performance, but also highly efficient, making it well suited for the practical task of grounding.",
        " Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a powerful approach for learning visual features without manual supervision. The current state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive results, yet the theoretical understanding of how they work is still very limited. Negative samples have been proposed to act as implicit regularizers to prevent overfitting, and to induce meaningful features by automatically encoding task-related semantic information. In this paper, we systematically study how the composition of negative samples affects the learned representations and their downstream performance. Our results shed light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying instance discrimination and provide practical guidelines for designing more effective self-supervised learning algorithms. We further propose a novel negative sampling strategy which adaptively selects informative negatives based on the difficulty and relevance of the anchor sample, and obtain consistent improvements over different datasets.",
        " “Simple question-answering in a large knowledge-base using a neural-network architecture”; we “develop a new neural-network architecture for efficiently storing and retrieving facts from knowledge bases with millions of entities and relationships; and we show how it can progressively focus on relevant facts while filtering out irrelevant ones, in order to be able to give precise answers even to incomplete or ambiguous questions.” Experimental results show that our memory-augmented neural network achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on questions requiring multi-step reasoning. Moreover, we analyse the model’s attention mechanism in detail, and show how it allows the system to deal with complex factual relationships. We demonstrate the performance of our system on several of the standard question-answering datasets, including WebQuestions, SimpleQuestions, and our own dataset, LargeQAN; and show significant improvements over previous methods. The work we present here represents a major step towards scalable question-answering systems which can use very large knowledge bases, while maintaining high efficiency.",
        " We present SPSG, a self-supervised system for the generation of photometric scenes from colour depth images. While existing methods often suffer from the limitations of incomplete data, view-dependent effects, and regions where no texture was captured, our self-supervised approach enables a rich view synthesis, in view of not being supervised by the ground truth of the scene. Practical experiments demonstrate that SPSG outperforms previous methods in both the quality of the reconstructed scene and in the synthesis of novel views and scene completion tasks. The differentiable and perceptually consistent rendering of our system is critical for this self-supervision. We compare our results with a range of standard indoor scenes, demonstrating the improved visual quality and geometrical fidelity of our method, as well as the substantial improvement in computational efficiency."
