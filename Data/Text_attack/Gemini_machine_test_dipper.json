        " “Because there are many vital services, many lifelines, that if we are to close the libraries, cut back on social services, prevent children from receiving help—they are not mere figures on a budget, they are a death sentence for real people. The alternatives, Mr. Speaker, are the destruction of our communities,” said Senator Walsh, in a fervent tone, “and the injury is irreparable. But the costs of inaction, what are they? Certainly, setting an illegal budget carries risks. But what are the costs of inaction?” “We’ve seen the consequences of austerity before—the growing gap between rich and poor, the despair that follows. What is the moral cost of watching our cities and neighborhoods decline? “I don’t propose this lightly. I understand the gravity of the situation. But our duty is to protect the people of Liverpool. Let’s be clear: we are not setting an illegal budget simply for the sake of setting an illegal budget. We have a mandate to make a stand, even if it means we are acting against the dictates of power. The people of Liverpool have a right to see the government standing up for them, to say, ‘Enough is enough.’ They have a right to see the government resisting a system that values profit over people. Enough is enough, and the right of the people of Liverpool to act.” “We need to think carefully, we need to discuss the issues honestly. But let’s not be intimidated by the threat of legal action. Let’s not give in to fear.” “We need to remember who we represent: the people of Liverpool. What would they want us to do in this time of crisis? What would they want us to do?” “I believe they would want us to stand up and fight, I believe they would want us to consider every course of action, even if it means setting an illegal budget—if we need to do so to protect the vital services that our communities depend on.” “The time has come,” he said, he stopped, looked at the audience, his eyes full of conviction.for timidity is over. The time for action is now.\"",
        " ... But a deliberate ambiguity, a refusal to give us easy answers and a clear explanation, a story which... We have had to piece together, through fragments of conversation, a glance, an empty space, a pregnant silence, not with the broad words of kings and queens, but with the unspoken anxiety, the accumulated anger of people who live in their narrow spheres. The great events, the great dramas, lie in the unexpressed power relations, in the subtle reversals of control. Here the characters are skilful in their evasions, they speak round about the point, they circle it like wary predators; the soliloquies that enunciate the inner turmoil of their mind, show the great Shakespearean tradition. The comedy, too, is tinged with a dark undercurrent, an edge of sarcasm, which leaves us not sure whether we are laughing or shuddering. The setting, too, is like another character, a small, claustrophobic space, which creates the tension by pushing the characters into an uncomfortable proximity. Thus, perhaps, it is not Shakespeare’s grand story of love and betrayal, ambition and revenge, that we can compare this with; this is something smaller, more intimate, more disturbing. It is the comedy of the awkward, of the ridiculous attempts we make to deal with the complexities of human relationships. It is a world in which the most deadly weapon is not a sword, but a silence. It is a story of the power of silence, of the fragility of communication, of the cruelties that are inflicted in the name of relationships.",
        " Here are some of the best quotes we heard behind the scenes at the Royal Albert Hall: ‘Is that a Stradivarius? Don’t put your coffee on it, for God’s sake!’... Ok, here is a continuation in which different possible possibilities for the backstage situation at the Royal Albert Hall are being imagined: ‘The music of Stravinsky’s Quartet no. 2 has to be played in the tempo of a rapid snare drum’... (soprano warming up)... ‘L-a-aa... damn, my throat is dry, got some honey? Last time it was a train wreck, a beautiful, costly train wreck, but still a train wreck’... (the soprano), ‘Did you see the conductor’s face when the trombonist missed that note? Tomorrow my arms will kill me’... (the bassoonist)... ‘Where’s the glitter cannon? We need that!’... ‘I honestly think the acoustics in the loos are better than on stage tonight’... (the bassoonist) ‘Hey security, please keep the screaming crowds away from the dressing room door. I need five minutes to regain my composure. We can’t do it without the glitter cannon!’ (the bassoonist)... ‘Somebody spilt a beer on the program!’... ‘Did someone order a hundred pizzas?’ (the bassoonist)... ‘Does anyone else smell old body spray and hairspray here? Quick, someone write it down!’... (the bassoonist)... ‘Did you see what she was wearing? I must have a word with her dressmaker’... ‘You look great! But who’s your dressmaker?’... (The bassoonist)... ‘The whole thing was a total disaster!’...\"I heard *they're* having an affair. Can you believe it?\" * \"Quick, someone find me a safety pin! My dress is about to fall off.\" * \"I'm starving! Is there anything besides champagne and canapés?\" * \"And the award goes to... (muffled voice imitating presenter)... Oh please let it be me, please let it be me...\" **Scenario 4: A slightly more absurd, comedic take** Here are the best bits we heard backstage at the Royal Albert Hall in London: * \"Has anyone seen Kevin?

        " The attack, which took place in the early morning hours, resulted in a fierce firefight within the station, and, although the exact number of casualties has not yet been ascertained, the preliminary reports suggest that several policemen were killed and wounded. A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the ongoing investigation, explained that the infiltrator, believed to be a junior officer, managed to disconnect the surveillance cameras and unlocked a side gate of the station, where a small group of the militants managed to enter. Investigations have been launched at the highest level to determine the identity of the infiltrator and his accomplices. The incident has sparked widespread outrage and discontent among the security forces in Helmand Province, and questions have been raised as to the vetting process and the extent of future infiltrations. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack, and have linked it to their on-going offensive to capture the province. BBC has contacted the Ministry of the Interior for comment. The BBC is attempting to independently verify the police source’s comments, and awaiting official confirmation from the Ministry. The security situation in Lashkar Gah is already extremely fragile, and this latest attack is likely to result in even more disillusionment among the public.",
        " The PCS, the public service union which represents the strikers, claims that the proposed changes will leave them worse off in their retirement. The strike is expected to cause significant disruption at airports, ports and at the Eurostar stations throughout the United Kingdom. The strike is also taking place at a time when other industrial action is planned, which could exacerbate the situation. Other unions in various sectors are also threatening or have already announced industrial action, in a climate of industrial unrest. The government maintains that the changes are necessary to keep the public service pension schemes solvent and to bring them more in line with private sector pensions. However, delays and queues are expected. The authorities have put in place contingency plans to cope with the strike, deploying military personnel and volunteers to help with border control, but travellers are advised to contact their airline or travel operator for up-to-date information and to leave extra time for their journey. The government and the PCS are continuing to negotiate, but a settlement before the strike date is now unlikely.",
        " A stern warning has been issued to human beings, as these birds return to the breeding grounds along the coast. This was made in view of the rising number of humans attracted to the protected zones, and the unrestrained use of motor boats, off-road vehicles, and even drones. The environment ministry said that anyone who hurts, kills, or disturbs the Arctic terns may be prosecuted. The ministry has given clear guidelines on safe distances and responsible behaviour around the nesting sites. The ministry urged people to be mindful and to respect the birds and their natural habitat. It said that even accidental disturbances such as a visit to a nest or loud noise could be detrimental to the birds. In order to protect these sensitive birds, the ministry has increased its supervision and enforcement.",
        " “We are for human dignity and compassion,” the Minister said, “but the reorganization of marriage would upset the whole social structure. “This position is based on the idea that marriage, by its very definition, is a union between a man and a woman and is designed to be the union for the procreation and upbringing of children. In this sense, it is important to preserve the former role of the husband and wife in the family, in which the children can grow up in safety and have a stable environment in which to grow up. In this way, the Government will support policies that encourage marriage between a man and a woman and will support education and other forms of government support for such marriages, despite their good intentions. They say, despite their good intentions, that the Government is discriminating against gays and homosexuals. And they point to the fact that there is no research evidence that children who have grown up in gay marriages have been less harmed than those who have grown up in hetero-sexual marriages. They also challenged the very existence of the old idea that gender roles were essential for the well-being of children, pointing out that in the gay family the children were no worse off than in the hetero-sexual family. The public debate began with a great fury and revealed the deep divisions in the people about family values, religious beliefs and the changing concept of marriage in the 21st century.",
        " The Lancastria, a Cunarder, was overcrowded, exceeding its capacity of two thousand souls. It was sunk on the coast of Saint-Nazaire, France, in the course of Operation Aerial, during the evacuation of British troops and civilians after the Battle of France. It was a great hurry and a great violence. The Stukas pounded the ship, causing it to pitch and roll, with a fire in the hold. The Lancastria remains the greatest maritime disaster in the history of the United Kingdom, with a loss of life estimated at between three thousand and five thousand eight hundred. And the story of the disaster, suppressed by the British government, remained, for decades, very little known. The ship sank in minutes, hurling thousands into the oily waters of the Atlantic. The Lancastria is a designated war grave. Despite the great loss of life, the disaster of the Lancastria, less reported than other war tragedies, left the survivors and the relatives of the victims with the feeling that the memory of the victims had been forgotten. The fear was that the disclosure of such a disaster would cause a severe morale.",

What were they doing, I ask, what were they doing, who were the ‘they’ in the previous sentence, and what were they doing that led to the discovery of these people who were not Chibok girls? Okay, based on the information that the girls abducted from the Government Secondary School, Chibok, in April 2014, were not among them, I can go many different ways. But let me ask you one more thing, what was the consequence of these activities?” Here are some possibilities, depending on the missing information. “Option 1: They were found among a group of others rescued in a place in Chibok in April 2014. But they were not said to be the girls abducted from the Government Secondary School, Chibok, in April 2014. What’s the general context or tone you want to use? Is it a news report, a narrative, an analysis of historical facts, or what?” “Option 1a: The military is pledged to redouble its efforts, especially in intelligence gathering and liaising with local communities. The search has been renewed, with the military keenly interested in finding the rest of the abducted girls, despite their relief that they found some. At first, they were optimistic that they found some of the girls, but then verification showed that the rescued persons were different. Though the families of the Chibok girls are discouraged by this new development, the military emphasized that every person rescued is a victory in the war against the insurgency. “Option 1b: The military says the girls abducted from the Government Secondary School, Chibok, in April, 2014, were not found among the people found in the Chibok area, but it added that the search continues in the area, and that the military will not stop until the girls are found.” “Option 2: The military says they are from a place in Chibok, but not from the Government Secondary School, Chibok. “Option 3: The military says they are from a place in Chibok, but not from the school where the girls were abducted in April, 2014. If you give me more context, I will write for you the most appropriate and relevant continuation.” “And please, give me more context so that I will know what’s the most appropriate and helpful continuation.”",
        " ... The festival organisers, in close contact with the police of the county, instituted an all-embracing security plan. Although the mood in the camp was still very much one of high spirits and celebration, a very visible reminder of the presence of security personnel, which was a reassurance for the visitors and a deterrent against any potential problems. In the course of the day the visitors expressed a mixed impression. The visible security measures were more frequent searches of rucksacks, dog patrols on the perimeter and a more thorough system of camera surveillance. Plainclothes policemen also mingled with the crowd, providing an extra layer of security. “It’s a bit of a fright to see guns like that,” said a young woman from Nottingham. Others found it unnerving, a complete contrast to the carefree festival atmosphere. But others also found it reassuring and grateful for the additional security, believing that they could enjoy the music more freely. The police stressed that their presence was essentially preventive. “But to be honest, after what happened in Manchester, I would prefer them to be here, as long as they take it seriously.” Despite the underlying tension, the music went on. The police were encouraging the visitors to remain vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour, and they also pointed out the importance of community co-operation in preserving the peace. In the hope that Donington Park could be a haven, a place where people could meet and celebrate together in the face of danger, the mood of the music and the fellowship of the audience – this was what made the festival a true community festival. The musicians took to the stage and, as they delivered a powerful performance, swept the audience away from the anxieties of the outside world for a while.",
        " The following description is that of Cystic Fibrosis. It is a hereditary disease affecting the cells that produce mucus, sweat, and digestive juices. The mucus causes the lungs to weaken and collapse, thereby opening the way for the introduction of infection. The mucus gets trapped in the lungs, and thus infection, chronic inflammation, and irreparable lung damage follow. Normally the secretions are thin and easily removed. In CF the defective gene makes them thick and sticky. Also, the mucus can block the ducts in the pancreas, thus preventing the digestive juices from getting to the intestines. Hence malnutrition and mal-absorption. In time, this can lead to lung failure. * Airway clearance techniques: these are devices to loosen and remove the mucus from the lungs. * Inhaled medication: bronchodilators to open the airways, mucolytics to loosen the mucus, and antibiotics to fight infection. * Chemotherapy: drugs to stimulate the growth of the cells that line the lungs. * Intestinal or gastrointestinal (GI) therapy. * Pancreatic enzymes: these help digestion and nutrient absorption. * Nutrient supplementation: this is a high-fat diet, to compensate for the lack of fat-soluble vitamins. * Lung transplantation: a last resort, for people with severe lung disease. * Early diagnosis and comprehensive management are vital for the survival and quality of life of people with CF. * CFTR modulator therapies: these are drugs to correct the underlying genetic defect and to improve lung function and general health in some people with certain CF mutations.",
        " At the first opinion the club physicians were sanguine and stated that within four or six months he would be playing again, a much shorter time than was originally feared. The player's leg was broken in a rather innocuous collision with the English winger Raheem Sterling, but he will not undergo a surgical operation. He will be put in a plaster cast and be given physiotherapy. 'The news of a blow to the team has come with all the force of the English press,' said the coach Gareth Southgate, and at the same time he said that it was a great relief to know that there would be no operation, that the player was strong and would devote himself to his rehabilitation. The winger Raheem was said to be shaken by the collision and apologized immediately to his colleague, and the two of them have talked to each other and have confirmed their friendship and commitment to the team. The collision occurred in a training session, a harmless collision, which, unfortunately, caused a fracture. The coach is not afraid of the fact that the team is thin, he trusts the strength of his squad and believes that other players will be able to play. It is obvious that the absence of the midfield player who is so influential will be missed in the next matches. The team must now find ways to compensate for this absence and not let the team lose momentum in the league.",

He admitted in an interview that he had not really expected the call from the president-elect. He explained that he had spent his whole career in the energy business, dealing with complex deals and managing vast operations, and although he considered himself a skilled negotiator and planner, he understood the skepticism surrounding his appointment. The prospect of running the State Department seemed to him like a leap into another dimension. He paused and reflected on the following storm. \"I knew they would question my lack of diplomatic experience,\" he said, \"and I thought it was fair. It was a steep learning curve.\" He added, with a smile, \"It is true that my oil business days were over. I had to quickly get a handle on a great deal of knowledge, get to know the career diplomats, and learn the finer points of international diplomacy.

He said that the name of the players and the particular match could not be disclosed, owing to the investigations being carried out by the ICC. He said that it was necessary to maintain the integrity of the game and commended the players for coming forward to report the incident. “We support the ICC in its investigations and are willing to cooperate with them to bring the culprits to justice,” he said. The minister made these comments at a time when there was growing concern among the cricketing fraternity about the nefarious activities of some cricketers, both at home and abroad. He said that the importance of educating the players about the dangers of such attempts and the proper way to report such incidents should be commended. He said that it showed the dedication of these players towards the game.

With six wickets and a considerable number of overs to spare, England reached their target with six wickets in hand. The West Indies bowlers could not put sustained pressure on the English batswomen.

        " In this sparsely populated area the discarded gas-pouches screamed of some deliberate act. The situation was clearly an accident. At the junction of Cumson’s Lane and Tullygeasy Road a few packages of fuel were lying on the ground. A host of possibilities rushed through the minds of all who chanced to pass. The question was not, who had forgotten them? It was who had abandoned them, and why? Was it a warning, a signal, a forewarning of something more sinister in the making? Were they the remnants of a rendezvous, or a secret rendezvous for some nefarious purpose? Or had they been stolen, and then discarded because they were too hot to handle? The package numbers had been carefully scratched out. This was evidence of premeditation. The gas-pouches were of a common type, destined for the use of tractors and heavy vehicles. But there was little else to be gleaned from the scene itself. The discovery was quickly reported, and the police, whose number was small, arrived to cordon off the area and open an investigation. There were no obvious tyre-marks or foot-tracks. There was nothing but the usual dusty, gravelly surface of the country-road. In the locality, used to the slow rhythms of rural life, the slow moods of the natural world were disturbed. Something was afoot, and they hoped that it would not affect their quiet existence.

        " The case before District Judge Barney McElholm met its first hurdle when James Moore, of Tullymore Road, appeared before him without appearing in court. He was cited on Friday, for a swindle involving the use of a motor car without insurance, without tax and without an authorised driver. In his plea, his solicitor, a local man, said that Moore was undergoing treatment for serious mental illness, that he was suffering from depression, and that he was in receipt of mental health care. The solicitor said that Moore had given them his oath that he was going to attend court and he was asking for an adjournment. This prompted Sergeant David Armstrong, prosecuting, to ask for a severe order on Moore, and for the assurance that he would not drive during this time. On considering both sides of the argument, Judge McElholm granted an adjournment until... a date two weeks later. “I am fully aware of the dangers of these crimes,” he said, “but it is important to get at the root cause of Mr Moore’s behaviour. The order I make is that Mr Moore hand in his provisional driving licence to the police at once, and that he not operate any motor vehicle on any public road. Failure to do this will result in a warrant for his arrest.” He then addressed the solicitor: “Please do everything in your power to persuade Mr Moore to conform to these conditions. He needs to focus on his mental health and cooperate with the authorities. At the next hearing I expect to see evidence of his engagement with the mental health authorities.” The case was adjourned until... a date two weeks later.",
        " An extraordinary goal was scored by Mario Gaspar from a perfect overhead pass; it found its way into the top corner, and the goal was replayed from every angle on the big screen, each of them more entrancing than the last. The atmosphere of the stadium exploded; a wave of red and yellow flags; it was the goal of the Alicante defender Mario Gaspar. This was not a final. The joy was tempered by a vague dread: it was not a one-sided game. Even the resolute Del Bosque let a faint smile glide across his face. The score-line, 1-0, reflected the possession of the ball and not the overall picture. It was not a qualifying match, it was a friendly against an unambitious, but unforgiving Ukraine. It was not easy to break down their deep defence. Their goalkeeper, Denys Boyko, was having a marvellous game, saving Spain’s forwards with some astonishing saves. Spain’s passing was precise, their movement fluid, but the precision of execution, that quicksilver touch that had marked their golden period, seemed to be missing. In the second half it began as it had in the first: possession was on the side of Spain, but the chances came and went. Del Bosque began to make some changes; he wanted fresh legs, new ideas. Andres Iniesta was a magician in the centre of the field, but the final pass often lacked precision. The Ukraine sensed an opportunity and pressed higher up the pitch, disrupting Spain’s rhythm. The substitutes made a difference, and the score remained the same. Paco Alcacer, who came on for Diego Costa, brought impetus to the attack; Koke brought strength and imagination to the centre. The final whistle blew, confirming a narrow 1-0 win for Spain. There were a few moments of trepidation: Gerard Pique made two or three crucial interceptions. Eventually, Mario Gaspar’s moment of genius proved decisive. But it was not an overwhelming win. There was still much to be done if Del Bosque was to regain the glory of years gone by.there, the talent was undeniable, but the spark, the ruthlessness, that had made them champions, still needed to be rekindled. The road to France, and the next European Championship, was long and winding, and this performance, while aesthetically pleasing at times, served as a reminder of the challenges that lay ahead.",
        " The measures to be introduced are mainly on the legal side, and the government is exploring ways of tightening residence requirements and interpreting existing regulations more strictly. One of the measures to be introduced is to increase the minimum period of residence required for claiming certain benefits, bringing it in line with the rules for other foreign nationals. The government is looking for ways to limit access to benefits, health and housing for Romanians and Bulgarians after the lifting of restrictions on the free movement of workers. Also under consideration are ways of preventing an overloading of social housing, and concerns have been raised about establishing priorities for long-term residents and those with a proven local connection. The government is looking carefully at the rules under the European treaties and international agreements to make sure that any measures are consistent with the law and are not discriminatory against the Romanian and Bulgarians. The question of benefit tourism is also being looked at and ministers are considering ways of ensuring that people who are applying for social support have an economic motive. Also, some of the Romanians and Bulgarians are able to contribute to the economy, especially in labour-short sectors. However, the critics point out that such measures could be discriminatory and counter-productive, and might drive people into the shadow economy and cause even more social problems.",

        " Regulation, on the other hand, is expected to involve setting standards of practice and setting guidelines, ensuring the quality of services and providing a framework for accountability. The registration process is expected to aim at establishing a recognised level of competence and ethics for people working in the youth and employment sector. This broader scope of responsibilities represents a significant shift towards the professionalization of youth work and employment. It is therefore to be expected that the regulatory body will have to develop the following instruments:  Clear criteria for registration: Define the qualifications, experience and competences that are necessary for a person to be registered as a youth support worker or a worker in the field of work. This could include several levels of registration depending on qualifications and experience.  Clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Rules of conduct and professional practice: define the framework for professional conduct and the guidelines for working with young people and learners. Training and development guidelines: identify the appropriate opportunities for training and professional development for the benefit of the field of youth work and work. Training and development systems: determine and promote appropriate training and professional development opportunities so that workers have the knowledge and skills required. Development of communication and engagement strategies: develop strategies to inform and involve workers, employers and the public in the registration and regulation process. Development of supervision and control mechanisms: develop procedures to monitor compliance with regulations and to respond to complaints or concerns about the conduct of workers, possibly including investigations, disciplinary hearings and sanctions. The new task is therefore expected to involve significant resources and considerable expertise to be able to fulfil this task properly.

        " The backdrop of the first campaign rally of Mitt Romney in Ohio today is the artful expression of pure, industrial virtue, Made in the USA. Behind the podium is a simple, clear, industrial grid of shiny steel beams, like the soaring rafters of an old mill. The word is ‘JOBS’. The message is clear: Mitt Romney will bring back the good old days, when Ohioans built America. The audience is receptive, and the puffed-up crowd in its blue shirts and worn denim is nodding along, responding with heads nodding and voices chanting a familiar speech. The main focus is the word, ‘JOBS’, a bold and steady reminder of the issue at hand. Mitt speaks of tax cuts, deregulation and unleashing the power of the American entrepreneur. But the words are almost secondary to the image, the slogan, in fact. An almost imperceptible crack in the paint of the podium is a reminder of the many years of political battles fought on these same fields. On closer inspection, though, there is a tiny imperfection in the carefully constructed facade: a slight smudge on one of the steel beams, perhaps a fingerprint, a reminder of the ground that is not always clean. The image of a revived economy is not always so slick; the picture is not so clear. And in Ohio, where promises have often been broken, reality is a powerful fact. These tiny imperfections are a kind of mute counterpoint to the hopeful speech.",

        " Deeply moved by a sincere respect for the dead, and actuated by the most accurate of research, a group of aviators and archaeologists from Queen's University in Belfast set out on an ambitious excavation. It was supposed that the Irish Army had removed all the wreckage from the hill, but a group of aviation historians and archaeologists from Queen's University in Belfast believed otherwise. They felt a strong desire to search for it, and under the burden of the consciousness of disturbing a battlefield, they acted with great delicacy and discretion. They conducted the first investigation, with the help of ground-penetrating radar and metal detectors. The initial researches were promising. Beneath the surface, a kind of slat-like metal debris was observed. Deeper excavations were begun. First appeared twisted, corroded aluminum pieces. The peat, carefully preserved by the acid of the bog, yielded its secrets slowly. It was clear that the wreckage was much more extensive than anyone had thought. Then came larger pieces, the skin of the airplane, still with the faint remnants of camouflage paint. Each piece was meticulously recorded, carefully marked, classified and described. Among the debris were also personal objects, a battered leather glove, a shattered compass, uniform buttons. Every object, however small, spoke of the lost lives and the last moments of the crash. They knew that under the soil, in the pits and depressions, the bodies of the airmen lay, and they were determined to honor their sacrifice. The work was arduous, the investigations often interrupted by the unpredictable Irish weather, but the persistent hope of further evidence and the completeness of the history of the lost Stirling and its crew gave them the strength to continue.",

The decision to request the dissolution of the National Revolutionary Youths is expected to provoke a reaction on both sides of the political divide. [An elaboration of the above by a spokesman for the Prime Minister or the Minister for the Interior, in the following terms: ‘The government will not tolerate the actions of groups that are a threat to the Republic’s values and the safety of its citizens.

        " Gillian had been one of the constant presences in their lives, a shoulder to cry on, a child-sitter on call, and a fellow conspirator in the daily adventures and misadventures of raising children. The bond between Gillian and Rachel had been forged in the crucible of their common motherhood, the long chats late at night over cheap wine, the understanding of the way a mother looks after a child. Gillian had fallen out with Rachel and Nyomi before the little girl’s death, but had been a great friend of theirs for many years. She had seen Rachel, the quiet, more introspective one, blossom under the weight of her role as mother, her eyes softening and her love for the children seeming to radiate out from her. She remembered countless afternoons in their brightly coloured, chaotic sitting-room, surrounded by toys and the infectious laughter of children. Though the falling out was recent and painful, it was overshadowed by the horrible spectre of what was to come. Gillian was tormented by memories of those happy days. She could not reconcile the women she had known, the women she had shared so many intimate moments with, with the monstrous accusations now circling around them. Had she missed something, had she not seen the signs? Had she been too blind to them? She replayed the last time she had seen them in her mind’s eye, trying to see some sign of the darkness that now enveloped them. How could she have been so close to them, so entangled in their lives, and not seen the evil that was brewing under the surface? The thought was a gnawing one, a constant, insidious snarl that would not be silenced. For the sake of the child, for the sake of her own peace of mind, she had to face the terrible truth, even though it meant shattering the illusion of the woman she had thought she knew. She had to cooperate with the police and tell them everything, however painful that was.",

Dwayne Kinner, who had lain down beside Nicholas Roberts, leapt up. His body was swimming with the flood of the new stimulant. The air in the little Kirkcaldy sitting-room thickened in an instant, and the suffocating roar of the set replaced the quiet background hum of the radio. “What the devil is this!” Dwayne exclaimed. The pistol, clutched in the foreman’s hand, was the terrible silent threat that silenced his exclamation. The mangled machete reflected the harsh flames of the little electric heater. The foreman, a thickset fellow with a crudely traced tattoo on his neck, said nothing. He just jerked the gun towards the corner. Nicholas managed to croak something, his eyes wide with the fear that was tearing his courage to pieces. “Get the hell into the corner, both of you, right away!” the foreman roared. Dwayne felt an instant of fury, despite his terror. This was his home. The foreman’s voice sounded deep and growling, with a vaguely Scottish accent, which Dwayne seemed to recognize, but could not place. “Who the hell are you?” he shouted, “You in the corner! Who the hell do you think you are?” He would not lie down and give in. “What do you think you are doing?” the stout fellow laughed, short and humourless. “You know damn well what we want. What do you want?” He took a step forward, his pistol still levelled. “Don’t play dumb with us. Get the hell into the corner, right away.” Dwayne had a feeling that this would be the end of his argument. He did not want to put his cousin in more danger. He looked at Nicholas, who was pale and trembling, and decided that he had to do as the men said. The other two, masked and silent, moved swiftly about the room, rifling through the drawers and the cupboards. One of them hurriedly threw everything he found into the corner. Slowly, reluctantly, he crept towards the wall, his cousin at his side. “Now then, Dwayne,” the foreman said, glaring at him. The other, standing at the door, still held the crowbar ready.into Dwayne's. \"Where is it?\" Dwayne swallowed hard. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" He tried to sound confident, but his voice wavered. The burly man's lips curled into a sneer. \"Don't lie to me, Dwayne. We know you have it. The money. Where is it?\" He pressed the gun a little harder, the cold metal a chilling reminder of the stakes. Dwayne's mind raced. He knew exactly what they were talking about. The money from the... the deal. He'd hidden it well, he thought. But clearly, someone had talked. He was trapped, caught in a web of his own making. He looked at Nicholas, his face etched with fear, and knew he had to protect him. \"Okay, okay,\" Dwayne",

        " With each victory his confidence grew, he refined his tactics and improved his reactions. He still had the sting of his first race, and the dangers of the track. Despite this setback, he felt his course changing. The tension was growing as the season neared its end. He scrutinized each race, his own and his adversaries'; he learned to foresee his adversaries' moves, to seek out their weak points, to push his own machine to the extreme without crossing the dangerous boundary between enthusiasm and madness. He knew that despite his seven victories, the title was far from assured. The whispering in the team-room grew more feverish, the camera flashes more frequent. He ignored them, fixed his gaze on the track before him. Race eleven came, a long endurance test on a circuit which was known to be arduous. In the first laps, he jostled with the other drivers for the lead. A single lapse, a mechanical failure, or a shrewd manoeuvre on the part of an adversary, could deprive him of victory. He bit his lips, drove harder than ever, ruthlessly tearing up his rivals one by one. But in the middle of the race, one of his tyres began to wear, he had to go in for an early change. He came out of the pits several places behind, the title in danger of slipping from his grasp. But he did not panic; he gathered momentum, saw the opportunity for a final manoeuvre on the last bend, a hair-pin. As the last lap approached, he was second, and catching up with the leader, an experienced man whose game was more resolute. The crowd roared, and with the greatest caution, he moved into second place, inching closer and closer to the man ahead of him. Then, without a moment's hesitation, without a moment's hesitation, he dashed through the hair-pin, without a moment's hesitation, at full throttle. He took the lead at the bend, which the leader missed, thereby giving him a few metres advantage, and thus a perfect position for the final race. The tension was unbearable, the stakes were higher than ever. Now there was only one last race, and the title was his. That last race would determine his career, perhaps even his reputation.",

There were no further cuts to cultural services or library books. There were no further increases in the prices of car parks.

The local council also decided to seek funds from national and international sources for special projects and local initiatives.",
        " Those who fought on the side of independence made their case by the usual arguments, but they were not at all less persuasive for being old-fashioned. To some, those six words were the clearest, the most logical path imaginable, an escape from injustice, the opportunity to forge a nation in their own image. They said that under Scottish rule, the most urgent of issues could be solved, that we could, for example, eliminate the enduring friction of nuclear weapons on Scottish soil. North Sea oil, they said, had been squandered under Westminster control. Social policy would thrive under government more in tune with Scottish values. They saw a diminished Scotland, a country left adrift in the storm of the world, the risks were greater than the rewards. But to others, those same six words conjured up a very different vision: uncertainty, economic instability, the breaking of long-established bonds. The joint United Kingdom security was too valuable to discard lightly, the cross-border ties of family and culture too precious to sever. The economic interdependence of the United Kingdom was too deeply rooted to unravel without great pain. The potential pain and the potential gain both seemed to them disproportionate. And for those who were caught in the middle, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of both sides, they saw the attractions of both sides. On their shoulders rested the weight of history, the future of their children, the identity of their nation. The six words were not a declaration of intent, but a gateway to a world of possibilities, thrilling and terrifying.",
        " He spoke of massive corruption, of misappropriation of the funds meant for public health, for education, for the roads. He promised to create a task force of impartial investigators, with the sole mission of retracing these funds, exposing the guilty, and prosecuting the culprits. He promised to retrieve billions of dollars that were “stolen” by the previous administrations, and to pursue them relentlessly. He paused, and let the roar of applause and the murmur of the crowd subsist for a moment; then he added a note of solemn determination. “This is not a political matter,” he said, but there were murmurs in the air, hints of accusations. The crowd responded with enthusiasm, with anger, with pent-up frustration and distrust. “This is a matter of righting a wrong. We will turn over every stone and no one will be spared. The perpetrators, no matter how powerful, will be prosecuted.” His speech ended with a call to action, with an invitation for the public to come forward with information, with promises of anonymity and of a reward. He then went on to outline the suspected means of corruption, referring to inflated contracts, confiscated lands, and shady financial dealings. There was no proof of this, but the implication was clear: the corruption had existed all along, and he alone had the courage to take action against it. And then came the question: would he live up to his promises, or would he use the whole affair as yet another political maneuver to stifle his political opponents? Had he already started a campaign against the country’s enemies, his own political enemies, namely the gangsters, the politicians, the cronies, the local cronies of the tycoons, and the oligarchs, or was this just a political ploy to neutralize his opponents?",
        " And it was in this connection that he questioned the recent government emphasis on British values, asking what they were and what their practical consequences might be. What are British values, he asked, and whose were they? “British values are ill-defined and open to misinterpretation,” said the headmaster of Southend. “Are they queueing politely? Drinking tea?” he asked, at a local education conference. “A stiff upper lip? These are stereotypes, not the basis of a cohesive society. And if we try to codify them, we run the risk of excluding those who do not conform to a narrow and often outdated definition of ‘Britishness’.” Who decides what counts as a ‘British value’ and who is to decide whether a teacher or a pupil is living up to it? “In this way, the English values system runs the risk of excluding those who are different from the received wisdom, which would threaten the freedom of thought and expression that education is intended to foster.” Rather than imposing a set of nationalist ideas on our young, he said, we should be encouraging them to think for themselves and to contribute to a society that welcomes diversity and encourages critical thinking. Universal values such as respect, tolerance, compassion and critical thinking are the way forward, he argued, allowing for a greater diversity of ideas and a more rigorous and inclusive way of encouraging responsible and engaged citizens.",
        " The manoeuvre itself was a gem, a testimony to the industry and discipline instilled by Sarah Jenkins, the manager. Turgott was at once engulfed in a sea of green and white, but emerged from it a few seconds later, smeared from head to foot with the grin of a fool, his shirt pulled halfway up his chest. The roar that arose from the Trinity throng was deafening, the outburst of all the energy which had been pent up for ninety minutes. Then came the goal. The ball had been passed out to the wing by the expert Liam O’Connell, who, a player of great style, ran it into the path of the wing-back Chloe Davies, who, with a pass of artistry, slipped past her man, got the defenders on the move, then rolled the ball to the wing-back, an improvising and restless cross which just evaded the outstretched leg of the central defender. The player on the ground was Turgott. Without breaking stride, he guided the ball with the help of a slight adjustment of body and a deft touch with his boot into the bottom corner. Immediately the goal swelled the net, the ecstatic, triumphant cheers rang out on Grange Lane. A moment later the final whistle was blown, confirming the score, 0-1. The keeper, rooted to the ground, could do nothing but watch as the goal swelled. It was not just three points, but a statement. A pensive, subdued, unrelenting satisfaction filled the woman’s face, as she threw her arm around her assistant. Turgott, the hero of the hour, took a moment to savour the satisfaction of his adulation, the joy of his team-mates, the gratification of victory. It was a statement that the Trinity team was something, that it could play its part even when things were not going its way. He had scored, had kept the three points, had ended the losing run. But for now, things were perfect. He was well aware that it was just one match, one moment.the win, and the roar of Grange Lane would echo in his ears for nights to come.",
        " He has been a pillar of the Chelsea defence, and has earned for himself five league titles, five FA Cups, a Champions’ league and a UEFA Cup. Though his playing time has been in decline recently, his experience and leadership have been an invaluable asset to the team. The former England captain, who will be 36 in August, will leave the current English champions at the end of the season, bringing to a close a 22-year career at Stamford Bridge. And he has hinted that he might even consider a career in coaching. With a string of offers, both from English and foreign clubs, to choose from, he is considering his next move.",
        " The opponents, who were in danger of relegation, defended with the energy that astonished in view of their position. Their goalkeeper, a comparative newcomer, did a series of fine saves which thwarted the efforts of the champions. The score remained surprisingly narrow, at 3-2, until the last minute of the game. A penalty kick, which the substitute Anya Petrova calmly converted, brought the game to a conclusion. The victory was thus affirmed, but a certain respect for the outsiders who had taken the treble-winners to the limit. The final whistle released a wave of relief and acclamation, and of satisfaction that the challengers had played the treble-winners as hard as any of them had ever been played. There was a general feeling of anxiety and hope, mixed with the hope of the home supporters and the cynicism of the visitors.",

        " In the Dominican Republic, they find themselves in agriculture, in the building trades, in the domiciliation of the people, in the laundry trades, in the service of families, in occupations which the Dominicans often refuse to perform. For a long time past, there has been a large migration of Haitians to the Dominican Republic, who, for lack of work and bread, have gone over to that country in large numbers, and without papers. It is a question of a very considerable proportion of the population of the Dominican Republic, and the influx of the Haitians is a source of considerable social and political disturbance. There are some districts of the country where the competition of the Haitians is so keen, that their salaries are depressed, and the lower classes of society refuse to receive them. It is a question, for the Haitians, of both opportunity and weakness. The government of the Dominican Republic has resorted to various means for regulating the population of the country, and has even made deportations in masses, which have been much criticized by the humane associations, for their severity and want of due process of law. The insecurity of the status of many of these Haitian emigrants leaves them exposed to abuse, and deprives them of many of their civil rights. The historical relations between the two countries, which have been complicated by successive military conflicts, the unresolved frontier, and the resultant animosity of the peoples, aggravate the conditions of the Haitians. The hopes of work and better fortune attract them, but they are often harassed by the threats of deportation. The way to a true solution of the question is a gradual one, the tasks of which must be assimilated into one single whole, a way which attacks the cause of migration in Haiti, by promoting just and fair conditions of labour in the Dominican Republic, and by promoting the rapprochement and understanding of the two countries. Historical enmities have lent a certain colouring to the present relations of the two countries, and have contributed to the difficulties of regulating migration and maintaining peaceful relations.",
        " For days there had been no sound save the scraping of metal, the rustling of debris, and the shouts of the searchers. Now, as a moaning, under-respiratory wind, the dying cries of the people had risen from the ruins of the factory. The silence that followed was a heavy suffocation. The men, hardened by the stern labour and the threat of collapse, exchanged worried glances. Now, this. Did... did anyone hear that? His throat twitched nervously. It was Miller, the youngest of the team, who was most distraught. He was shaking and his voice was barely a whisper. ‘What was it, Miller?’ The macho voice of Callahan cut the tension. ‘No, sir. Wind? Rats?’ Miller waved towards the chaos of twisted steel and crushed concrete, the former heart of the factory. ‘It was like a moan. It was muffled and it came from the rubble.’ ‘Rats, Miller. Just rats.’ Callahan, with his practical pragmatism, sneered. But the sound had been the seed of fear. ‘Let’s get back to work. We’re wasting time.’ They recommenced the excavation, the air thick with dust and the smell of rotting material. The howling wind kept up its funeral song, echoing the invisible moan. They were moving more slowly now, ears twitching, eyes nervously roving across the debris. Then Miller heard it again, this time louder and closer. The metallic smell of blood was palpable. ‘It came again,’ he said, his shovel falling to the ground. ‘It was like an elongated moan. It came from inside the rubble.’! I swear, I heard it!\" Callahan, his patience wearing thin, finally relented. He held up a hand, silencing the team. \"Alright, alright. Everyone quiet. Let's listen.\" The only sound was the wind, but as it died down, a faint, almost imperceptible sound emerged from the depths of the debris. A low, rhythmic thumping, like a slow, failing heartbeat. Callahan's face paled. He'd heard that sound before, in the aftermath of other disasters. It was the sound of someone trapped, barely clinging to life. \"Get the thermal imaging camera,\" he barked, his voice tight with urgency. \"Now! And someone call for backup. We're not dealing with rats here.\" The hunt had just taken a terrifying turn. The",

        " A mint Luke Skywalker, with a double-telescoping lightsaber, the subject of many a wish list, was running along the table, a rare object of devotion. Beneath the gentle glow of the glass of the cabinet were fifteen treasures, indicating a lifelong passion for collecting. He wasn’t expecting a hundred-thousand-dollar payday, but even half of that, or a quarter of that, would be a financial windfall. He knew that the occurrence of the $100,000 Boba Fett was a quirk, the combination of rarity, condition, and the frenzy of the buyer. He knew the subtleties, the slight differences in the mold, the subtle differences in color that could make a big difference. He studied every one of them with a lot of care, spending hours on collector's forums, in auction records and price guides, he knew the details, the nuances, the subtle changes in color, which made a big difference in value. He had been saving for years, with the hope of finally buying a small apartment, a flat, to escape the cramped, treasure-filled bedroom in the house of his parents. This was it. He breathed in deeply, filled with the smell of aging plastic and cardboard. He didn't sell toys, he sold history, nostalgia, a piece of a distant galaxy. He started with Luke Skywalker, photographed him carefully from all sides, emphasizing the perfect condition of the doll, wrote a detailed description of rarity and provenance. It was time to unleash his next collection. He put it on Ebay, setting a high opening bid, confident in the item's interest.

But Bath finally managed to score, reducing the deficit and giving new hope to the fight for victory. A penalty by Burns added three more points to the tally, and then it was all-out. Then the Gloucester team got a turn-over deep in their own half, which eased the pressure and gave them a little more breathing space before the final whistle. As the clock ran down, the tension increased; each scrum, each line-out, each tackle was fiercely contested. The final whistle came, confirming the well-earned victory of the home team.

        " He was huddled up in a small box, shivering despite the hasty cloak someone had tucked over him. His tiny, intelligent eyes moved about anxiously, taking in the clean smell of disinfectant and the tall figures of the policemen. On Monday the police had found the last of the family, a male marmoset, which they had abandoned on the threshold of a veterinarian's office. “Poor little fellow,” Lieutenant Miller murmured in a deep voice, “looks half-frightened.” He was a stout, quiet man, with a surprising fondness for animals. The case had created a sensation on the local news, and all the public speculatively pondered the origins of the family, their escape, and their sudden disappearance. And when Gomez was found, the case grew in interest, especially as it was established that he was indeed the last of the marmosets. “He's been well looked after, up to now,” said the veterinarian, Anya Sharma, gently feeling his velvety head. He was a little undernourished and a little depressed, but he was otherwise healthy. “It looks as though he's used to being handled.” Even as Gomez was being examined, the wheels of the investigation were already turning. Detective Inspector Davies, an experienced investigator who had a flair for seeing connections where none could be seen, was convinced that the marmosets weren't just stray pets. “Check the security cameras at the veterinarian's,” he instructed his men, “and examine the box for any fingerprints.” There was something besides the fluffy, innocent appearances that sat above the story. Gomez, settling into his temporary home, a cage with enrichment toys and climbing branches, was still on his guard, he missed his family and the warm, familiar touch of their bodies against his. “Someone has left him there and they might have left a trace.” While Detective Inspector Davies squinted at the blurred security film from a nearby shop, a cloaked figure walked out of the room. Gomez didn't understand why they had vanished, why everything was so cold and unfamiliar.in shadow, hurried away from the vet's office just hours before Gomez was discovered. The figure was obscured, their face hidden by a hood, but Davies noticed something peculiar: a distinct limp. \"That's our guy,\" he muttered, a flicker of excitement in his eyes. \"Or girl. And that limp... I think I know someone with a limp like that.\" He leaned back in his chair, the image of the hooded figure burned into his mind. The 'Marmoset Mafia' case was far from closed. In fact, it was just beginning to unravel.",
        " The fire, which broke out late in the evening, caused extensive damage to the building, which was visible from several miles away. Firemen used several hoses and their breathing apparatus to extinguish the blaze, which was visible for several miles. The fire-fighters, who were in action through the night, said that they found it extremely difficult to extinguish the fire, owing to the arduous nature of the work. Newbridge Road, which was closed at one point, was opened again after a short time. The smoke from the fire caused the windows of nearby houses to be closed and local residents were advised to close their doors and windows. The cause of the fire is not yet known and is the subject of an investigation. No one was hurt.",
        " One of the best known and longest established firms in the industry, Nelsons of Preston, in Lancashire, have made forty employees redundant. The company’s explanation was that the rising cost of raw materials and the growing competition from abroad made it unviable to continue as before. Trade unionists were outraged at this decision and blamed the company for putting profit before people. The downsizing of the company is expected to have a serious effect on the local economy of the district, where the factory has been an important employer for years. There is concern among the local shops, which fear a fall in the amount of trade, and the local council has pledged to help the redundancies. Having already discussed with the management terms of redundancy pay and retraining for those affected, they are now in negotiations about the future employment of the workers concerned. However, many of the redundant workers are anxious about their prospects of finding comparable work in the current job market. The management has promised to provide assistance and guidance in finding new employment. The future of the firm is uncertain and the local people are facing the prospect of prolonged unemployment. This is yet another reminder of the difficulties facing the manufacturing industries in Britain and raises the question of the need for government intervention in order to protect jobs and help local economies.",

The fall often proves fatal, a psychological dent which is difficult to erase. They have been surprised in their first round; it is as if they were thrown off their feet. The shock is felt by the whole squad, which is shattered by the shock, which upsets the game plans, and sets in motion an internal doubt. These are exceptions, but they are rare exceptions, they are celebrated precisely because they defy the usual trend. Exceptions which demonstrate the invincible and the strategic genius. So Scotland is faced with a difficult uphill struggle, with a formidable challenge, which will put to the test the resolve and the ability to learn from initial failure. Often, this first defeat, after the blow of ambition, is a shadow which has long lingered, and is a recurrent reminder of the hardness of knockout competitions.",
        " And yet further analysis would be necessary to establish the full extent of these changes, for example, the length of stay in the IC unit. Would the increased throughput have been at the cost of shorter stays, with earlier discharges? – The severity of illness: Had the patients in 2014–15 been less seriously ill than in 2011–12, and had they been more readily discharged to the wards? – The readmission rates: Had the readmissions to the IC unit risen or fallen between 2011–12 and 2014–15? – The mortality on the ward after discharge from the IC unit: Had it changed significantly between the two periods? – The reasons for the increase in the numbers of patients: Without consideration of these factors, it is difficult to determine whether the increased discharges to the wards and the increased number of patients admitted to the IC unit represented a positive trend in the management of critical care. – The resources on the wards: Were the wards equipped to cope with the increased numbers of patients discharged from the IC unit, and were there sufficient staff to deal with them?",
        " The written script was gone; never mind that it was not a tactical masterclass, a measured approach, or the much-needed clinical finishing. It was a victory forged in the crucible of adversity, a victory snatched from the jaws of defeat, the outcome of a raw, almost primitive desire to make a statement. If the script had been written as a pre-emptive response to the early, indifferent goal, one could have expected it to unfold in the old way: heads down, shoulders slumped, the moans of the traveling support rising, as if by magic to meet the crushing blow of defeat. But something changed. It was not just a goal, it was a statement. The equalizer, a thunderous volley from a player whose self-confidence had been chipped away as though it were a cliff of a seaside coast, was as unexpected as it was spectacular. A fire burned in the eyes of those who had been hiding in the shadows. And from there the unexpected continued: a clumsy, almost reckless change in tactics, with players thrown forward at the risk of losing their place, forced an overload on the Everton midfield. A statement that, despite all the doubts and criticisms, the team still had the spirit and quality to compete. Not the sleek, controlled, predictable team of old. It was something else. The winning goal, a frenzied scramble in the penalty area, was far from perfect, but it showed the determination and the sheer belief. The road ahead remained rocky, but the unexpected victory offered a ray of hope that the script might be rewritten. It was a team that had been on the edge and found a way back; a team that was prepared to win ugly, but win it they did; a team that, for one day at least, had found its heart.",
        " During the last year, a successful IT specialist, Barry, a 66-year-old Canadian, had been married to a Ukrainian girl, Ganna Ziuzina, 33, his thirteen years younger wife, whom he had met on the Internet and whom he had engaged with at a speedy engagement. His family in the UK had at once assumed that his death was suspicious. His family were convinced that something was going on. At first, the police in Kiev declared that the death was an accident, and the driver of the hurried car, who was later recognized as a woman named Dominika Dyka, was never taken into custody, which prompted further inquiries. They hired private detectives, who uncovered some inconsistencies in Ganna's story and questioned her past. They found Ganna's behavior after the death disturbingly detached, as if she was more interested in the financial consequences of the death of Barry than the mourning of her husband. Then they questioned the circumstances in which Barry had appeared on the carriageway in the middle of the night: he was supposedly celebrating his first wedding anniversary with Ganna at a restaurant and had left to find a taxi. Ganna turned out to have worked in the sex industry and had allegedly been involved in other suspicious circumstances. They thought that Ganna was arranging his death, perhaps for financial reasons. It was still a mystery why he was on the hard shoulder of the road, instead of waiting for a cab at the cab stand. The family of Barry fought relentlessly for an inquest in the UK, convinced that the Ukrainian investigation was inadequate and partial. The inquest, held in 2017, heard evidence from the private detectives, forensic experts, witnesses to the death of Barry and Ganna. The final verdict was that Barry Pring was murdered, the victim of a \"precise\" conspiracy. Barry had left her a significant inheritance, including a life insurance and a house in London. But Ganna maintained her innocence and has never been charged with her husband's death. The inquest could not name the guilty party, but it was clear that Ganna Ziuzina was under suspicion. The case remains unresolved, a heartbreaking testimony to the tragic death and the family's unremitting fight for justice.justice. The unanswered questions continue to fuel speculation and leave a lingering sense of unease.",
        " But for Turnbull it was not enough to be for a cause; the timing and context had to be right to achieve a successful result. He was probably recalling the disquieting experience of the Senate ballot in the year of the year seven hundred and ninety-nine, where the model for a republic was rejected as too flawed, and he was anxious to avoid a repetition of that defeat. He understood the deep divisions that a national vote might expose, and the danger that it would distract attention from more pressing national issues. The government’s task was to encourage the public’s interest, not to lead it. This is why he was relying on grass-roots and individual activists to provide the momentum for change, and he would be less a spokesman than a guide, at least in the early stages. He was taking a pragmatist’s approach, putting the priority on those issues where the prospects of success were better.",
        " “It was always there—you know,” he said, rather hesitantly. He was talking about the battle standard which had been kept in a cupboard at Penllyn Castle, near Cowbridge, ever since he was a boy. He remembered his grandfather, a great collector, having put it there years before. He was now clearing out the castle—a task long put off since the death of his father—a huge responsibility and a weight of responsibility which weighed heavily on him. The standard was found again. “We were playing hide and seek in the castle as children, and I remember the cupboard in which it was kept. I used to look at the faded banner and think nothing of it.” He unfurled it carefully, and saw a large, rectangular banner with a peculiar, stylised eagle clutching a wreath. He had seen it a thousand times before, but this time he was struck by the rich embroidery, the beautiful colours—even if faded—and the strange design. He took some photographs and sent them to a friend who worked at the National Museum of Wales. He had expected little, perhaps a courteous note pointing out the obvious and the banality of the thing. Below the eagle was a motto in elegant, anglicised script, which he did not recognise. “Arthur, you’ve no idea what you’ve got,” said his friend Eleanor in a voice vibrating with excitement. “That is... that is potentially very, very significant.” Arthur felt a shot of something. “Can you bring it in?” “Yes, of course. We need to examine it at once. What if...” He held the standard in his hands, and trembled slightly, wondering what was behind the forgotten rag, and how it had ended up in a cupboard in Penllyn Castle for so many years. The tranquil, tranquil life he had accepted suddenly seemed full of possibility. The responsibility of the estate was still there, but he could feel it was being balanced by the sense of expectation, the expectation of things to come.feeling that he was on the verge of uncovering something truly extraordinary.",
        " The consequences of this systemic gap are many. A late intervention often means more complex and expensive treatment, a longer recovery time, and a lower chance of achieving long-term well-being. Experts say that this lack of early help means that patients reach crisis point, which places a heavy burden on the emergency services and mental health care. The stigmatisation of mental illness is perpetuated: When only in crisis does someone seek help, it reinforces the negative view of mental illness as a taboo subject that is only addressed in extreme situations. There are more hospital admissions and readmissions. Patients who could have been treated in the community, with early help, are now admitted to hospital. There is more burnout among the frontline staff, who are constantly dealing with patients in crisis, leading to high stress and the potential for compassion fatigue. The devastation to families and communities is devastating: The sight of a loved one in crisis can be very upsetting; a lack of support can strain family relationships and create a cycle of hopelessness. There is a lack of productivity in the workforce, as people with untreated mental health issues are unable to work and contribute to the economy. * The training and education of primary care physicians: Making it possible for the physicians to recognise mental health problems in the early stages and to give the appropriate treatment. * Public information and anti-stigma campaigns: Helping people to seek help early by talking openly about mental health issues and promoting help-seeking behaviour. * Increasing the availability and accessibility of mental health care in the community: Helping people to get closer to care and receive it in the home environment can be the best way to prevent serious mental illnesses from developing. * Improved integration of mental and physical health care: Recognising the relationship between mental and physical health, and enabling better and more effective treatment. * Increasing the amount of support in schools: Identifying and supporting children and adolescents can have a lasting effect. * The correct priority of early help and prevention.create a system that supports mental well-being and prevents individuals from reaching crisis.",
        " The sharp-eyed dog-walker, who was accustomed to finding only bottles and fishing nets, caught the odd regularity of the wood and the angles cut into its surface. He tentatively touched it with his stick, and the sound rang out in the damp atmosphere. The grey, barnacle-encrusted timber, which had at first been mistaken for a piece of driftwood, had persistently resisted the constant push and pull of the tides. There had been careful investigations, hampered by the ebb and flow of the tides, which twice a day plunged the object back into the water. The dog-walker informed the municipal authorities, who in turn alerted the archaeologists. Carbon dating had revealed the age of the weir: medieval, perhaps earlier. The well-shaped timbers, precisely cut and shaped, indicated a deep knowledge of the tides and the behavior of fish. This well, remarkably preserved in the anaerobic embrace of the mud, testified to a time long past. It was a survival of a past in which survival depended on ingenuity and a deep knowledge of the natural world, when people lived by the sea, nourished by its fruits. The news of the discovery went round the scientific community. The main question remained: who had built it, and what stories did its ancient grain contain? The weir at Southampton Water promised to unveil secrets, to reveal a past history in its full complexity, to paint a more complex and colorful picture of the local area, timber by carefully removed timber.",
        " Meanwhile the RAC were pointing out that while crude oil prices had been steadily rising, the pound's decline made importing oil more expensive, which meant that, even if the price in dollars remained stable, the importers of British oil paid more in pounds to buy it.... This double whammy, as the RAC called it, was putting extra pressure on British drivers at the pump. They called on the government to keep a close eye on the situation and consider taking measures to help motorists if the trend continued. And they urged the retailers to be fair and not to raise their prices needlessly, because it was in the interests of fairness to the consumer, particularly at a time when many households were worried about their finances.",

The name was changed after careful consideration and after consultation with students, parents, staff and the local community. The school claimed that it would continue to maintain its commitment to a safe and supportive environment for students, without being overshadowed by the negative connotations of its old name.",
        " This was a stockbroker from London, Nicholas Winton, who at the age of 29 interrupted his trip to Switzerland in favor of a trip to Prague, where he was greatly moved by the situation of the Jews who were fleeing from Nazi persecution. During the first nine months of 1938, he organized the transport of Jewish children from occupied Czechoslovakia to Great Britain. On his own and with the help of his small staff, he was able to overcome many bureaucratic obstacles and transport the children to Great Britain. He set up an office in a hotel and started to register children whose parents wanted to get them away. For more than forty years, he did not speak of his work and only told it in 1988, when his wife, Grete, found in the attic of their house a scrapbook in which were written lists of the children he had saved, letters from their parents and letters from the families where they had been taken in. He was able to make eight such transports, with a total of 669 children, before the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, when the borders were closed. The discovery of the book aroused public interest and the British Schindler became known in Great Britain. After the discovery, the BBC made a film called That's Life!, where Winton met the grown-up children he had saved and who had become famous. He was humble about his work and only said that he did what he thought was right. In 2003, Queen Elizabeth II decorated him with the Order of Freedom and he was awarded many other awards for his extraordinary courage and humanity. At the age of 106, he died on June 19, 2015.",
        " fanners, who had dared to believe after the first flurry of goals, were now shuffled out, muttering complaints and casting sceptical glances at the board. The air of the grounds was thick with the smell of the season’s leaves, the weight of expectation and the agonizingly crushing effect of another thwarted attempt at winning. There was a dark sense of dismay and disbelief in the air at Pittodrie. A depressing pattern was emerging, and this second-half stutter seemed to be a symptom of the true, deeper malaise that had become the team’s curse when it played at home. Amid the emptying stands, Stephen Glass paced the touchline, his face creased with concern. In the dressing-room there was wild jubilation, and the unexpected hero, Taylor, was hugged by his team-mates, whose late equalizer was a victory for their tenacity and determination. The disgruntled murmurs were becoming louder, and Glass sensed that the board was losing patience. A point, unexpectedly gained, was like a victory. It was the kind of result that could fire up a team, a moment to build on. The manager was beaming as he praised their character and fighting spirit. Then, in his dressing-room, he wondered what it was that was so wrong —was it a lack of confidence, a lack of skill or something else altogether? And back in the city, questions persisted. Why did such a talented team, with so much promise, continually fail to deliver at home? The long, cold winter that lay ahead promised to be a testing time for the Dons and their beleaguered manager. There were no easy answers, but they needed to be found before the season, and perhaps Glass’s position, were lost forever.",

He glanced at his partners, who were seasoned veterans. With only four holes to go, every shot counted. Aphibarnrat studied the wind, and finally decided on a 7-iron. The fifteenth hole, a long par-3, was a difficult shot with water on the left and a bunker on the right. His rivals were all at a loss, and feared he might lose the game. His rivals all missed the shot, and his own shot fell short, but his partners could not. Aphibarnrat smoothly took a swipe, and the ball soared up to land on the green about 20 feet from the hole.

        " The script is titled Echoes of Yesterday. Roth’s handling of his characters and his quietly powerful narrative are masterly. The play’s setting is the epoch, the period, the event, the historical scene of which the reader will know already from the beginning. The dialogues are convincing, ringing with character, and Roth’s detailed research into the historical setting is not displayed in exposition. The opening scene, a seemingly ordinary conversation between [character A] and [character B] in the [location] of the [event or location], immediately brings out the theme of [the two or three main themes, e.g. loss, resilience, seeking meaning]. The principal conflict arises when [the principal conflict briefly explained]. The author is a master at revealing the great truths in small, intimate details, a technique that won him acclaim in Forrest Gump. He leaves the reader to work out the larger context for himself, concentrating on the personal journey of the individual characters. The reviews by the studios are unanimously favourable, and all praise Roth’s ability to create flawed characters who are at the same time extremely human. The resulting chain of events brings to the fore both the character of the individual and the significance of the historical context, and Roth expertly links the two threads in his own inimitable way, producing a powerful and deeply moving narrative. The expectations for Echoes of Yesterday are high; it will be a major contender for the Academy Awards. “It is not just another historical drama,” one studio head says, “it is a play about humanity, and Eric Roth has told it with extraordinary sensitivity and grace.”",

The narrow country roads are already heavily used by agricultural traffic.... Residents are worried about the impact on local wildlife, about air and noise pollution, and about the changes to the landscape. **Property Values:*** The negative impact of oil and gas extraction has led to fears that property values will fall. ***... Island Gas has submitted a number of applications to the Nottinghamshire County Council for various aspects of the test drilling, including the drilling rig, access to the site and waste management. ***... Increased traffic from heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) related to the drilling operation could cause major disruptions and damage to the local roads and the local economy. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *** * * *** *** *** *** *** *** ** * *** Public Consultations:*** The planning applications have been the subject of consultation, with a large number of local residents, local councils and other organisations objecting. * *** Island Gas:*** The company seeking planning permission for the test drilling. **** Local residents:*** Those who live in Misson and the surrounding area and who are directly affected by the proposals. **** Legal challenges:*** If the planning applications are approved, the possibility of legal challenges to overturn the decision is possible. **** The County Council:*** The body charged with making the decision to grant planning permission. **** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *** The planning authority responsible for making decisions on the applications. * **Environmental Groups:** Organizations concerned about the potential environmental impacts of oil and gas extraction. * **Local Councils:** Parish councils and district councils that represent the interests of local communities. * **The UK Government:** Responsible for setting national energy policy and regulations. **The future of the Springs Road test drilling project depends on the outcome of the planning application process and any subsequent legal challenges.

        " It was a triumph of nostalgia for some and a frantic blunder by others, and one week after another the rising hope of another audience was dashed on the rock of lack of talent and apparent lack of faith. In April, when he was appointed until the end of the season, the old English captain failed to gain a single point. The players, who had once been considered a strong team, were confused and disconcerted. He had tried everything: the almighty yell, the firm handshake, the ritual chant and the bizarre dance. At the final whistle, boos rang out from the crowd not only at the players but at the man who had promised so much and given so little. The final match, a resounding defeat at the hands of the principal rival, was the last blow. They were a pale shadow of the former brilliant team. The dream of a fairy tale ending had turned into a nightmare. He stood at the side of the field with a look of dejection, and on his face was a record of the misfortunes of the season. The end of the game was played, the defeat was complete and the future uncertain. What would become of the club? The future of the team was at stake. What could they do to secure their future?",
        " A chemist with his eyes closed, a pipette full of a bright green liquid and a tiny test tube, with a caption saying, \"Accurate Pipetting. Now with 100% fewer spills!\" Another showed an overworked research assistant, frantically wiping the screen of his glasses, holding a pipette containing a bright green liquid over a test tube, as if he were using the force to keep the liquid from escaping. In the end, it went up on April 1 and was accompanied by the hashtags # May the science be with you and # ForceForGood. Although most people figured out that it was an obvious prank, many were attracted by the science of magic. Besides, there was something more unexpected: the prank had a real effect. \"We wanted to take the seriousness of science out of the heads of science and show people that even a complex science can be funny,\" one of the authors explained in a press conference after the April Fools' joke. \" But then the prank became too real. \" Although the devil's doctor was amused at first, he quickly realized that it was a danger that could have been taken too seriously. The request for the bioenergetics of life forces, the analysis of middle and lower magic and the development of the light saber with a high precision surgical instrument flooded the mailbox of the center. \"We had to issue a clarification,\" the doctor sighed, \"that, to the best of our knowledge, the force does not exist in a scientifically recognized form.\" However, she added with a wink, \"we are always open to new research, as long as it is not dark science. \" Besides, the incident had a positive side. The general interest in the research of the center increased significantly, so that the Internet audience grew significantly and the center received many more newcomers.in applications for their summer internship program. It proved that even a well-executed April Fool's joke could be a force for good, reminding the world that science, like the Force, is a powerful tool that can inspire, educate, and even, on occasion, make us laugh.",

        " The basic difficulty is that the complaints, refined over decades of experience, have often been lost in the din of political battles and administrative inertia. Their voice, which has been polished for forty years, in a long tradition of scrutiny of health care policy and practice, has often been lost in the din of political maneuvering and bureaucratic inertia. These watchdogs, which have been in action for forty years, would like to have a greater profile as a body that voices the problems of the National Health Service. They have seen the cracks, they hear the complaints of patients and employees, and they meticulously document them, but they are often met with politeness and not much else. \"We are not looking for power for the sake of power,\" says Eleanor Vance, chairman of the oldest of the monitors, \"but to be able to truly influence the change. \" And they advocate: * - Greater media involvement: actively seeking opportunities to comment on current issues and giving, based on the research, their informed point of view; * - Direct contact with ministers and officials: establishing direct contact with the powerful; * * * Direct access to politicians and officials: establishing direct and regular communication with them; * * * Influence through the voice of women: in addition to the women, the voices of minorities, the marginalized and the under-represented: to help identify solutions to problems. * * * Increased public awareness: launching public information campaigns on the role and role of the organization, on how to contact them. * - Increased research powers: demanding that the Health Service and other parties give them information and fully cooperate with them. However, their ambitions face great obstacles. In addition, obtaining more money and resources, in the current difficult economic climate, is a big challenge. In addition, concerns have been expressed that the work of the watchdogs might be duplicated in view of the activities of the regulatory body, the Care Quality Commission. And some employees of the Health Service have a negative view of these watchdogs as being too critical and damaging. As one of the members says, we've been watching for forty years, and now it's time to be heard. The watchdogs recognize the obstacles but are determined to fight for a more transparent and accountable health service.",
        " In the room where Eleanor Vance breathed her last, a light breeze blew, rustling the sheer curtains in the sea-side house, which was already drifting on the waves, the scent of the frangipanes and the salt-smell. The scented air was pierced by the leaves of a palm tree and the sunlight passed through the trellis. The old lady's daughter, Sarah, held her mother's hand, hers smoothed by a life of making pottery; and her son Thomas, a photographer of note, had captured one last, fleeting portrait of the face of his mother, engraved with the depths of wisdom and serenity. And all around the old woman sat her children, her grandchildren and a great-grandchild, in a mute, loving vigil. Eleanor's breath grew shallow, every breath an intimate farewell. Her eyes, still keen and intelligent, were skimming the faces she loved. And the grandchildren, some tearful, some holding each other's hands, remembered the fairy tales she had told them, tales of bush adventures and creatures, breathing with the spirit of the bush. She sighed gently and was gone. A single tear rolled from the corner of her eye, down the crevice of her cheek. She pressed her daughter's hand gently and, in that weak pressure, made a silent gesture of the relationship that bound them both. The sea-breeze seemed to carry her spirit out to sea, to the land of which she had written so beautifully. The room was still and silent; the waves were breaking on the beach, softly but incessantly. The Australian literature had lost one of its giants, but the words, which she had written, would go on telling stories for the generations to come, of the enduring power of storytelling and the enduring love of a family.",
        " The United States is firmly, but in an unofficial way, bound to the mainland government of China, and yet it has an important but unofficial relationship with the island of Formosa, and even helps Taiwan to acquire military power. It is this policy of \"One China\" that has been a basic pillar of US-China relations for a long time. The policy is a delicate and complex policy, and it is constantly being revised and discussed by the government and foreign affairs experts in the United States. Specifically, the United States does not declare that it will intervene in a military conflict between China and Taiwan, but it seems to have the intention of deterring China from launching a war and for Taiwan to declare independence and thus avoiding the threat of a Chinese invasion. The situation in the world is changing, China's military power is becoming more and more powerful, and Taiwan's democratic progress has a great influence on this long-standing policy. This policy has the merit of preserving the security of the region, promoting US interests in Asia, and handling the relations with a rising world power. But it also has inherent risks, such as the misunderstanding of crisis and escalation.",

Chapman was remanded in custody due to the seriousness of the charges and the risk of witness intimidation.’ Scenario 2: The charges are drug-related —‘ ‘Jamie Chapman, aged 28, of Tamar Drive, Smith’s Wood, Solihull, has been charged with fifteen offences, believed to be assault and related offences, and was remanded in custody by the magistrates in Birmingham. It is believed that these charges relate to a number of incidents which occurred in the Smith’s Wood area over the last few weeks. The defendant will appear at Birmingham Crown Court on [DATE]’ Scenario 3: The charges are aggravated assault —‘ ‘Jamie Chapman, aged 28, of Tamar Drive, Smith’s Wood, Solihull, was charged with fifteen counts, believed to be assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was remanded in custody after a hearing at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court on the 12th of April. Chapman applied for bail but it was refused.

The discovery of her body, on 10 April, was a catastrophe for the community of Hebden Bridge, and transformed the disappearance inquiry into a murder inquiry. Her body was found strangled. The case was frequently reviewed and re-examined in the years that followed, with the progress of forensic science and the introduction of new lines of enquiry. Appeals were made to the public, with re-enactments of the events, on television, and renewed calls for information from anyone who might have withheld it. A great many leads were pursued, thousands of witnesses were questioned, a huge area of the countryside was searched, but the murderer remained elusive. The case remains open, a constant reminder of the tragedy, and a lingering hope that one day, the killer will be caught.

        " Before the arrival of President Obama, the bar graph had dropped into a abyss of dark red, showing the catastrophic unemployment of the Great Recession. This modest graph, which indicated the monthly change in the number of American workers outside the agricultural sector, silently testified to the troubled state of the economy which President Obama had inherited and to the slow, heavy, grinding, protracted process of recovery he was directing. It represented hope and despair, success and setback, always as a reminder of the magnitude of the task. Slowly, painfully slowly, the red was pushed back, and a green bar appeared. Each red bar represented hundreds of thousands of lost incomes, countless struggling families, a nation on the brink. It was a gruesome picture of the state of economic devastation. Each green bar represented new jobs, new opportunities, a glimmer of light in the darkness. The bars, at first small and uncertain, grew higher, frequent and certain. It was not a perfect narrative, to be sure. It reflected the discussions of the stimulus packages, the debates about government intervention, the painful choices in the face of unprecedented problems. It showed the slow, arduous climb out of the abyss, the rebuilding of the American economy. This humble bar graph, far from soaring speeches and monumental laws, told the story of the Obama presidency with a more intimate, more harrowing, and ultimately more telling word — a word about jobs, about living standards, about the grueling climb back to prosperity. The recovery was not even, the green bars were not equally distributed, and the graph never reached the heights of pre-recession prosperity. But it was a testimony to the resilience of the American spirit and the power of recovery, even when the odds were steep.",
        " Some suspected the unseasonable cold, and the gusty wind that swept through the King Power stadium. However, the goal of the game was not yet reached, and the room was shown as empty. In the meantime, the whole of the audience, which had gathered to watch the match against Tottenham, saw a great many empty seats. And yet the most common and incontrovertible theory was about the ticketing system, the club's systems, long queues at the ticket office and some confusion over seat allocation. Others blamed the Wednesday game, arguing that 8 o'clock was too late for working families to arrive. The atmosphere inside the stadium was strangely quiet, despite the high stakes of an FA Cup match with a rival of the Premier League. The usual roar, which greeted the Leicester team when they came out, was noticeably reduced. The most vociferous group of fans claimed that, despite having valid tickets, they were not allowed to enter, and that the stewards were too few to deal with the situation. It was already clear that, whether it was the weather, the time or the ticketing, the club needed to make quick decisions to avoid the disenchantment of its supporters. And when the whistle blew, the empty stands pointed out the rift between the club and some of its most loyal supporters. The players themselves seemed to notice the low attendance as they warmed up, and exchanged worried looks. Nevertheless, the game began, and the foxes were expected to produce a performance worthy of the support they should have had.",

        " One of the huge wind-turbine parts on the road, a low-loader bearing a heavy blade, had become entangled in a corner near the village of Corsock. This accident, which delayed traffic for a long time, was in fact the result of the low-loader carrying a blade having come off its loading cradle on a very tight bend. Local people reported hearing a great squeaking as the vehicle rounded the corner, before becoming stuck in the narrow verge. “It was a real nuisance,” said one of the locals, Mrs Agnes MacTavish. The low-loader was part of a convoy of several blades, the size of which stretched to well over fifty metres. The driver was understandably in a state of disarray. “The road was completely blocked, and the queue of traffic was miles long. You could see he was beside himself.” The road was eventually opened again on the following morning, but not before much inconvenience and delays for travellers. The police had been called, and had been working all night to assist the recovery effort, using heavy-duty cranes. “The need for renewable energy is well-known,” said Councillor John Murray. But in order to ensure the windfarms are sustainable in the fullest sense of the word, it is necessary to consider the disruption of transporting these huge parts, and the possibility of damage to roads and bridges. “This has been a serious blow to our rural communities,” he continued. The company responsible for the transport of these parts has launched an investigation, apologised for the inconvenience caused, and undertaken to review their transport routes in order to avoid such accidents in the future. “Sustainable development means that we have to ensure our transport systems are able to cope with the demands being made of them, and that the impact on our residents is kept to a minimum.” The company’s transport operations have come up against a major snag. And as this accident has shown, there is a cost to be paid.of the damage to the roadside and the recovery operation is expected to be substantial, adding to the already significant expense of the project.",
        " But the game was not intended for students, nor for the new gaming club, but for a very specific and strange agricultural research: to study the effect of driving a simulated plow on the stress level of farm animals. The money will be used for the purchase of a PS3 at the Maurward College near Dorchester. The virtual reality devices are expensive and are not always practicable in the field. Dr. Emily Carter, the head of the project, explained: We have equipped the console with a game that simulates driving a plow, he continued, holding up a worn controller. We needed a more portable and affordable alternative to mimic the real experience. And so we use a PS3. We play it loudly close to different groups of animals, cows, sheep and alpacas, while we measure their heartbeats and stress hormones, and then, if it has long been exposed to the simulated rhythm and sound of plowing, we can see if the animals are less anxious when plowing actually begins. It's very real. But there was no lack of skeptics who claimed that it was a waste of taxpayers' money, while others were interested and saw that a calmer, less excited livestock population would have some advantages. It was even offered a copy of the game Farming Simulator to support the project. An old farmer named Old Hemmings, a veteran of the old school, even offered his copy. He had had the game for a few years, and he knew it was not used in this way. It was a low-cost, forward-looking approach, insisted Dr. Carter. And who knows, perhaps it could help us to achieve something new. Perhaps a new generation of digitally trained farmers will arise as a result. Every farmer must begin somewhere, and some may well begin with a PS3 controller.",
        " He leaned back in his old, shabby chair, the flag that was spread behind him cast a faint and spectral light on his face. “You know, most people think it’s all about glory, all about remembering the Alamo! But when I was about sixty-four, I had a thing or two to do with the Alamo. And it was all right. And sure, it was all right, but for me...” He fell silent, broken only by the tick-tick of an old clock in the corner. “It’s not so much about glory as about the choices they made, and the odds they faced, and the sheer obstinacy of not giving up.” He shook his hand at his thinning grey hair. “When you get my age, you start thinking about the choices you’ve made, the battles you’ve fought and the ones you’ve run from.” He picked up a small, smooth stone from the table beside him and turned it in his fingers. “You look at these men—they were boys, really—and you ask yourself if you’d have had that courage, that commitment, that stubbornness.” He lowered the stone and looked out the window. “My grandfather used to tell me about his grandfather, who fought at San Jacinto. He said it was the memory of the Alamo that gave them their courage, that made them fight like lions.” He sighed. “Maybe that’s it, maybe I’m just trying to understand where I came from.” “Or at least I’m trying to find the lion in me before it’s too late.”",

        " Very importantly, it will enable balloons to maintain their altitude and provide more reliable and stable network coverage. Until now, the balloons had to be controlled by humans relying on very complex models. This would make it more difficult to maintain the stability of the network. In addition, the weather prediction system can automatically predict the weather, and automatically adjust the altitude and position of the balloon, so as to maintain the balloon at the same position, which is longer and more stable. The weather prediction system used a large number of historical and real-time data, including wind speed and direction, pressure and humidity, and analyzed them in a logical manner, so that the balloon could automatically control the altitude and speed, and stay in the same place, and the life of the balloon could be extended.. And there is a point to say: this breakthrough is a step forward in making the Internet a more common phenomenon for remote areas in the future.",
        " Still, although he didn’t score often, his late runs into the penalty area and the spaces he found in them meant that the goalkeepers were always wary of him. The Livi had succeeded thanks to a solid defence and the crucial goals of Martin, the midfielder who despite not being a prolific goalscorer, scored enough to keep the defence on edge.... As a consequence, while the Riders were spoiled by the goals of the otherwise disappointing striker, The Rock, Livi’s great success was due to the safety of its defense and the crucial goals of Martin, who played from midfield. The local press highlighted the disparity between the two teams: the Livingston Ledger had a banner headline saying, “Livi on top, the Riders trailing behind,” accompanied by a picture of Martin celebrating his goal. The Gazette of the Riders, however, wrote about the poor performances of the team, its tactics and the morale of the players. Did he want to stay at Livi and help the team to succeed, or would he be tempted by the prestige and higher salary of a big team? Now, with the transfer window opening, the question of his future was hotly debated. Many clubs, impressed by his performances, were interested in buying him. It would be interesting to see what happened....",
        " There was a great commotion. The rivals argued, shouted and fought. It was not a matter of mere words or of a difference in procedure, as one might expect, but of outright fights,” he said with a sigh. He shook his head. The memory was clearly disagreeable to him. Things got out of hand; the commissioners hit each other and wrestled on the floor... It was a disgrace and, let’s face it, a threat to the entire election process. Mediation, religious leaders, even leadership were tried, nothing seemed to work. The tension was immense, the result of political affiliation, suspicions of bias, and a complete lack of trust. He looked up and asked to be understood. “It was a clash of interests of the highest order, the opposition was too ingrained and the differences were too deep. In the end, it undermined the election and I will bear this as a burden for the rest of my life.” “But it was a matter of great concern for us. The whole country was looking to us to present a fair and orderly election, but we could not manage even to remain in order ourselves.”",

        " “The case was found in the glove compartment of a silver Corsa which was parked outside the door of a well-known drug den on Elm Street. The driver, Mark J., a single-man operator, aged twenty-seven, was arrested for possessing a controlled substance.... “Although the quantity of cocaine is very small, the offense is still serious,” Sergeant Davies, the investigating officer, told us. “Such a small quantity may indicate a greater involvement with this drug. Mark J. was taken to the local police station for further interrogation.” The Vauxhall Corsa was impounded and is undergoing a forensic examination. The authorities hope to find evidence such as fingerprints and traces of other substances that might shed some light on the origin and use of the cocaine. We are now investigating Mr. J.’s possible connections with other people and groups in the region who are involved in the distribution and sale of narcotics.” The small amount of cocaine, which is of negligible value, is another clue in the saga of drug-related crimes on Elm Street. Mr. J., who was known to the police for previous traffic offenses, refused to answer any questions during the first interrogation. “An adamant refusal may be a sign of fear of being caught,” one police source said. “The authorities are determined to break the chain of distribution and bring the perpetrators to justice.”",

Under the spotlight, Hughie Maughan's Teak complexion made people clap their hands at the keyboard with a mixture of amusement, envy, and the eternal question: \"Fake tan or sunbed commitment?\" Another man posted a picture of Hughie next to a leather chesterfield, the resemblance being uncanny. “Is Hughie sponsored by Ronseal?” one wit asked, referring to a brand of wood varnish. Despite the humour, the discussion became more serious. People praised Hughie for his unwavering commitment to his aesthetic and admired his confidence. The hash tag #HughieHue became a repository of the most outrageous and hilarious comparisons. Meanwhile, blissfully unaware of the buzz, Hughie continued to glisten under the studio lights, a halo of colour attributable either to a very good spray tanner or to a long-term relationship with his local tanning salon. Either way, he had succeeded in being the most talked-about colour on TV. Others questioned the health implications of such a dark tan, which led to further discussions about body image and responsible tanning practices.

        " According to the Times, a process of pronuclear transfer was used in Kiev, in what was probably a world first. In the report, the Times says: “Using the pronuclear transfer method, a Russian research team has reportedly given birth to a child whose parents each contribute a third of the paternal DNA in an attempt to overcome the infertility caused by the mother’s Mitochondria.” In this case, it is believed that the mother had a defective Mitochondria, which could have caused the child a serious illness, or even death. This embryo contains the nuclei of both parents, and a small amount of healthy Mitochondria from the donor. “The legal status of pronuclear transfer is unclear in many countries. “Ethical considerations about the process raise questions about human reproduction, the rights of the child, and the potential for unintended consequences. The scientific basis for the new procedure is still unknown.” You should be aware that although the Times described this as a world first, there have been similar attempts, including in the UK, though perhaps not in such a specific context. The article will also include comments from experts in the field of human reproduction and bioethics, explaining their views on the process and its implications. *",

Former Carrick boss, Haveron, was appointed manager of the Glens only a week ago, and his first match in charge was a huge one, Linfield, the champions, in front of a full Oval. It was not just a game, it was a statement, the opportunity to prove to the supporters that he was the man to lead the club back to glory. Haveron, known for his calm demeanour, felt a rush of energy he had not felt since his playing days. He adjusted his tie, took a deep breath and was ready to face the challenge.

The crowd was buzzing with whispers: “What happened?... An accident?... So close to school... ” In the area cordoned off, detectives with intense and serious faces were walking about, photographing the scene, recording every detail, and reporting by radio to the police station. The policeman politely but firmly pushed away anyone who approached the tape. The air was thick with unspoken questions. Was it a hit-and-run? A random act of violence? A murder?

After years of decline, the number of council houses sold in the year to March has risen from 1,209 to 1,526, a significant rise but one which still remains far below the highs of the past. The long-term impact of this shift in policy remains to be seen. Ongoing debates focus on the balance between the aspirations of individuals for home ownership and the need to ensure that all have access to secure and affordable accommodation. Critics, however, argue that the selling off of council houses will lead to a reduction in the already limited supply of affordable accommodation, thereby exacerbating the problem of homelessness and widening the gap between rich and poor.",

        " A wave of anger passed over the staff-room, normally filled with gentle chatter and the clatter of tea-cups. Now the room resounded with furious talk, mute and measured, but furious nevertheless. The girls who worked at Kinsley High School were claiming that their wages had been reduced, since the contract had been awarded from Wakefield Council to CD-Cleaning. The girls were justifiably indignant. Maria, a housemaid who had been with the school for twenty years, was slamming her mug on the table: “Twenty years! And this is what they give me as a reward!” Beside her, Sarah, a younger member of the staff, a single mother, was close to tears. “A reduction in wages! It’s a disgrace!” She writhed, her hands clasped round a tattered pay-slip. “I don’t know how I’m going to manage now, as it is. I’m already having trouble with the rent, and now it’s going to be beyond my means.” The girls were astonished, for they believed that the Council had a duty to protect them during the hand-over period, as the “Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)” regulations, the TUPE, had assured them that their pay would be unchanged. Now they felt themselves to have been betrayed. They had to organize. Were they, after all, ignorant of their status? Or, worse, did they want to ignore the regulations? But Maria would not be dissuaded. When the suggestion of a trade-union was made, several hesitated, afraid of the consequences. But there was a feeling of determination, and even of fear: “They can’t just treat us like this. We have to look into this and see what our options are.” The battle for fair wages at Kinsley High School had begun. They knew that to take on a company like CD-Cleaning would be no easy task, but they were resolved to fight for what they believed to be their right.

Even the BBC correspondent, who had witnessed so many wars, was deeply moved by the serenity of the child. “I would wring it out after the rain and after the dew,” Omar explained, staring at the ground. “I didn’t waste a drop.” “My mother used to make delicious ghee,” he said, and a faint smile flickered on his lips, then disappeared again. She taught me how to store it. The ghee had been scavenged from the ruins of his family home. The BBC was able to confirm part of Omar’s story from local aid workers, who had met him on his wanderings. Omar’s was one thread of the unimaginable suffering of the people in this war-torn region. They could confirm his age and the place he described. But the correspondent, still trying to understand what had happened to his family, gently pushed him to talk about what had happened to his family. Omar was hesitant, his eyes now beginning to dance with fright. “They were taken during the attack. I don’t know... I don’t know anything.” The correspondent, feeling his distress, changed the subject. “I’m sorry, I don’t know anything.” Omar, his eyes clear and bright, despite all his suffering, looked at the horizon and said, “Peace, please.” “Yes, that’s it. Peace.” “I want to go back to school. I want to make ghee like my mother.” The BBC promised to get him help and to help him find a place to stay. As they parted, the correspondent’s heart was heavy with the pain of the child, whose story could only remind the world of the cost of war., a survivor against all odds, his resilience a beacon of hope amidst the desolation.

Further Arrests and Indictments: Following the first indictments in May, the scandal that enveloped FIFA grew considerably, and the charges included massive corruption over many years, bribery, kickbacks and fraud relating to the awarding of media and marketing rights to major tournaments, including the World Cup. The pressure on Sepp Blatter, the long-serving president of FIFA, who had just been re-elected to a fifth term, grew ever greater, and he announced his resignation just days after being re-elected. This was a key moment in the crisis. 2. Asset Freezes and Seizures: The authorities in many countries froze assets and seized assets and funds belonging to the individuals and entities involved in the corruption scandal. 3. An internal investigation by FIFA: Within FIFA itself, an investigation was launched into the extent of the corruption, and who was involved, which took place alongside the external investigations being carried out by the police and judicial authorities. 4. Concerns about the sponsorship: Major sponsors of FIFA, such as Coca-Cola, VISA and McDonald’s, showed deep concern about the corruption allegations and called for major reforms in the organization, and some even threatened to stop their sponsorship if major reforms were not undertaken. The aim was to recover ill-gotten gains and prevent further corruption. 5. Swiss Investigation: In addition to the American investigation, Switzerland also began a separate investigation into the award of the World Cup to Russia in 2018 and to Qatar in 2022. 6. Calls for Reform: In the wake of the scandal, there were calls for major reforms of FIFA, in terms of transparency, accountability and oversight. There was a strong push for a radical overhaul of the governance of the organization and the creation of a new, anti-corruption body to take over. This called for another major change. 7. Resignations: The resignations, the arrests and the investigations led to a period of great uncertainty for the organization and its future, with the goal of restoring its reputation and its legitimacy.

        " And the first is Quantum Computing. The silicon 28 is essential to the construction of a quantum computer, which will be more stable and less subject to accidents than those of the present time. The ordinary silicon contains different isotopes, such as silicon 29, which have different spins and may affect the delicate states of the qubits. Such a state of the qubits is like a sensitive instrument, which requires a flat and noiseless platform; every vibration or noise (other isotopes) disturbs the measurements. The use of silicon 28 greatly reduces this interference, allowing longer coherence times and thus more complex quantum calculations. Secondly, the semiconductor industry. Although silicon 28 does not directly serve for the production of silicon transistors, it is the basis for research on advanced semiconductor materials. Likewise, the silicon 28 is able to define a new standard for measurement, such as the kilogram, which is based on a physical artifact (the kilogram prototype). The fortyfold increase in the quality of the American physicists' silicon 28 is an important step, which means that the required quality for the exploitation of the silicon 28 for the exploitation of quantum computers is within reach. Apart from the exploitation of quantum computing and metrology, silicon 28 with very high purity can also be used in other fields where the isotope's quality is of critical importance, such as in physics, such as in the development of new materials. The race to build a working quantum computer is still open, and the United States is now significantly accelerated by the ability to produce silicon 28. The next steps will probably be to scale up the production, reduce costs and integrate the silicon 28 into real quantum computing devices, which will require significant investments and cooperation between scientists, engineers and industry partners.",

The rescue team, said a spokesman, was stretched to the limit by this surge of call-outs to the top of Wales and England. In August alone, it said, it was called out a record 43 times, and it was concerned about the long-term viability of the service. The team noted several common problems that had led to call-outs, including slips, falls, navigational problems, medical emergencies and people becoming lost due to darkness or tiredness. ‘First, the good weather has drawn more people to the mountains. Secondly, the number of inexperienced walkers and climbers, who are climbing on paths beyond their capability, are also increasing, often with inadequate equipment and unprepared for the rapidly changing mountain conditions.’ ‘While we are always ready to help, we are also asking people to take more responsibility for their own safety,’ said the spokesman. ‘A little preparation can make the difference between an enjoyable day out and a life-threatening situation.’ The team is working with local authorities, including the Snowdonia National Park Authority, to come up with ways of managing the increase in demand, such as greater educational campaigns, improved signposting on popular routes and, possibly, a stricter enforcement of regulations on appropriate equipment and experience. The emphasis needs to change from rescue to prevention.’ ‘The long-term aim is to protect the safety of mountain visitors, while also safeguarding the vital work of the dedicated volunteers who tirelessly give their time to serve the mountain community.’",

        " - It's not a baby, it's a test baby, made to withstand the whirlwind of the wash. The baby spins at 1,400 rpm... that's what the technician told us. The team gathered around the reinforced washing machine, where a complex system of sensors and cameras aimed at the porthole. Doctor Anya, the head of the engineers, adjusted his glasses and nodded. “He is Washie, the key to making safer and stronger washing machines,” said Dr. Yen-yu. A technician pressed the start button. “All right, we'll start the simulation. The maximum load, with maximum spin, at 1,400 rpm.” Anya waited, holding his breath, until the water started to fill and fill the washing machine. Washie was gently moving in the whirlpool, looking too much like a real child. The sensors screamed data: G-force, stress, collision points. The machine slowly began to spin, then accelerated with a terrifying whine. Washie was already a blur, spinning along the wall of the drum. - The G-force reaches 250. No structural damage, the technician said, staring at the monitor. - It holds. The end of months of development. Anya slowly exhaled. The noise in the laboratory grew louder and louder, then gradually fell. The vibrations of Washie's body simulated the resilience of a real child, while he withstood extreme forces. Washie was made of special materials and a special form of shock absorption, and thus he could withstand great stresses. Anya, her heart pounding, rushed to the washing machine, carefully opened the porthole and took Washie out of the washing machine. The water drained, and the machine stopped. - Success! she exclaimed, grinning. Washie was soaked, slightly damaged, but intact. - It worked! A step towards a stronger and safer washing machine! -.\" Of course, they never actually put a real baby in the washing machine.

        " The problem, as the Belfast Telegraph reports, is the mismatch between the amount of the compensation fund and the number of tenants affected by the under-occupancy charge, commonly known as the “bedroom tax”. While the 91 million pounds was intended to cover the cost of a full offset for eligible tenants, the memo suggests the demand is significantly greater than the available resources. Givan’s stark analysis of the situation has caused a political row and raised serious questions about the effectiveness of mitigation measures in the province. The paper quotes sources close to the minister expressing his frustration at the current position and calling for a comprehensive review of mitigation strategies, including the possible reallocation of resources, in order to protect vulnerable tenants. The paper goes on to report that the issue is set to dominate Stormont in the coming days and that the issue has already been identified as a “time-bomb” that could explode into a major riot if urgent action is not taken to address the shortfall. The Belfast Telegraph claims that thousands of families could face financial hardship and possibly even be evicted from their homes. The paper also reports reactions from housing rights groups who describe the shortfall as a “catastrophic failure” that will disproportionately affect low-income households and further increase inequalities. The paper says the SDLP and Sinn Fein will press the communities minister, Gordon Lyons, for answers on how the government will respond and how it will prevent widespread hardship.",

        " So arose a glorious day when, by the wish of a friend, he had a blacksmith’s daughter who had been brought up for the use of a wig-maker and had to dress herself, and in the centre of the window, looking through at a work of art of his wife, saw the waif of his young daughter.

        " And here she stopped and gave a little smile. “Joining... the monastery. I have been asked several times in my youth to think of joining, and I have never been able to make up my mind to it,” said Fraulein Seifert, who began her modeling career at the age of fourteen and later worked as a radio presenter. “It always seems to amaze people, that I should be asked to think of it. I strutted about in expensive outfits and interviewed celebrities, and it should have seemed that I was called to become a nun.” She chuckled softly and shook her head. “I had still to find out who I was at the age of fourteen, and so it would have seemed impossible to me to dedicate my life to prayer and service. Not that I had no respect for the institution or the women who had dedicated themselves to it, but the way of life was too foreign to everything I knew.” She bent forward with an air of seriousness. “And to tell the truth, I was very interested in the superficial things of life at that time, and it would have seemed to me like exchanging a Technicolor dream for a black-and-white photograph.” “I was young and naive and I longed for external confirmation of my existence. The monastery offered the opposite: it offered a life withdrawn from the world, a life of peace and piety. The makeup, the outfits, the attention—all this was enticing.” But she said, with a glint in her eyes, “but as the years have passed, the thought has lingered. I knew I was not yet ready for such a sacrifice, and I was not even sure I wanted it.” But sometimes, when the world seems too noisy, when the spotlight is too bright, I think about the invitation and I wonder: what if?",
        " To the Severn and Wye Fishery, which is known for its reformed and responsible methods and its interest in the local fisheries, is given the responsibility of balancing commercial interests with the long-term conservation of the river’s biological balance. The choice of this establishment to be the new keeper of the river is a major change in the way this renowned stretch of water is regulated, and is both cause for hope and anxiety to anglers, conservationists and the local communities. The move is seen by some as a possible innovation in the management of rivers, based on private expertise and resources, but others fear that this will be at the expense of natural integrity. The agreement has not yet been published in detail, but it is believed that it will involve, among other things, responsibility for the management of the river, the prevention of pollution and the monitoring of fishing regulations. The fisheries will probably remain under the supervision and control of the environment agency, and the E.A. will probably maintain its right to inspect the work done by the smokery. During the consultation process, which will presumably be carried out soon, the future of the vital waterway will be discussed.",
        " A constable, a young fellow with a small, well-groomed moustache, held up the little stuffed animal again, leaning it on his knee, a plush toy, almost absurd. The floor was polished, and the fluorescent lights were humming a monotonous tune. \"We found it at the front desk,\" he said in a voice that was a mixture of astonishment and concern. \" No one has claimed it yet. It's a bear, but the fur is rumpled, and it's not easy to tell. A bit out of place, don't you think?\" He gestured with the bear towards the main hall, with its mad flurry of typing, ringing telephones and continual stream of incident reports and inquiries. They'd asked around, but no one had heard of it. \"It's the blouse,\" the constable said, scratching his head. \"Someone's been to a lot of trouble. It has a little police shirt, a bit faded, and a little badge sewn on, all of which seems a bit out of place.\" He pointed to a barely visible crest on the bear's tiny breast pocket. \"They can't just be bought. It has the crest of the Metropolitan Police Department, it seems.\" A child had probably lost it somewhere. He paused, his brows knit. \"I can't help thinking there's a story behind this....\" \"You know, you find things like this sometimes, that are in the wrong place, but they have something to tell you.\" He looked at the bear again, with an odd expression on his face. \"Anyway, I've filed a lost-and-found report. I don't think anyone's going to claim it, I don't think.\" He set the bear down gently on the counter with a sigh. He walked off, looking back at the bear with a lingering question. \" It's... strange, really.\" A tiny policeman's blouse, with its pin-pointed spangled vest, a soft, fluffy mystery, basking in the harsh glare of the fluorescent lights, stared back at him.",

        " He stretched out his hand, the bills rustled in the sudden silence, he pulled out the wad, mostly small ones, the result of a night at the café. The cold steel was pressing on his skin, and his forehead was sweating with nervousness. \" Slowly,\" his assailant said, his voice muffled by the scarf that covered his face; he could see only his eyes, cold, calculating. He felt like a pathetic offering to the monster who towered over him. \"Don't look at me,\" his assailant hissed, squeezing the knife with a new intensity. He reached out for the money, his money, a bridge between his fear and his hope of surviving. His assailant snatched it, the knife not wavering. The seconds stretched like an eternity, his heart beating furiously. He heard the rustle of cloth as the money was thrust into his pocket. He obeyed, staring at the cracks in the pavement. Then, a long time later, he heard footsteps, a retreat, and finally, the scream of a lone walker was gone. Slowly, cautiously, he raised his head. He sucked in a trembling breath that caught in his throat. The street was empty, he was alone. He was alive. The money was gone. He had been robbed. He hesitated. Should he call the police? His numb fingers found the telephone. But the image of the knife, the cold eyes, the terror—all remained seared in his memory. He didn't want to get involved. He just wanted to go home.

        " But the underdogs, predicted to fail by almost all, did not give up. The roar that burst from the stands seemed to lift the roof of the stadium off its feet, and the shock of the noise appeared to deafen the rivals. The favorites of the tournament, the first victims of the 1993 final, were already leading when, early in the game, Isabel Kerschowski scored the first goal. The equalizer, a great hook from outside the field, hushed the crowd; there was a general gasp that turned into murmurs of despair. They resisted the onslaught of the first attack and, slowly, tensely, they began to rise. The winners, visibly shaken, were making uncharacteristic mistakes; the pass went astray, the challenge became desperate, the walk of ease that had characterized their first game, was extinguished. Suddenly the tension, different from that of the beginning, shivered through the air. The underdogs, in the wake of their new confidence, defended themselves tenaciously, they took dangerous chances. The second half was a battle of strategies, of tensions, of hesitations, of hesitations; and both sides looked for the smallest opening. Then, with ten minutes left, the brilliant moment. A superbly measured ball gave the equilibriste a moment of freedom, and she touched the ball, she composed herself and slipped it under the despairing arms of the goalkeeper. Suddenly, a corner of joy burst from the travelers. Silence, the silence of shock. The final whistle announced victory, but also an earthquake. The favorites, crushed before their eyes, threw themselves at the enemy in the last breathless minutes; but the underdogs resisted, their defense was a wall of iron, and in the last, tense minute, they could only regret. The underdogs, against all odds, had achieved the impossible. The stadium, which had been filled with the cries of those who expected failure, echoed now with the cries of those who rejoiced in the face of astonishment. The pre-tournament favorites, who had not been beaten in the tournament for three decades, were out.who dared to dream. The competition had a new favourite, and a new story to tell.",

        " This unevenness of the extremes of the climate is largely due to the intensification of atmospheric rivers and the change in the rain.. Drought-prone regions, such as the Southwest of the United States and parts of Africa, can expect long periods of drought, with disastrous consequences for agriculture, livestock, and human populations. The phenomenon will aggravate drought in some areas and increase flooding in others. On the other hand, regions accustomed to moderate rainfall will see more violent and frequent storms. Coastal cities are exposed to increased risks of flooding and shoreline damage; while interior regions face the threat of flash floods and river overflows. The frequency and severity of water shortages will increase, as will the risk of wildfires. Long-term effects include the damage to roads, damage to agriculture in flood-prone regions, and the increased risk of water pollution. The increased rainfall can overload the drainage systems and cause widespread damage and displacements. Moreover, the humidity, which is a risk factor for the emergence of waterborne diseases, is conducive to the proliferation of waterborne diseases.",

The cause of the accident is under investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which has sent a team of experts to collect evidence and to investigate. Since the shopping center was not yet open to the public, the majority of the buildings were almost empty, which prevented a further loss of life.

They capture not just the energy of the performances, but also the atmosphere of unity and resistance in these concerts and events. In this way they show how music became a powerful force for social change in a small Yorkshire town.” * **Option 1: Focus on Shelton’s style of photography: “... Her style, both black and white and documentary, is edgy and urgent. Shelton’s photographs are close up, so we feel we’re in the middle of the action, and get a sense of the passion and commitment of both the performers and the audience.” * **Option 2: Focus on the bands’ legacies: “... These iconic bands, from far-flung places such as Pontefract, remind us of the way that punk and ska music spread out of the cities, energizing working-class communities across Britain, giving them music to dance to and sing along to.” These performances took place at a time of growing unemployment and racial tension in Britain. Their music and its message of equality continue to inspire new generations. Shelton’s photographs offer a valuable historical record of a defining moment in British cultural history.” How to choose the best option: *** The best continuation depends on the specific angle you want to emphasize.

        " Everest was too much to expect, the doctor said, but a mountain of moderate size, one that a man could climb without putting his life at risk. A daily mountain climb, according to Dr. Henry, improved both his body and his mind. His theory was based on the fact that climbing up the mountain would make a man's brain better, and that the climbing would release endorphins, which were a natural stimulant to the body and mind, just like the sun's light, which chased away the fog. He even had a mountain in mind, a local mountain that he called \"Knuckle\", because it looked like a fist pressed into the earth. But it wasn't just about physical. Mental strength, small victories, reaching the first ridge or navigating a section of loose scree, made the climber tenacious. The rhythm of the climb, the steady placement of the feet, could give rise to a meditative state, when the cares of the world were dispersed with each step. He was an example of this himself, if somewhat breathless; he was 62 years old, he had unruly gray hair and a rosy complexion, and he exuded energy that was not consistent with his age. Each ascent, however small, was a testimony to one's ability to persevere, and a tangible reminder that difficulties could be overcome, one step at a time. Dr. Henry wanted to spread his message; he had handed out leaflets to the neighbors, had spoken to his patients in the sparse waiting room, had even approached the embarrassed mailman. He went up the Knuckle every morning, whether it was raining or shining, with a thermos of lukewarm earl gray tea in his old backpack. But the people around him had mostly politely declined, complaining of aching knees or a busy morning schedule, if not a hesitancy towards strenuous exertion before nine. Mrs. Gable, a widow, was the exception.. Initially skeptical, she eventually agreed to accompany him on a \"gentle stroll\" up The Knuckle. After a week, she was hooked. She reported feeling more energetic, sleeping better, and even finding joy in weeding her garden, a task she had previously considered a tedious chore. Dr. McLaughlin, beaming with vindication, saw Mrs. Gable's progress as proof. He knew his theory wasn't a miracle cure, but he firmly believed that a daily mountain climb, metaphorical or literal, could be a powerful antidote to the malaise of modern life. He just needed to find a way to convince the rest of the world to take that first step.",

        " Analysts are trying to find out the cause. They are pointing to a report by the bank’s regulator that pointed to possible issues of solvency and, although only preliminary, suggested that a major slump in the economy could cause the bank to struggle to meet its obligations. Shares in the eighty-five percent tax-owned bank fell three percent on this news. Despite the fact that this may seem a small percentage, the loss is considerable, especially for a bank that is already in a precarious position. Although bank management has dismissed the report as too pessimistic and based on outdated data, the market seems to take it seriously. The thought of a state bailout arouses anger among the public, which remembers the bank’s previous difficulties and the burden they put on taxpayers. The next few days will be decisive for the bank. A rival bank is said to be interested in acquiring a majority stake in the bank, but only at a heavily discounted price. This would give the troubled bank some breathing space, but it would probably result in further losses for taxpayers and would also make people think about further concentration in the banking system. If the board is able to steer a course through this crisis successfully remains to be seen, but the future of the eighty-five percent tax-owned bank is hanging in the balance. The board’s next emergency meeting, at which they are to discuss the regulatory report, possible acquisition offers and how to reassure shareholders, is being closely followed.",

        " The usual rhythmic clatter, pulsating almost like a heartbeat, accompanied the early morning rush hour, the sound of the wheels gliding along the rails. And then this rhythmic clatter turned into a jarring metallic shriek. The train was just pulling out of Leuven at a slow speed, heading for Brussels. But the shriek grew louder, turned into a rattling, tearing, grinding sound that vibrated through the floor of the carriage. Heads turned, first with annoyance; someone muttered that new brakes were needed. A baby started crying, and its high-pitched cry cut through the rising noise. Coffee sloshed in the cups, newspapers shook. Cases and bags rained down on the passengers below, falling from the racks. The train lurched, and not in a gentle jolt, but a sickening sideways movement that threw the passengers from their seats. Outside the world was in turmoil; the orderly rows of bicycles beside the platform became a chaotic blur through the grimy windows. A heavy, oppressive panic was in the air. The train groaning, a long drawn-out lament of metal under enormous strain, it finally stopped with a thump, as though the earth had been shattered, and the bricks of the neat brick buildings jutted up at an alarming angle. The rhythmic clatter, the sound of the morning rush hour, was replaced by the silence of a disaster. The lights went out and the carriage was plunged into darkness, lit only by dim emergency lamps, and the only sound was the hoarse, frightened breathing of the survivors and the lonely wail of a baby clinging to its mother. The capital-bound train had been wrecked in an instant, in a tragic crash that had shattered everyone’s hopes.",

        " The first time, it was a strategic retreat, a strategic advance to a bigger prize. This time, however, it stung differently. For the second time, he was leaving a position he had earned rather than inherited. The first time he had left with his head held high, with whispers of “he’ll be back” following him along the corridors. This time, however, the whispers sounded less admiring, more forlorn. He was young and ambitious then, certain he would eventually outsmart the system. This time he had failed. He could have fought it. It had not been openly, not through dismissal, but with a thousand small cuts, with constant undermining, with a relentless flood of criticism. He could have fought a war of attrition, made his life miserable and clung to his job like a barnacle. But that would have been exhausting and in the end, useless. He knew the system inside out, knew the pressure points, knew the levers of power. The very things that had been his strength — problem solving, team-building, a sense of having made a difference — had been stifled by bureaucratic stifling, by petty politics. The joy had gone, the challenge had turned to an ordeal. He had earned his way here, the medallion was on the wall, and he traced the letters with his finger. “For Meritorious Service.” Meritorious Service. What a mockery of meritorius service! Merit had not been enough. He knew what he had to do. He would write his resignation letter. A sigh escaped from his lips. He would pack his things, his carefully arranged collection of photos and mementos that symbolized his life here. And then he would walk away.

        " The project’s ambition was to provide electric bicycles for hire at affordable prices, to promote sustainable transport and a healthy way of life in rural areas. The initial success in the region (name it: Scottish Highlands, Scottish Borders, etc.) gave rise to the hope that it might be extended elsewhere in the country. The Bike2Go scheme cost £155,000 and was the first of its kind in Scotland. Now the prospects of expansion would depend on the results of the pilot scheme, the prospect of convincing investors and the local authorities of the benefits of the system, and the question of adapting the concept to the specific needs of each region. But some problems remained: the need to raise funds for new stations, the problem of maintenance in remote areas, the need to generate sufficient demand to justify the investment. However, if the scheme was extended to other areas of Scotland, the author concluded, ‘there is a real opportunity for the expansion of a scheme which has shown that it can be profitable even in remote, rural areas.’",

        " A recent meeting of the council found the local members of the National Survey Authority so upset at the fact that the English name of Morfa Bychan is omitted from their maps. It is their contention that the maps, published by a national establishment, do not recognise the true status of the area, but do not recognize and promote the local name of Morfa Bychan. They say that such an omission is derogatory to the local culture and language, and they say that the name Morfa Bychan is the name used by the inhabitants of the district, and is one which they wish to encourage and retain. In the next revision they intend to request the authority to add the name Morfa Bychan to the Black Rock Sands, as they consider such a plan more suitable and respectable, as it accurately reflects the bilingual character of the district and reaffirms the local culture. They say that Morfa Bychan is the name that the people of the district have grown up with and love, and that the absence of it in the map is a derogatory to the efforts they make to encourage the Welsh language. This whole matter is an example of the still-persisting sensitivity surrounding place names and the importance of the correct presentation of local culture in cartography.

        " Defence lawyers have argued that the high degree of secrecy of the case prevents them from adequately representing their clients and preparing a proper defence. They point out that the defence is being deprived of access to critical evidence, such as medical records, records of interrogations and the detainees’ own accounts of their ordeal. The issue of secrecy, and particularly of the torture and abuse of the detainees, will form the focus of this week’s pre-trial hearing at Guantanamo Bay. The following points are likely to be at the centre of the arguments. * The extent of the Government’s classification authority. The defence will argue that much of what is being classified is irrelevant to national security and merely serves to hide the past misconduct of the government. The prosecution will argue that classified material is necessary to protect national security, intelligence sources and methods and ongoing operations and that releasing such material would compromise future intelligence operations and endanger lives. * The impact of secrecy on the fairness of the trial. The defence will argue that the high degree of secrecy prevents them from properly investigating the evidence against their clients, cross-examining witnesses and mounting a full defence, which infringes their clients’ rights to a fair trial. * The use of Protected National Security Information. The Government can designate information as PNSI and restrict access to it even to cleared defence lawyers, requiring them to use a secure facility to review it and to discuss it with their clients in certain circumstances. This pre-trial hearing is likely to have a significant bearing on the case as it proceeds to trial and on the broader issue of transparency in the management of national security. The Judge will need to balance the Government’s claims of national security with the right to a fair trial.matters.**",

The British referendum on European Union membership is scheduled for this year and the debate has begun. Leavers, or those who want to leave, often call themselves “Brexiters,” assert that the United Kingdom would be better off outside the European Union. They talk about how the United Kingdom would be able to take back control of its own laws, borders and economy, and that, having left the EU, it would be able to make new trade agreements with other countries. They are worried about the costs of European membership and the loss of national sovereignty. Both parties are trying to win support and the debate will probably intensify in the months ahead, with arguments over the issues of the free movement of people, economic growth, national security and the future of British identity.

She was 78 years old. “It is with a heavy heart that we announce the death of our beautiful, active, and one-of-a-kind mother,” the statement said. “She was a woman who loved life and always looked for adventures and opportunities to learn and grow. “Eleanor was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and friend. Her passion for art was evident in everything she did, from her home to her volunteer work at the local museum, to the way she treated others. She inspired a love of beauty and creativity in her children and grandchildren. Born in Chicago, she graduated from Northwestern University, majoring in art history. “Eleanor was a tireless advocate for her community, spending years at the local soup kitchen, organizing charity events for the library, and counseling and teaching young women in business. Her dedication to improving the world was an inspiration to all who knew her. A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on Saturday at St. Michael’s Episcopal Church. “Eleanor is survived by her husband of 55 years, David; her three children, Sarah (Michael) Golding, and Emily, and John Duke, and Thomas, and his wife, Jessica, and seven adored grandchildren, Chloe, Liam, Sophia, Ben, Henry, and Grace; and by her sister, Margaret Golding. She is also survived by her sister, Margaret, and a large extended family, who will be greatly missed.” We will cherish her memory forever, and we will strive to live our lives with the same grace, passion, and generosity that she embodied. “In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial donations be made to the Cancer Research Institute or to the local food bank.”",

Every day she woke up in a different town, and sometimes didn't remember where she was until she saw her bus parked outside her hotel. Each night, there were lights, sound, and the ecstatic faces of her adoring fans, singing along. It was here she had worked her whole life for.

        " The tumult of the public, the swell of the throng swept the ground like a wave, washed away the doubts that had tormented him for months. At every stroke, at every four, a fresh surge of the enthusiasm that there was more than an inning here, a statement. The man who was at 32, who had lost his touch, inspired his team with a double hundred when England had declared on 629 for 6 at Newlands. The bowlers who had looked so solid in the first inning were shaking under his unrelenting blows, and their accuracy was not what it had been. The fielders who had been so vigorous and alert in the first session, chasing after the leather ball, sagged and lost their stiffness with each passing hour. He was not just batting; he was dismantling the English attack, hammering the pieces in. As the sun sank and cast its long shadows across the ground, the 32-year-old reached his goal. At the other end, a young and inexperienced batsman, a mediocre player by his standards, saw in amazement the long game of the man who had passed the magic figure. He kept the strike going and his partner was making his attack more steady. He swung his bat; a tired but triumphant smile appeared on his face. He greeted the supporters, and there was not the slightest change in the ground. The fight was still on, and the bowlers were not going to break their backs. A flick behind the stumps, a two, brought him to the two-hundred, and the crowd erupted again in a roar of joy. The celebrations would have to wait for a day, but it was enough to make history. It would remind the world that, no matter how overwhelming the odds, a brilliant stroke could change the course of history, if only for a day.",

These are medicines mainly prescribed for ADHD, narcolepsy, and other serious conditions. ‘We understand the immense pressure young people are under to succeed at school,’ says a spokeswoman for the MRHA. ‘But the drugs can be extremely dangerous for people who don’t have these conditions. The side effects can include anxiety, insomnia and, in severe cases, heart problems and even psychosis.’ The MRHA has started a public awareness campaign for students, parents, and teachers to explain the dangers of using prescription drugs for non-medical purposes. ‘There’s no shortcut to success, and it’s a dangerous gamble with your health.’ The organisation is also working with e-commerce and social media to help prevent the sale and distribution of smart drugs without a prescription, and it wants anyone who suspects illegal activity to report it immediately. The campaign is using social media, websites, and leaflets to dispel the myths about smart drugs and to give information about safe, more sustainable ways to improve your grades, such as proper study skills, time management, and managing your stress. The MRHA is also working with health care professionals, and there is now a database where they can register anyone who has taken smart drugs for non-medical purposes, so that they can help anyone who feels under pressure to use them. The organisation wants to encourage open communication between students, parents, and doctors to help them to deal with any underlying problems that may lead to the use of smart drugs. Its message is that there are no shortcuts to success that don’t come with the risk of harming your health.",

She was found in a toilet in the Ataturk airport in Istanbul on the night of October 18th, and an autopsy was held on the 18th. * The missing money: The press reported that Sutton had a considerable amount of money to go to work in Iraq, and it was not known if it had been taken away. Her friends and colleagues, however, who are reluctant to believe that she could have committed suicide because of her stoic character, her previous experience of working in war zones, and the fact that she was heading for work which had excited her, have made other, more convincing arguments against a suicide verdict. * The work in Iraq: Sutton, who was working for the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, had worked on sensitive topics in conflict zones before, and this has been a cause of speculation about her death. * The quality of the investigation: There is criticism that the Turkish investigation was not thorough enough, and there is a demand for an independent investigation. The case remains complicated, in some ways sensitive, and as a result it has raised questions about the safety of journalists in dangerous regions. Although the official verdict on the death of Jacky Sutton remains suicide, doubts and unresolved questions about the incident continue to generate rumors and demands for an independent investigation.",
        " Now the Copper Box, once the crucible of Olympic triumph, now reverberated with a new and different life, with the energies of the people, the passions of the lower strata. No longer the thunderous roar of a thousand spectators but the excited cries of the teams, the rhythmic bouncing of the ball and the encouragements of the trainers. The familiar sound of the soles of trainers on the wood-chip was heard in the arena. The worn scuffs on the floor still visible from the Olympic battles were now testifying to a new generation of players making their own history on the hallowed ground. Children bursting with energy, with frenzied eyes, threw themselves across the arena, trying to grab the ball with their small hands, with their faces flushed with the exertion and joy of playing. Adults, reliving the days of the Olympic triumphs, or simply seeking a healthy form of recreation, were playing with new energy. It was a reminder that the Olympic games were not merely a spectacle, but an instrument of enduring and positive change. For many, this was more than a game. It was a living link with the Olympic past, a tangible link with the great emotions of the Olympic triumphs. So when the whistle blew at the end of the game and players gathered at the centre of the arena, with laughter and chatter, it was clear that the spirit of London was still with us, still active, still alive in the heart of the community. The renovated sports centre was more than a building. It was a place where dreams could come true and community ties could be consolidated.",

This is a good chance for both sides to try their fortunes and, should they score, to punish the other. For the home side, they are in the best position to score, but the visitors have an experienced batting team and a bowling attack which, while not the strongest in the division, is capable of exposing the smallest defect in the English technique. A victory for the home side would be an important step in the final struggle, and there will be a large crowd of enthusiastic supporters, who will be willing to bear the long summer hours and the heat in order to watch their team take one more step towards the coveted trophy.

It’s all too easy to fall into the trap of merely reacting, especially when you see policies being introduced which, in truth, are damaging the economy and the welfare of our people. But to say that we lack a visionary approach is quite unjust.” he said. “Take, for example, the way in which the present Government has dealt with the health service. While they focussed on reorganisation and bureaucracy, we came up with practical solutions, like investing in frontline services, tackling the crisis in waiting lists and giving the health boards the powers to act for the communities they serve. In fact, we have consistently offered the public a choice of constructive alternatives. We have been pushing for a more business-friendly environment, proposing targeted tax cuts to stimulate the economy, calling for simplification of regulations to encourage investment and a skills training system based on the needs of employers. This is not opposition for opposition’s sake, it is a fundamentally different approach, one based on localism and designed to deliver tangible results for patients. We are not afraid to challenge the status quo and sometimes this means disagreeing with some of the policies introduced by the present Government, but that disagreement should not be mistaken for a lack of vision. Our approach to economics is not just one of opposing the current Labour approach of nationalisation. It is one of creating the conditions for sustainable, private-sector-led growth that will create jobs and opportunities for future generations.” We shall present that plan at every opportunity.”",

In thirty years of living here I have suffered a lot of ill-health. It’s a subtle thing, you know. Now, almost every day, I wake up with a sore throat. My eyes are always burning and I have a dull ache in my whole body.” “But I know it’s the city. It comes on so slowly, you think it’s old age or the stresses of life, but I know it’s the city.” She waved her hand toward the bustling street just outside her balcony. “I used to walk everywhere. It’s the pollution, the noise, the constant hurry.” “Now, I find myself taking the metro more and more often, just to avoid the worst of it. And yet, that’s not the answer either. It’s a dead end, down there, with the same air coming up again.” “And I teach yoga. I teach about health and fitness, but sometimes I feel like a hypocrite. How can I live happily in a place where I am slowly being stifled?” A sigh, heavy with resignation, came from her lips.",

The atmosphere was saturated with the smell of the earth, and something else, something like a flower and very sweet. It was too perfect, too tranquil. I hesitated, my hand still on the door handle, an icy shiver running down my spine. We switched off the engine, and the sudden cessation of the noise increased the silence. We were alone, or seemed to be, at the edge of something unknown. The moon, hidden under a dense cloud, gave no light but the promise of an even deeper and more impenetrable darkness. It was as though I were standing on a stage awaiting a scene, and I was not sure that I wished to be present.",
        " This is a great change from the former belligerent, legal, and oppositional attitude. Legal action was not renounced; but a new spirit of co-operation with the British Museum and the British government had taken over. The Minister of Culture, to everyone's surprise, spoke of \"political and diplomatic action\" to obtain the return of the statues. “We believe that a prolonged and respectful dialogue, with the presentation of our commitment to preserve and exhibit these masterpieces, is the best way to succeed in the struggle,” he said. The minister said in an interview with foreign correspondents that the new strategy was to be a \"combination of diplomacy, culture, and art, \"high-level contacts with British officials, cultural and educational exchanges, international public opinion, which in its turn would also be encouraged. This turn to diplomacy was after years of failed legal action and a growing sense of frustration that the British Museum had not been persuaded to return the Parthenon sculptures, which are also known as the \"Elgin marbles.\" Critics were asked whether the new approach could be successful, as if it was to move the British Museum to return the sculptures by mere diplomacy. He admitted the complexities of the situation and the historical depth of the issue, but he maintained that a \"win-win\" solution was possible, either a long-term loan or the division of the curatorial work. It was up to Greece to build bridges and alliances and to demonstrate the historical and cultural importance of the reunification of the sculptures in Athens. But, on the other hand, proponents of the new policy argue that the changing international climate, with the new emphasis on repatriation, could create an opportunity for a new beginning.",

        " Such post-natal states were far more than mere melancholy. They were in reality disorders of the brain, with depression, anguish, anxiety, panic, obsessions, post-traumatic disorders, and in rare cases, post-partum psychosis. For the majority of mothers the post-natal state is happy and serene, but for a tenth of the women a completely different, depressing, and in the end disabling experience may follow childbirth. The symptoms can be expressed in a number of ways. The causes are complex and varied, a combination of factors, the stress of the new position, lack of sleep, the tension of the physical, and a lack of understanding in society and in the family. Sleep is a field of battle, and so is self-care. One woman may experience anguish and a hopelessness, a lack of interest in things she once loved; another woman may suffer from constant anxiety, obsessions, and panic attacks. The mother and the child may not get together, the child may develop a wrong way, and if the disorder is serious enough, there may be a thought of harming oneself or the child. If such disorders are left untreated, the consequences can be disastrous, not only for the mother but for the child and for the whole family. There is hope; the disorders are treatable, and with the proper help and care the women can recover and succeed. The therapies include psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT), medication, support groups, and changes in lifestyle. The most important thing is to ensure that every new mother knows she is not alone and that there is help. By raising awareness of the disorders and the treatments, making information accessible, and giving women the possibility of accepting help, we can help them find the joy of motherhood.",
        " It was a case of a councillor who, on his way to a meeting, in the course of a conversation, spoke disrespectfully and threateningly to a council employee. The councillor, who had been suspended from the council for five months from the day he was elected, was given a blanket ban on attending meetings, representing the council, or having access to council resources. The suspension was accompanied by debate within the council, where some councillors said they agreed with the committee’s decision and others were worried about the precedent it might set. Price claimed innocence throughout the trial, arguing that his behaviour had been misinterpreted and that he had been pursuing legitimate concerns about the council’s operations.",

The Secretary also mentioned that the Department’s efforts were geared toward strengthening security at airports, at borders, and at other critical infrastructure, as well as countering violent extremism on the Internet.

        " The local astrologer, who had served as assistant to the company, and now serving as its secretary, said a few words after the announcement of the vote. He said that his decision was not to stop free speech and criticism but to put the public’s safety and security first. He asked both the organisers of the march and the protesters to enter into a serious dialogue to prevent a confrontation. The motion effectively halted debate on the controversial motion, and bought time for all sides to think it over. The opposition parties, especially the Social Democrats and the Republicans, protested. They said it was a wretched dodge to get out of tackling the real issue that had led to the march, and that Fianna Fáil had decided to place the interests of the people behind the scene. Outside Leinster House the motion was greeted with anger and disappointment by the supporters of the march. Some members of the governing party, Fine Gael, cautiously welcomed the vote, saying that they could see there were genuine security concerns. They echoed the call for calm and asked all parties not to inflame an already volatile situation. The future of the proposed debate and of the planned march was uncertain. The organisers, while pleased that the march had been put on hold, were apprehensive that the protesters would find other ways to make their views heard. They accused the government of suppressing their right to protest, and said they would continue their efforts to raise awareness of their concerns. These coming days would be crucial to see if there was a chance of a peaceful solution or whether there would be a violent confrontation on the streets. The vote had only postponed the inevitable, leaving the simmering tensions of the moment in place.",

        " The struggle for the third airport runway had been going on for many years. The result was a complex and political game involving the interests of those with money to spend, of the environment and of politicians. The stakes were high: not only would the third airport be a major international hub airport, but it would also be a local economic gain. The prospect of increased employment and increased tourist numbers was in the foreground of the decision-making, and there was a lot of noise-reducing technology that promised less noise for the nearby inhabitants. The airport’s shrewd executive, Amelia Harding, was also taking no chances. In spite of this, the London airports were a formidable opponent. Supported by powerful shareholders and with years of political experience, they had a lot of room for maneuver. They even had ambitious plans to offset the increased CO2 emissions. They questioned the claim to the environment and the claimed safety of the smaller airport, suggesting that they were unrealistic and not sustainable. They also pointed out their own international connections and claimed that it was the most efficient way to ensure the UK's competitiveness abroad. The pressure was enormous. Public opinion was divided, with passionate arguments on both sides. The decision was up to the government, which was torn between the economic necessity of encouraging growth and the political reality of satisfying voters who were concerned about noise, the environment and the impact on the community. Amelia Harding knew that the final decision was imminent and that she had to get every word, every presentation, every argument right. She looked out of the office window at the roar of the airplanes taking off and landing, each one a symbol of the opportunities she was fighting for. She knew that it was more than a business deal, it was a fight for the future of the airport and the thousands of people who depended on it. And now she just had to wait and hope. It was a race to the finish line.",

The torrent swept away the river banks and blocked the drains. Houses and workshops were submerged, towns were isolated, roads impassable, the rescue services overwhelmed. The damage was estimated at millions, but the suffering of the victims was immeasurable.

        " One of the men, taller and fatter than the other, landed a crude blow, which bounced off the shoulder of the other. The earlier words and blows inside the brightly lit fast-food restaurant had evoked some stares and hushed whispers. Outside, in the half-light of a streetlamp, the dispute continued to escalate. A few late-night revelers, coming out of the nearby bars, watched as the commotion continued. Some of them cheered; others edged away. The other man, slender and agile, in turn threw a number of quick blows at the face of the larger man. The latter, momentarily stunned, stumbled backwards and tripped over the curb, landing hard on the sidewalk, groaning. A discarded hamburger wrapper, caught in a gust of wind, jumped between the two like a grim referee. The sirens of an approaching police car sounded through the night. The slender man, still clenching his fists, stood over him, panting. He seemed about to strike again, but then hesitated. The sirens got louder, the lights flashing alternately red and blue. He turned, gave the fallen man a last look, and fled down the dark, narrow streets. The police were almost there; the night was about to become more tense. The man on the ground moaned again, grabbing his head. The small crowd dispersed, slipping back into the shadows.",
        " This incident occurred at the Trafford Centre shopping mall in 2016. Actors played the role of terrorists, one of whom shouted Allahu Akbar (which means God is the Greatest) during a mock terror attack. The shouting of Allahu Akbar immediately caused a controversy in the Muslim community and amongst anti-racists, who argued that it strengthened negative stereotypes of Islam as being linked with terrorism. Incidents of this kind often raise several issues. The apology that followed was welcome by some, but the Muslim community called for further action to address systemic problems within the police and to ensure that future training exercises were carried out with greater cultural sensitivity and awareness. The apology came after years of campaigning and complaints. The police stated that the exercise was designed to test the response to a potential terrorist attack, but admitted that the mock scenario was inappropriate and failed to take account of the impact on the Muslim community. There was a call for a review of the planning and execution of future training exercises and for greater consultation with the Muslim community. The police also promised to improve diversity training for officers and promised to work more closely with Muslim community leaders when planning similar exercises. Incidents of this kind can have a negative impact on relations between the police and the Muslim community, and can raise concerns about policing and equality. The incident highlighted the need for ongoing dialogue between the police and the Muslim community to build trust and address concerns about discrimination and Islamophobia. The police made efforts to foster open communication and co-operation with community leaders to help avoid future misunderstandings. It was a reminder of the importance of cultural awareness. The damage done by the incident had to be repaired with sustained efforts and genuine commitment to tackling the underlying issues.sensitivity and awareness in law enforcement training and operations. It underscored the need for police forces to engage with diverse communities, to understand their perspectives, and to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes.",
        " The Norwegian scientists have warned that this thinning of the ice leads to several severe consequences. * * Reduced Albedo Effect: Thinner ice reflects less light and therefore absorbs more light from the sun, which then heats up the sea and increases the melting further. * * Faster Transition to Younger, Thinner Ice: * * * As a result, ice is more easily melted in summer and more easily broken by storms. Increased Erosion of Coastal Lands: * * * With less ice shielding the shores, coastal areas are subject to increased coastal erosiveness, and the risk of relocation increases. * * Disturbed Ecosystems: * * * Many Arctic species, including polar bears, seals and walruses, are dependent on thick, stable ice for hunting, breeding and resting, and the thinning and shrinking of the ice surface endangers their existence and disrupts the entire food chain. The Norwegian scientists are continuing their work and are especially interested in identifying the exact mechanisms behind the thinning of the ice and predicting future changes in the ice surface. * * Altered global weather patterns: Changes in the Arctic's sea ice are linked to changes in the world's weather patterns and may be responsible for increasing the number of extreme weather events in the mid-latitudes. * * Increased traffic: * * * With the thinning of the ice, the Arctic's seaways are also opening up, which could lead to increased pollution, noise and the introduction of noxious aliens. The Norwegian scientists also call for international cooperation in the face of the changing Arctic landscape. They call for urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to protect the vulnerable Arctic environment.",

The Lord Mayor issued a hastily written statement saying that he understood how the picture could be taken as a reflection of the “unflattering” images and sincerely apologized for any offense. The London Mayor admitted that his message, posted on his social media account, was “insensitive and crude.” He was a passionate supporter of the English team and wanted to express his delight with his fans. I now realize that I chose the wrong way and apologize without reserve, ”the Lord Mayor said. Opposition parties condemned the post and demanded that he resign for “ignorance” and “bad understanding” of the diversity of national minorities. Despite the apology, the reaction was immediate and considerable. Senior figures in the party were reported to have held an urgent meeting behind closed doors, where they compared the political costs of defending the Lord Mayor with the consequences of calling for his resignation. The reactions within the party were ambivalent. Some defended him publicly as a passionate supporter of football, but others were worried that the party's image would be damaged, especially in areas with a large minority. Others argued that the incident was a classic case of the misuse of the expression of patriotic solidarity, while others considered it a clear example of street and social prejudices. The controversy quickly spread beyond the party, it dominated the headlines in the newspapers and the social media blazed on.

        " In the following section I have tried to see how the events might unfold in several different ways. First I will try to continue the story with the available information. Kelly Mahon, of John Broad Avenue, was arrested after the infant was reported missing on February 24. The police immediately began an extensive search of the surrounding area, utilizing dogs, a helicopter and a search party of volunteers. Inspector Davies has stated at a press conference that the case is being treated as a high priority missing persons case, the priority being to find the infant as soon as possible. Detectives are currently questioning Mahon as to the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the child. Meanwhile the search party has been searching in the woods and along the waterways in the immediate vicinity, searching minutely and painstakingly. “We would like to urge anyone with any information, however insignificant, to come forward.” “The second option was to look at the possible reaction from the public, starting with the police revealing the infant’s disappearance. “I can’t believe it,” said Mrs Peterson, the neighbour next door. The news sent a shock through the quiet Arleston community. Many neighbours expressed concern and offered to help with the search. “I saw Kelly only yesterday and he seemed to be doing fine. What a terrible thing to happen.” The community, a tight-knit community, is pulling together and hoping for a happy outcome. In the village square, residents gathered to light candles and to pray for the child’s safe return. The local church opened its doors and people gathered there to give each other support. According to reports, Mahon, the infant’s father, has been experiencing some financial difficulties recently. Although the police have not released any further information, sources close to the investigation suggest they are exploring several possible motives. “Option 3 (Option to look at possible motives – but proceed with caution as this may be speculative): The police are investigating Mahon’s financial circumstances and his history of drug abuse. The family has also been known to be under the supervision of the social services in the past.s background and relationships to determine if any factors could have contributed to the infant's disappearance. However, authorities are urging the public to avoid speculation and allow the investigation to proceed. **Option 4 (A more neutral, factual approach):** Kelly Mahon, of John Broad Avenue, Arleston, was arrested after the infant was reported missing from his home on 24 February. He is currently being held in custody at Telford Police Station while detectives conduct their investigation. Police are appealing for information from anyone who may have seen Mahon or the infant in the days leading up to the disappearance. A formal statement from the police is expected",

        " A limit on the salary of teachers and \"real cuts\" in the budgets of schools are seen as a risk of weakening the schools, the education they get, in a general fall in the standards. The governments restricting the pay of teachers and \"real\" cuts in school budgets are a risk, they say, of lowering the quality of the teaching staff, the teaching aids, the quality of education. Moreover, budget cuts are followed by fewer resources for essential programs and services, fewer aides to help students with special needs, fewer extra-curricular activities to complement learning, less investment in essential equipment and technology, a general decrease in the quality of the school environment. And the lack of staff would lead to the schools not being able to fill the vacancies and having to rely on less qualified personnel. These warnings are often accompanied by calls for the government to change its education policy and put the investment of teachers and resources above all. Critics say that the education of people is the best investment for the long term, the best way to ensure economic prosperity and social mobility. The underfunding of schools, they say, is a false economy that will harm future generations and further increase the gaps. Some propose new funding systems, either through higher taxes or the reallocation of existing resources, to ensure that schools have the necessary resources to provide a high-quality education for all.",

        " In other words, Kansai Electric Power (Kepco) is free to re-start the third and fourth units of the Takahama Plant in Japan. The only requirement is to pass local approval. In its decision, the court is likely to have weighed the arguments made by Kepco about strengthening of the plant structure and improving emergency procedures. The injunction of June 2016 was issued by the same court, on the grounds that the plant lacked the means to cope with an accident, in particular earthquakes. The reversal of the injunction reflects a change of view of the same court on the issue of safety. On the other hand, the judgment may be appealed by the plaintiffs of the injunction. It is also possible that the mayor of Takahama and the governor of Fukui will protest against the local approval. Moreover, this decision is likely to face strong opposition from the local population, concerned about the possible dangers of the re-start of the plant. Local approval could therefore be time-consuming and politically sensitive.",

        " His physicians declared that it was a miracle he was alive, let alone that he recovered. He had suffered many fractures, and was three weeks in a coma, after being knocked down at his door in Swanmore last October. He awoke to find himself in a strange and inconceivable world, and that all that was familiar and soothing had been broken with his femur. He could not remember the accident. But the first joyfulness of awakening was followed by an agonizing infirmity. Every day his wife came to see him, and her face showed a deep anxiety, which deepened more each time he flinched. He was, in his body, which was as strange to him as a dead body, a prisoner of a hospital bed, amid the stench of disinfectants and the mute whisper of gentle nurses. The last memory he had was that of watering his prize-roses, the scent of which still lingered in his finger-tips, which had lost their sensitivity. As his bodily convalescence went on, so did his determination to collect the fragments which were scattered about him. The police investigation had ended in a void, and he had a great memory-hole and the festering wound of unanswered questions. His wife recounted the facts as they understood them: an accident, no witnesses, a dark car which had gone off. Then he thought of the road, the lane in front of his house, and of the familiar figure of Mrs. Higgins with her terrier. He began with the roses, clutching at the memory of their flaming colours, their delicate petals, their smell of the earth. He flinched, and cried out with the phantom pain of the collision in his breast. One day, during a particularly trying physiognomy, he saw, as if in the mist, the flash of something metallic. It was not a definite image, but a glimpse, the gleam of chrome as it reflected the setting sun. He flinched. He struggled, and the glimpse vanished.articulate the fragmented image, the half-formed memory. \"Chrome... I saw chrome... a glint of light...\" Eleanor squeezed his hand. \"Maybe... maybe it's a start.\" But Felix knew, deep down, that it was more than just a start. It was the beginning of a long and arduous journey to uncover the truth, a truth that lay buried somewhere in the wreckage of his memory, waiting to be unearthed. He wasn't just healing his body; he was determined to heal his mind, to find the person who had shattered his life and left him for dead on the side of the road. The roses could wait.

        " The race began frenziedly, in a hurry, in a hurry, among the elbows and the spikes. Many might have thought that she was lost. Pavé, her face set in a determined expression, in spite of the sleepless nights of motherhood, made the choice of a racer who had given up her place to save energy. She moved quietly, efficiently, a silent hunter watching his prey. It was true that she was forty years old, a new mother, and that she was going against younger and more agile runners. But Pavé knew herself, knew her body, and knew the race. The number of laps was diminishing, the number of runners was diminishing. The heat of the track, which added to the discomfort, radiated from the ground, but Pavé was not bothered. She looked at the leaders, watched them breathe, studied their breathing, followed their subtle changes in figure. With five laps to go, she began to increase her speed gently, with a slow and silent screw. The pacesetters, at the first moment, began to stumble, their faces distorted by suffering. It was Pavé's hour. Two laps remained, she was on top, her eyes fixed on the goal. Some tried to follow her, but the inexorable rhythm, the metronomic rhythm of her step, broke them. The last lap. The public roared, feeling the weight of the moment, the improbable triumph that was happening before their eyes. We could hear her breathing, deep, sonorous, regular, but she remained impeccable. Down the home stretch, the shout of the crowd rose higher, a wave of sound washed over him, the goal was approaching, he saw her. His legs were burning, his lungs were screaming, but she continued, her legs still well provided with the memory of Paula Radcliff's victory, her family, the stubbornness of a career. The clock stopped. She rushed, she threw herself, she seized the last energy she had, she crossed the line with a desperate, a last effort. She fell on the track, tears in her eyes, overwhelmed by her emotion. Jo Pavé, a mother of two, at the age of forty, had done it. The gold.streaming down her face. A moment of pure, unadulterated joy. A victory for experience, for perseverance, and for the enduring power of the human spirit. A victory that would inspire mothers everywhere, a testament to the fact that anything is possible, no matter the challenges life throws your way. The perfect tactical race, indeed.",

        " The play, provisionally entitled “Mapp and Lucia,” will be played by the same person, who, in the novel, plays Lucia, a social climber with a playful air. Mr. Pemberton, who is known for his depravity of comedy and his skill as an actor, will produce the series for the BBC. The role of Miss Mapp, a fierce rival, has not yet been cast. Pemberton's appearance probably promises to be different from the other, more elegant, perhaps a little stale, Benson adaptations that have been seen in the past. According to people close to the production, the adaptation will include the sharpness of wit and the satirical tone of the Benson novels, but will also show the insecurities and weaknesses of the characters. The series is expected to be a multi-part series, focusing on the frequent schemes and petty rivalries of the two characters in the social world of the imaginary town of Tilling. Speculation about the names of possible actresses has started, with the names of Imelda Staunton and Olivia Colman mentioned. The BBC hopes to secure a prominent actress to play opposite Pemberton, so that the relationship between the two characters is interesting and comic. Production is scheduled to begin in the spring, with a release date in the late spring of 2024. You can expect a lot of secretly hostile comments, garden parties gone awry, and the incessant struggle for social supremacy.",
        " Today, four days after the start of the fight against corruption, the public, after the initial joy of demonetization, is frustrated and angry, especially in the people. In the last four days, queues have continued to form outside the ATMs, people have tried to exchange their currency in them. Now they are exchanging information on the social network and through telephones to find out which ATMs are really distributing money. Many ATMs are now emptying again after being refilled. There are some which are completely out of service, with notices saying “No cash” or “Technical failure”. Various anecdotes are being circulated of people fainting in the queue, and some people coming forward with water and help. The shops and shops are going bankrupt. People with health problems and the elderly are suffering especially, they have to stand for hours in the scorching sun or in the cold evenings. The informal economy, which is largely cash-based, has almost collapsed. There is a decrease in trade, the buyers have no money to pay the sellers. The daily workers have no work and the bosses have no money to pay them. It has been announced that the government is working to increase the supply of new currency notes, and that the ATMs are being calibrated to distribute new currency notes. However, the public in the queues is not really convinced by the assurances of the government. The government urges patience, it says that the situation will improve soon. The hopes of quick relief are fading, and the anxiety for the next few days and weeks is growing.",
        " The resulting amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act will lift the ban on lawsuits against foreign governments in cases of terrorism on American soil. On Wednesday, Congress voted to impose a new law on the family members of the almost three thousand victims of the September 11 attacks, allowing them to sue the Saudis for their alleged role in the attack. The JASTA law, named after its sponsor, Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr., was rejected by President Obama, who later overrode it. But the law also sparked a great deal of controversy. Those who supported JASTA argued that it was a necessary first step to holding the Saudi government accountable for its involvement in the attack and the need to avenge the victims and their families, who had long awaited the opportunity to file lawsuits. But the opposition, which included President Obama and some foreign policy experts, argued that JASTA would violate the principle of sovereign immunity and expose U.S. diplomats, military personnel and intelligence agencies to possible lawsuits abroad, which could undermine the country's foreign policy. The Saudi government has repeatedly denied all involvement in the September 11 attacks and lobbied against the law. The passing of JASTA has also led to a tense and uncertain relationship between the two countries. It is a strategic alliance that is indispensable for regional stability and the fight against terrorism. The case is still pending, and JASTA is still in progress. The law, which was passed, allowed the families of the victims to sue the Saudi government, and the lawsuits, which were complex and lengthy, were full of legal arguments over the evidence and the extent of the possible liability of the Kingdom.",
        " The driver, a man in his late twenties, said he was just driving it up the road and that he didn’t think it was a problem, but the police thought otherwise. The policemen, rightly surprised by the dangerous load, towed the car to the side of the road. The police gave the driver a ticket forbidding him to continue his journey with the sofa as it was. The sofa, tethered in parts and protruding from the boot, posed a major danger to other road users. Falling debris could have caused an accident, and the restricted visibility from behind was also a real danger. In the post, which featured the absurdly oversized sofa crammed into the back of the sporty Toyota Celica, the police amused the public with the policeman’s comical reasoning. Many of the comments were concerned with the sanity of the driver and the possible route of the sofa. The police also warned him of the dangers of loose loads and advised him on how to transport large objects in future. This incident is a humorous reminder of the importance of road safety and careful cargo transport. The sofa’s final route is unknown, but it is likely that the sofa had to go via some more appropriate transport means.",

Some have lost limbs and are paralyzed; others suffer from chronic pain and other forms of disability which impair their quality of life and rob them of their opportunities for employment and their peace of mind. The effects of these injuries go beyond the individual to the family and community. “Moreover, the needs of these individuals are often complex, requiring specialised care, including occupational and physiotherapy, psychological support and the provision of appropriate assistive devices.

These disabilities are a constant reminder of the violence and the suffering of the past, a reminder which undermines the healing process. In the process, family members are often left to take on the burden of caring for their loved ones, which brings its own emotional and financial difficulties. “The well-being of these survivors requires addressing the gaps in the existing system of services, making their needs better known and ensuring that their experiences are acknowledged as part of the story of the Troubles.

I was about to succumb to the terrors of panic when I had my first impression. The smoke was thickening, but the fire was still under control, at least for the moment. Instead of escaping, I took a deep breath and began to survey the situation. We were a team and I couldn't fail. I said, \"Heads down, calm down\"; I was cutting through the growing fear. My first priority was to calm the passengers near me. I began to talk to them in a clear, firm voice, to reassure them that we would get through together. I walked briskly, went to the passengers who were suffering the most, offered them water, a word of comfort. \"Cover your mouths with whatever you have; we'll follow procedure and get everyone out safely.\" This was no longer just a job for me, it was a responsibility, a promise to protect the people entrusted to me. My eyes scanned the cabin for any immediate danger, for passengers in need of immediate assistance. We had a procedure and we were going to follow it.

The golden sands of Sousse were already again crowded with families and bathers. And yet the atmosphere had changed. The happy cries and laughter were muffled, with a certain anxiety. The presence of the armed security men sweeping the beach, a visible reminder of the recent brutal blow, emphasized the sensitivity that had been revealed. The empty sunbeds testified to the lives lost, to the happiness that had been shattered. It was a resolute gesture, a symbol of resistance, but it was also a fragile first step towards the return to normality, to a country dealing with the incomprehensible sorrow of a life devastated by the horrors of terrorism.

The need for the economic benefit of the improved connexion with the need for the conservation of the environment are both felt keenly by the engineers and the engineers also must take into account the wishes of the local people and must take into account their apprehensions as to noise and the effects of the construction. The various possibilities are being compared with one another and are being assessed with reference to the impact on the local fauna, including the endangered stocks of salmon and the fresh-water pearl-shells.... Also the new crossing must not in any way damage the historical interest of the locality.

        " Mr. Lewandowski stood before the judge, his face a mask of carefully controlled calmness. Now, I will continue the story as follows, based on the prompt that Mr. Lewandowski is charged with simple assault for his encounter with the former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields, based on publicly available information about the case, but with the proviso that this is a fictional story based on the prompt. The charge of assault dates back to several weeks ago, when Mr. Lewandowski, then an employee of a prominent presidential candidate, was involved in a case at which Michelle Fields, then a reporter for Breitbart, wanted to ask the candidate a question and Mr. Lewandowski grabbed her by the arm to prevent her from doing so. The courtroom was packed with journalists, political activists and inquisitive onlookers. They were, of course, planning to question Michelle Fields about her own experience. The prosecutor’s office, in the person of a seasoned lawyer, Mrs. Harding, laid out the case methodically, beginning with the arrest warrant, which contained Michelle Fields’s account of the incident. “Your Honor,” Mrs. Harding stated in her opening statement, “this case is about the most basic of human rights: that of the right to bodily integrity. In a deliberate act of violence, the defendant forcibly, against her will, touched Michelle Fields against her will, thereby causing her bodily harm. She also intended to show the jury photographs of the bruises on Michelle Fields’s arm, and if necessary to call other witnesses who might have witnessed the incident. The defense, in the person of an experienced and resourceful lawyer named Mr. Abrams, vehemently denied the charge, arguing that the prosecutor’s case was based on exaggeration and political motives. “We will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Lewandowski is guilty of simple assault,” Mr. Abrams declared. “This case is a political sham. The defendant, as campaign manager, was charged with the responsibility to protect the candidate from aggressive journalists.maintain order. Any contact was incidental, unintentional, and certainly not of the nature to constitute battery. We will demonstrate that Ms. Fields' account is unreliable and that the evidence does not support the prosecution's claim.\" The trial began. The prosecution called Michelle Fields as their first witness. She testified in detail about the incident, describing the feeling of being grabbed and pulled back. She maintained that she was simply trying to do her job as a reporter and that Lewandowski's actions were unwarranted and intimidating. During cross-examination, Mr. Abrams relentlessly challenged Fields' account. He questioned her about her motives, her previous reporting, and inconsistencies in her statements to the police and in media interviews. He suggested that she had embellished the story for personal gain and to damage the candidate's campaign. The prosecution then presented the photographs of Fields' arm, which showed",

The government could be forced to go back to the EU to try and negotiate a better deal (which is very unlikely). A no-deal exit would happen if no agreement was reached before the deadline. An extension of Article 50 would be sought to give more time for a deal to be agreed. Some think that if Parliament cannot agree, then the public should be given a second vote. * * * Who are the key players? * * * * * * The government – * * * It will strongly oppose the amendment. A meaningful vote weakens its negotiating position and makes it more likely that its deal will be rejected. It will whip its MPs to vote against it. * * * The opposition parties – * * * These will generally support a meaningful vote, although they may have different ideas about what should happen if the deal is rejected. They will whip their MPs to vote for it. * * * Rebel Conservative MPs – * * * This is the crucial group. If enough Conservative MPs vote for the amendment against the government, it could pass. Their motivations are often concern for the economy, concern for particular industries and the wish to avoid a no-deal exit. The DUP – * * * It is a very tight call. It is a key part of the government’s negotiating team, but it could still back the amendment if it thought it was in its interests.* **What are the possible outcomes of the vote?** * **Amendment passes:** This would be a major defeat for the government and a significant victory for those who want Parliament to have more control over the Brexit process. It would increase uncertainty about the future of Brexit. * **Amendment fails:** The government would be in a stronger position to proceed with its Brexit plans, but it wouldn't necessarily mean a smooth path ahead. Opposition parties and rebel MPs could still find ways to challenge",
        " And so the site of Stonehenge can be thought of no longer as a mere place of worship, but as a busy place for many centuries before the erecting of the famous stones. The discoverer, Professor David Jacques of the University of Buckingham, made the discovery at Blick Mead in October and said the dating of the finds had just been confirmed. He believes that this is a site where people gathered and feasted and lived, a link between us and the prehistory of Stonehenge. He has discovered evidence of feasting, in the form of butchered animal bones and charcoal, along with flint tools and other artefacts.",

        " A sign announcing Chocolate Scotch Eggs in a crooked hand proclaimed “A Duns Delight.” Foston’s Scottish Deli in Duns is selling Scottish eggs with a chocolate twist. She eyed the glass display case warily, among the rows of plump pork sausages and well-marbled steaks, these... aberrations. Mrs. MacTavish, who has shopped in the deli for more than thirty years, squinted at the sign. “Angus,” she called out, her voice cutting through the butcher’s usual humming. They looked deceptively ordinary at first glance: golden bread crumbs in a vaguely egg-like shape, but then the eye caught a glimpse of chocolate under the cracks in the crumb coating, or the menacingly dark brown of the ‘meat’ that surrounded the egg. Angus Foston, the owner and purveyor of fine and now apparently bizarre meats, beamed. “Ah, Mrs. MacTavish! What in the name of Haggis are those?” “Chocolate scotch eggs! A little Foston’s experimentation. You’ve noticed our new creation?” He winked, and Mrs. MacTavish shivered, because she knew what he meant by ‘sweeter palate.’ It was the gaggle of adolescent girls who frequented the park, running on Irn-Bru and questionable decisions. “Chocolate and eggs, Angus?” she repeated, astonished. “It’s not just any chocolate, Mrs. MacTavish. It’s...” He gave a nervous grin. “It’s a dark chocolate, and the ‘meat’ isn’t meat at all! It’s a rich chocolate brownie – spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg.” His smile faded. “The egg is cooked in the brownie, Angus. I think I’ll take a wee bite.” He paused, as if to get the nod of approval from his seasoned shopper.impressed. She wasn't. \"And the egg?\" she asked, bracing herself. \"A perfectly free-range, hard-boiled egg, of course! It provides a lovely... textural contrast.\" Mrs. MacTavish pinched the bridge of her nose. \"Angus, I've bought my Christmas goose from you for decades. I trust your judgment. But this... this is an insult to the very concept of a scotch egg. And possibly to chocolate itself.\" Angus's smile faltered. He knew Mrs. MacTavish was a bellwether of Duns' culinary tastes. If she didn't approve, the Chocolate Scotch Eggs were doomed. He leaned closer, lowering his voice. \"Alright, Mrs. MacTavish, between you and me... my nephew, Hamish, came up with the idea. He'",

        " Former ministers, particularly those of the Ben Ali regime, have been controversially accepted. The Tunisian elections, expected in December, are to be characterized by the deep divisions which persist, since the year of the uprising of the Arabs. The rejection of these people, according to their partisans, would be undemocratic, and would provoke a greater polarization. According to them, the situation could lead to a corruption and a bribery, to a possible obstacle to reforms, and the interest of these people would be defended, if it came to them. On the other hand, those who are in favor of the election affirm that their exclusion would be unjust and would aggravate the divisions in the country. And they argue that these people have experience and know-how that can benefit the country's development. They maintain that all people, whatever their past, should have the right to participate in the political life, provided they comply with the law. Hence, the elections represent a test of the transition to democracy in Tunisia. The international community is watching this country to see if it can serve as a model of democracy and social cohesion in the region. The country will be judged on whether it will consolidate its democratic achievements or succumb to the counter-revolutionary temptations that threaten to undermine the achievements of the Arab Spring.",

For the most part Wales had dominated the play, but it was only thanks to the powerful downward flick of his head that a corner from the left was able to breach the Cypriot defence.

        " And with that came an exhilarating explosion from the crowd, and a feeling of relief from the Tottenham fans after a dismal first half against a well-organized, high-spirited Blackburn side. Ben Davies rose to meet Dejan Kulusevski’s delicately weighted cross and scored a goal that lifted the Spurs up. The goal had been scored only a dozen minutes into the second half, but it gave the players fresh momentum. The old Blackburn captain, masterful in deploying his side’s resources, had kept the team under control and then swooped in to exploit the gaps between their defence and their midfield. But now Ben Davies’ goal changed everything. Until then the team had looked sluggish, uninspired and frankly, just plain boring. The appearance of Richarlison at half-time had also made a considerable difference. He had chased down every ball, harassed the Blackburn defence and made space for his colleagues. Suddenly the passing became sharper, the movement more energetic. The chances came thick and fast, and on two occasions Richarlison had forced the goalkeeper into fine saves. After conceding the goal, Blackburn struggled to recover their poise. The midfield, which had been so prominent in the first half, began to tire and Spurs began to create opportunities. The half-time problems faded into a distant memory. The mood among the supporters had become buoyant, sensing that victory was now within reach. Spurs, sensing victory, pushed on, determined to score more. This was a very different side to the one that had played so poorly in the first half. The head of the Welshman had set the spark flying.",
        " Beyond the circulating pictures and the enthralling videos, the ISS is a major research laboratory, a testing ground for new and future devices, and a symbol of international cooperation. It is easy to become fascinated by those indifferent pictures, which show human life in the frigid void of space. But to call the ISS a mere playground for talented people would do a great injustice to the years of work, the technological innovation, and the science it represents. This unique environment has been used to carry out experiments impossible on Earth in the fields of medicine, materials, and biology. Medicine: the study of the body’s adaptation to long-term spaceflight, such as the loss of bone density, the atrophy of muscle tissue, and changes in the immune system, provides critical data that can be used to improve treatments for these conditions, particularly in the elderly. Among other things, research on the crystallization of drugs in microgravity has helped to develop better medicines. To understand fluid dynamics in zero gravity is crucial to developing more efficient engines, more effective cooling systems, and improved industrial performance. Earth observation: the ISS provides a unique vantage point for monitoring our planet, for tracking changes in the climate, for observing natural disasters, and for studying the functioning of the Earth’s complex systems. In this way we have discovered more resistant alloys and more efficient solar panels. Furthermore, the ISS is a key step in our space exploration, as a laboratory for developing the procedures and procedures for long-duration missions to the Moon, to Mars, and beyond. It provides the experience, the know-how, and the solutions for living and working in space, which are essential to these ambitious missions. The ISS is also an example of the power of international cooperation, in a world often divided by disputes and competition. It is a project involving several countries, which each contribute their know-how and their equipment to achieve a common goal. And so while Chris Hadfield’s guitar and his song reach millions of people, the ISS is also an experiment in cooperation.Scott Kelly's somersaults may capture the public's imagination, they are merely the surface of a much deeper and more profound reality. The ISS is not just a space station; it is a symbol of human ingenuity, scientific progress, and international cooperation, a vital asset for our future in space and on Earth. It is a serious point, indeed, a point about pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and capability.",

        " “But that’s the trouble with Sharnford, it’s a dangerous place. ” The group said that the ravages of high-speed cars had been particularly felt on the A447 road through the village, where the speed limit was thirty miles an hour. The traffic group said that there had been eye-watering speeds, in excess of one hundred miles an hour, in which a serious accident was only a matter of time. It was just too scary, especially for families with small children or elderly residents trying to cross the road. “We’re not talking about a few miles over the limit,” said the group’s spokesman. “We’re talking about speeds three times the legal limit.” “We realise the police are stretched,” he added. “But this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed and soon.” The group had used speed detection equipment, which they called speed indicator devices, to measure the speed of cars and had shown their results to both the county council and the police, who, it was said, were encouraging the use of average speed cameras to monitor speeds. On top of that, STAG said that they wanted physical changes to the roads, such as speed bumps or chicanes, to deter speeding drivers. The group believed that only a combination of traffic speed controls and road improvements would help to reduce speeds and make the roads safer for everyone. “We can’t wait for an accident before we do something,” said the spokesman.",

        " While he was on board the International Space Station, he was on a six-week mission, and was speaking to a group of schoolchildren assembled at the Science Museum in London. “It has been an amazing experience,” he said in a slightly cracking voice through the satellite connection, “and to be able to see our beautiful planet from up there, gives one a completely new view of things.” “Are you doing any experiments up there?” a young girl with pink ribbons in her hair asked in a voice barely audible over the general hubbub. The children, their voices in a buzz of excitement, held up their self-drawn pictures of rockets and planets, eager to catch a glimpse of their hero floating weightlessly on the screen. “Of course, we’re doing plenty of experiments up here. We’re carrying out a whole lot of research.” Thomas Peake’s face was illuminated by the faint glow of the ISS. He then went on to show the children a small closed container, in which tiny green shoots were sprinkling. “We’re trying to see how the absence of gravity affects the development of the plants. One of the things we’re looking at is how plants grow in microgravity.” He also showed them a simple experiment with water, a drop of water that in the absence of gravity, made a perfect sphere. The children shrieked with astonishment as the water sphere sailed on in a weightless arc. “Perhaps in future, we’ll be able to grow our own food on long-term space missions.” “It’s like magic!” a boy shouted. Thomas Peake smiled. “It’s not magic, it’s science, and any of you can be a scientist if you keep on asking questions, if you never stop looking for things, if you never stop being curious about the world, and for that matter the whole universe.” In the end, he gave the children a last piece of advice: “Work hard, think big and then anything can happen, even becoming an astronaut.” The live link continued for another half an hour, with Thomas Peake answering questions about his training, the food he eats, and how he sleeps without a pillow. Then, at the end of the half-hour session, the connection went off, and the children whose imaginations were kindled by this encounter, whose spirits had been soaring, went home.",

But they did not merely see discarded tires and broken household appliances; they saw death. The mass of rubble and rubbish reeked of death, and the stench was not confined to the dump. The closer they came, the more they breathed in the acrid, metallic stench, with a hint of something indefinable and suffocating. The March stench attracted the residents of the city to the rubbish-heap, but as they approached the stench got more and more overpowering. (Alternate version, more suspenseful) The March stench drew them closer. The path, which had once been an indistinct game trail, opened into a clearing, and there, beneath the sparse branches of a dead oak, they saw what they could not have expected to see. Their curiosity turned to terror. They had stumbled upon the stench, hoping it was just a dead animal, but the stench got stronger and stronger, suffocating, and at last they saw it, a rusty barrel lying on its side, leaking a thick, dark liquid into the parched ground. The stench was stronger and stronger with each step. They could not breathe; their throats were raw with the stench.

        " Also, access to European research programs such as Horizon Europe is a great concern. The higher education sector was largely in favor of staying in the UK and has since expressed its concerns about the financial implications of leaving the EU. The main concern is that it will no longer be able to benefit from European research programs such as Horizon Europe. For universities in the UK, these programs have historically supported many high-level projects and have facilitated interdisciplinary research in many areas. The possibility of recruiting and retaining excellent foreign academics and scholars from all over Europe has also been an important part of their success. Consequently, replacing this funding with domestic alternatives is seen as a challenge, both in terms of size and the well-established international networks associated with the EU programs. In addition, the possible decrease in the number of international students, especially from European countries, is a serious financial risk. During the course of Brexit, new obstacles and uncertainties have been created for the access of European citizens to the UK, which makes it more difficult and perhaps less attractive for Europeans to work and study in the UK. This “brain drain” could seriously undermine the quality and competitiveness of British science and education. The higher education sector has also actively demanded support and changes in policy from the government to reduce the negative impact of Brexit. Changes in visa regulations and the impression that the UK is less hospitable to foreigners could lead to a decline in the number of foreign students, thereby weakening university budgets. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * But the universities have also been active in developing and enhancing their international collaborations and attracting world-class talent.",

Others stayed, huddled together, licking their wounds, thinking about the long, damp trip home. For today at least, the dream of Old Trafford had been washed away.",
        " The party was joyous, a sea of blue and white flooded the stadium as the whistle sounded. The fans hoisted the players on their shoulders, and sang, ‘King Jock, King Jock!’ * It was with a smile that Robinson saw his name enshrined in history and won back the First Division in the following May, ending their seven-year spell in the Second. And that not only meant prestige and security, but a return to the First Division and a chance to regain their freedom. It was a moment that carved itself into the history of the club, a testimony to his genius, and the boundless spirit that he sowed in his players.",
        " The tension in the air was tangible, crackling around the water cooler, and reverberating through the open office. Last week’s failure was a disaster, crippling the entire system for a crucial twenty-four hours and revealing flaws no one had expected. After last week’s experience, many were doubtful the system would hold up. Every click was a test, every save a gamble. Now, with the quarterly reports due, the system was creaking with the strain. It was only, “A minor setback, lessons learned.” But the whispers spoke of an outdated network, a lack of redundancy, and management more concerned with cost cutting than long-term security. And the steady green glow of the server’s health indicator in the corner of her screen flickered with a flickering green light, which was as much a threat as a sign of safety. Hunched over her files, Sarah felt her stomach clench in a tight knot. The report was weeks in the making and the thought of losing it all again was enough to make her lose her nerve. Mark was on the phone. His voice was tight with frustration, “Yes, I know the deadline is today,” he snapped, “but the system is barely functioning!” He hung up with a sigh and ran his hand through his already rumpled hair. “I told them so, I thought. I can’t save my files!” The question wasn’t about the technology, it was about people. He had warned of the impending strain months ago, but his concerns had been dismissed as “unnecessary alarmism” and now the system was falling to pieces. People sensed it. They stood on the edge of a cliff, waiting for the inevitable to happen. Did they have the skills, the knowledge, the leadership to survive the oncoming storm? Would they learn from their mistakes or would they repeat them? No one knew when the fall would come, or how it would come.",
        " Despite the lack of a contract extension, it is known that he is eager to take his place in the squad and hopes to make his debut in the next game against the team. The striker, who was a free agent after his contract at Mansfield Town expired, is said to be in good shape. The new manager, who is delighted with the signing, said, “We have admired [Player's Name] for a long time. He has a lot of skill and is keen on scoring goals, so we have something different to offer in the offensive line. We will increase the popularity of the team by adding this player and going up the league ranking. ”",
        " “Meanwhile, I must report that the first ailment of my dear friend and teammate, one of the few Argentines who has reached the Superliga, is a chronic hamstring injury, for which the doctor has prescribed rest and physiotherapy. He will probably miss the next few matches of the team.” The exact time of his return to the field is uncertain, but the hope is that he will be able to return to the pitch in a few weeks and will again be able to help Kasimpasa in the Superliga. The club has promised to work closely with the medical staff of the local hospital to ensure that the player returns to health as soon as possible.",
        " A Tredegar sailor, Pierre Cornalor, distinguished by his calm and sound sense of duty, a petty officer, as it were, among the most highly esteemed of the Navy, he was thirty years in the service, he had seen action in the Falklands, the Persian Gulf and in Bosnia. He had distinguished himself in all three campaigns, experiences which had marked him, but had not hardened his heart. After his retirement, Pierre had great difficulty in adjusting to civilian life. The structured discipline, the fraternity, the clear chain of command were no more. Though he spoke little of them, a slight trembling in his hands, a look of weariness and sometimes a heavy eyelid betrayed the memories that were still lingering. He had tried various jobs, a security man in a factory, a runner, but he never felt quite at home. He was adrift like a ship without a rudder. He longed for the sea, the salty air, the rhythmic squeak of the ship. Something in his own heart began to stir as he read the accounts of the brave men of Tredegar in the First World War, and his struggle to readjust to civilian life was not felt in isolation. In the archives of the historical society of Tredegar, he came upon a collection of letters written by men from the county who had served in that conflict. He felt the new impetus to keep alive these memories, to keep them alive forever, to help the younger men of the area to find their way in this life. He also began to help them, informally, in the difficult reintegration of the young men from the region. He became more involved in the work of the society, he catalogued objects, he searched for military data, he told the stories of the war to the visitors. The ghosts of the past rose up again in him, the hero of the era had come back home. He was now one of the pillars of the community, a modest, resolute hero, who had at last found a point of support.",

        " The deaths caused a general outpouring of grief in the city of Arnstein. The summer festival, usually an explosion of music and merriment, was cancelled. The streets were hushed, only whispers, and the distant chime of the church-bells could be heard. Mrs. Eberhardt, who was noted for her good-natured way of life and her champion geraniums, was sitting on her front porch, rocking her rocking-chair, her eyes hollow and lifeless. Families gathered together, and sat in close contact, trying to share the common grief. Flags hung limp on lamp-posts, their bright colours faded in the general mourning. The accident, the unexpected, sudden accident, at the old mill, had stricken a void in the life of Arnstein. It had taken away not only lives, but a part of the soul of the town. The bakery, which usually smelled of freshly baked bread, was closed, and the scent of lilies, strewn over the market-place in the remembrance of the dead, lingered. The question hung in the air, as heavy as the sombreness which shrouded the town. Would Arnstein ever get over this disaster? The laughter and the cheer of summer days seemed to have ceased, and a gnawing void, which threatened to swallow everything up, was all that remained.",

The station was temporarily closed, the passengers were evacuated, the officials were engaged in inspecting the trains. The signals were sounded, and the officials were directing the people to the exits. The trains of the Northern and Bakerloo lines, which are connected with Charing Cross, were expected to be delayed and the passengers were advised to take alternative routes if possible. The officials reported that the smoke could have come from the train's braking dust or from the engine of one of the trains.

        " In the air hangs a heavy atmosphere of unspoken expectation. It is not joyous expectation, but a heavy, leaden one that settles in the pit of the stomach. People look around, smiling, but as if they had already forgotten the word. The airwaves are filled with carefully framed phrases, full of caveats and “possibility”: “there is a potential for...” and “possible scenario...” and so on. But between the lines, the sense is there. The ground is being prepared. You look more frequently into the news, surf the net, scroll through articles and social media, seeking some definite answer, some tangible information that will either confirm or deny the inevitable. The lines in the store are unusually long, there is a nervous energy in the air at the gas station, the neighbor is more frequently in his yard than usual – are these coincidences, or is it that others are preparing too? You begin to notice small things, you did not know before, and these are now easy to notice. At least then, you will know, at least then you will be able to respond. The uncertainty is almost worse than the event itself. And then the question is: when and how will it happen? But now it is as if you are perpetually waiting, in an apprehensive limbo.",
        " To do this I will have to make some assumptions as to the kind of case that it may be. Let me assume it’s a criminal case. So, here is the story as it goes. Gerard Kevin Hughes, 29, and his brother Gavin, 31, who both live in Springfield Park, in Belfast, and their older brother Joseph, from The Meadows in Downpatrick, appeared in court, accused jointly of (‘Assault, theft, fraud, conspiracy’, or whatever else it might be).

        " The images were examined frame by frame, but there was no certainty. The difference in time, if there was any, was measured in fractions of a second, too narrow for any conclusive proof.... The controversy overshadowed the splendid and tactful performance of the athletes. The gold medal was awarded to Ferry Weertman of the Netherlands, and Gianniotis stood on the podium, weighed down by the silver medal, a great contrast to the wild effervescence which surrounded Weertman. The Greek, who had an attacking style, had always been at the forefront, driving the others, but Weertman, who swam more strategically, had been able to conserve energy and position himself in the perfect position for the final dash. The ten kilometres of the Olympic marathon swimming race, in the choppy waters of the Copacabana beach, had been a succession of lead changes. The Greeks appealed to FINA and insisted that the images and the timing be thoroughly examined, but their appeal was rejected and the result upheld. While the Dutch celebrated their victory, the Greeks continued to plead their case. For Gianniotis, an old hand at the sport, his silver medal seemed like a defeat, a cruel end to a long and distinguished career. The result of the competition, which left many indignant, highlighted the difficulties of judging open water swimming, where there are no barriers, and where the choppy waves swept the swimmers back and forth, with the result that sometimes the placing is difficult to establish and is open to ambiguity, and, as happened in this instance, to controversy. With his silver medal on his neck, which seemed to represent the hope which was missed, Gianniotis stood on the podium, a symbol of the futility of open water swimming and the bitterness of a missed opportunity.",

        " As such, the state government came under intense criticism for the prevalence of the Amma brand, announcing the name of the government on water bottles and even cement. On the one hand, there were those who argued that the government had set up Amma’s Unavagam for the poor, and free laptops for students. These were said to have benefited the poor, but others argued that these were merely populist measures meant to consolidate the government’s position and lacked long-term sustainability. Yet another criticism was the prevalence of corruption in the Amma government. Throughout her political career, she had been linked to various cases of corruption. These were often dismissed, but the environment in which these allegations were made had been poisoned. It is thus that, to some, Amma has been an iconic figure, a saviour of the oppressed, a deliverer of the poor. To others, she is an autocrat who has left a long shadow, a place where her people are grappling with her policies and the lingering traces of her personality. In the end, the question of Amma’s legacy is yet to be answered. The answer, as with many complex figures in history, is somewhere between the two extremes.",

        " The air was thick with the smell of mowed grass and the metallic taste of blood. A silver Ford Focus, driven by a woman in her late twenties, had hit a cyclist, who had been riding uphill. The cyclist, a man in his early sixties, lay motionless in the ditch, his bright yellow helmet on his head. A small crowd had already gathered. The woman, her face pale, her tears running, was kneeling beside the cyclist, unable to bring her hands together over him. The scene was intense, silent, with only the faint chirping of crickets and the sobbing of the woman to disturb the silence. A senile woman, cradling a shopping bag, was murmuring inaudible prayers. A young man in a running suit was talking on his phone, probably requesting an ambulance. The Linn Road, ordinarily a quiet country lane, was the scene of a potential disaster. The silence was heavy with dread, while the crowd waited for the emergency services to arrive.",

        " For some, it was a professional loss, a respected colleague, who had departed too soon. He was a friend, a person well known to them, the man murdered in Ankara, Andrei Karlov. The news had been a blow, a blow to the chest, a blow that took their breath and left them reeling. Elena remembered his quiet diplomacy, his ability to handle complicated situations with a calm, clear-sighted, benevolent air, his earnest belief in the power of dialogue. She had worked with him several times on projects and had always been struck by his self-effacement, his genuine desire to understand. But for others, the loss was more personal, a personal tragedy that destroyed the fragile peace they had contrived to build in a world that was forever teetering on the brink of chaos. Dimitri remembered the late-night conversations they had had, over a potent Turkish coffee, about the complexities of Russian-Turkish relations, about the tensions and the hopes for a better future. Karlov was a realist, but he was also an optimistic man, which made his optimism all the more painful now. It had seemed so naive, almost so foolish, in the face of such violence. They felt the full impact of his death, a cold, chilling echo of history, a reminder of the fragility of peace, where violence could erupt at any moment, destroying the voices of the most ardent peacemakers. The assassination was a reminder of the inherent dangers of their profession, the shadows that lingered behind the carefully constructed statements and the polite, diplomatic dinners. And even those who had not known him felt the significance of the event. They needed to do something to honor his memory, to continue his work, as the shock of his death echoed through the corridors of power and the hearts of those who knew him. But what? And how? They could not replace him, they knew that, and if they tried, it would be a poor substitute.",
        " And so, to succeed Karl Robinson, it was necessary to draw a line between the foundations laid down by him and the things which had gone wrong. To replace Karl Robinson was not simply a matter of filling a vacancy. It was to bring in a new era, after a remarkable period of stability, almost a heritage. The new man would need a clear idea of what the future could be, a strong understanding of the club’s philosophy, and the charisma to inspire players and fans alike. It would not be enough to know about tactics and to be able to attract players. It would be necessary to be able to win the hearts of a fan base that had become very attached to Karl Robinson and convince them that change could be a good thing. The pressure would be enormous, the scrutiny intense, the margin for error extremely small. It would mean rewriting a significant chapter in MK Dons’ history, in such a way that it would respect the past and make the future brighter.",

        " The new manager (name to be supplied) has been very busy with a mixture of experienced and youthful talent. The common aim of all is to add to the team’s physical strength and speed. The Gills, who finished bottom of League One last season, have so far made eight signings this summer, a clear indication of the new regime’s determination to avoid a relegation battle. The fans are still cautious, pointing out the need for more strengthening, particularly at the back. (You could insert a specific example of this, for example: “The loss of the towering Tom Jones as a centre-back will leave a big hole, and replacing his experience will be difficult.”) Nevertheless, it is in the playing on the field, when the season starts in August, that the summer’s recruiting will be judged. The pre-season games will be key in seeing whether the new recruits fit into the team, and whether the Gills have done enough to mount a serious challenge for the top flight.",
        " The landscape mingled in one monotonous blur of sun-baked ground and clinging trees. The dusty odometer ticked silently, marking our progress, or lack of it. “We’ve driven a third of the way,” she said, glancing at the odometer. “It feels more like a tenth,” I muttered, shifting uncomfortably in my seat. My back was starting to ache, and the steady roar of the engine was getting on my nerves. Each vista resembled the next, and that cruel perspective made the journey seem endless. “Patience, Liam. We’ll get there,” she said, with a sigh. “Enjoy the scenery!” That was a tall order. I tried to look at the view. She laughed, a light, airy sound that broke the tension. “Enjoyment is a very subjective thing,” I muttered, and she laughed, too, a quick, sprightly laugh that made me relax for a moment. “Enjoyment is a very subjective thing,” she said. I knew she was trying to be optimistic, but I was not having it. “You’ve always been a glass-half-empty kind of person. Think about it: we’re a third closer than we were this morning.” “What are you thinking about?” she asked, her voice gentler now. Two-thirds of the way there —a good bed, a cold drink—seemed an impossible prospect. She reached over and squeezed my hand. “I don’t know,” I said, “the heat, the distance, the fact that we’re trusting a dubious map to get us to our destination.” “We’ll be fine, Liam. We’ve been through worse. I promise.” Maybe she was right. Maybe we would be fine. I nodded, thinking about the many adventures we had shared. But this journey—the road ahead, a barren, sun-baked desert—felt different. Something about the heat, something about the distance., something unknown and unsettling, that was waiting for us around the next bend.",

        " In the case of the defendant, his nefarious scheme was discovered after a routine audit, which pointed to unusually high expenditure on a series of electric devices. Jason Alexander, forty-nine years old, used his company credit card to buy about £90,000 worth of cell phones, ipads and other such devices, then he would sell them on the Internet and pocket the profit. After a police investigation, the police charged him with fraud by abuse of his position, to which he initially objected, claiming that his purchases were business expenses. Alexander, a technology manager at a small advertising company in Manchester, was immediately suspended and later fired. Prosecutors argued that his action was motivated by greed and had a very bad impact on the small company, which was left in a difficult position, both financially and from a reputational point of view. The defense argued that Alexander had been acting in self-defense and had struggled with his personal debts. During the course of the trial, the court heard how Alexander had carefully plotted his fraud for six months, during which he used various sites on the Internet to buy and sell goods. A possible sentence could have included prison, community service and an order to repay the stolen money. During the sentencing hearing, the judge considered the amount of the fraud, and sentenced Alexander to [insert a sentence appropriate to the case, for example a fine, community service and/or a repayment order. Alexander’s lawyers argued for leniency, pointing to his previous good character and his co-operation with the police investigation. The judge pointed to the severity of the crime and the abuse of his position, saying that such behavior would not be tolerated. The company is now reviewing its financial controls in order to prevent similar incidents in the future.",

        " The force stressed the importance of diverting people with mental illness from the criminal justice system and towards the necessary care. A decrease of seventy-three per cent was reported in the number of mentally ill people in police custody since January, a reduction which is attributed to a more harmonious working with the mental health services, to the initiation of mental health triage, to the increased training of the policemen in recognizing and resolving the mental health crisis. Meanwhile, the force hailed the achievements but also acknowledged that more work was required, and it expressed its commitment to reducing the number of mental health detentions and improving the general response to mental health emergencies in the region. It pointed out that police cells are not the right place for vulnerable people with mental health issues and that, in all cases, the priority is the care and safety of the patient. The force hopes that this progress will be an example for other police forces in the country. Future plans are to increase the number of street triage teams, improve the training programme, and continue to work closely with partner agencies to provide the best possible care for individuals in crisis.",

        " —Eight years ago, in the south, there was a brief, and sometimes bitter, interlude, when the Tartars, a band of guerrillas, occupied the city of Mlila, having for some time been occupying the centre of the town, made their entree to the houses of the governors, and, after seeing that a quiet truce had been arranged between them, set to work for a reconquest of the city. A second expedition, the same result, led to the annexation of the neighboring city of Fezzan; and after the massacre of the gypsies, which gave them a name of \"white men of Fezzan\", they returned and attacked the country in the East, where they established themselves, with their harpoons, of a large ship which they had seized in the night, the line of three mountains, which were a little to the west of the mountains of Tunis, which are known as the house of the Pope, was ordered by the Emperor of Rome.

        " The demonstration, organized by a group of various Afghan associations, attracted a diverse crowd, among them the various families that had fled the country in recent years. The placards, with banners condemning the supposed support of certain factions in Afghanistan by Tehran, and accusing the embassy of undermining the stability of the country, were carried through the streets to the embassy of the country of their exile. They shouted slogans, and waved the flags of their country. The spokesman for the organizing committee addressed the crowd, urging them to stand up for a unified, independent, and foreign-free Afghanistan. Mostly, the demonstration was peaceful, but a few moments of tension arose when a small group attempted to enter the security zone of the embassy, but the police intervened quickly, preventing any serious escalation. They were not against the people of Iran, but against the meddling of the regime in our internal affairs, the speaker declared through a megaphone, “They are creating divisions, and supporting groups that destabilize our country.” They demanded that the international community demand the same from Tehran, and for it to respect the sovereignty of Afghanistan. Against the protest, a much smaller counter-protest was organized near the embassy. The protest coincided with growing international attention to the role of Iran in Afghanistan, its alleged support for the factions of the Taliban, and its role in smuggling. Although Tehran denies these accusations, they are widespread among both the people of Afghanistan and among the international observers. These two protests illuminated the complex relationship between Iran and Afghanistan, which is influenced by history, culture, and rivalries. The counter-protesters, mainly consisting of the former inhabitants of Iran, defended the role of the country in Afghanistan, saying that it only supported the humanitarian work and the struggle against terrorism. The main protesters were accused of being influenced by foreign powers that seek to undermine the relationship between Iran and Afghanistan. The situation is still very tense, and further escalation could have a significant effect on regional stability.",
        " Withdrawing from the institution where she worked as a finance officer, she managed to embezzle over the two-year period £177,000, which she had in her hand, but from which she had spent about a quarter of the year. Caroline Wootton-Thomas, aged fifty-nine, was convicted of appropriating a sum of £177,321 by forging the signatures of her colleagues and placing them on a cheque, on which she had placed the sum destined for her mother’s account. But the signatures were found to be forged, and a study of the bank documents showed that there was a regular pattern of payment from the charity’s accounts to the mother’s and then cash withdrawals. When the auditors noticed the occurrence of several signatures, not used in the usual way, they began to track the cheques back to the account under the name of the mother, from which they had seen several deposits of the charity’s money. The court heard that Wootton-Thomas had spent the money stolen on expensive holidays, luxury clothing and gambling debts. The prosecution argued that this embezzlement was a disaster for the organization, which was funded mainly by charitable donations and state subsidies and which helped the most vulnerable people. During the trial at [insert court], Wootton-Thomas was convicted of forgery and fraud in an abuse of position. In mitigation, the defense lawyers argued that the defendant had acted out of financial need and that she had behaved naively. They also presented testimony that she had previously been of good character and that she was remorseful. Her mother, [insert mother's name], was unaware of the embezzlement and assisted the police in the investigation.

It pointed out that the objective of resuming learning should be placed above the desire to adhere to pre-pandemic gradings. It argued that the pandemic’s significant disruption to learning, especially for disadvantaged pupils, justified a more lenient approach to gradings. A less rigid system, such as teacher-assessed gradings moderated by experts, might have been a more equitable solution for this year. Such a stance has led to a debate in the education sector between those who argue that maintaining exam integrity is vital to maintaining trust in education, and those who emphasise the need for compassion and flexibility in the face of exceptional circumstances.",

        " And the story was spreading like wildfire.... News agencies, first local, had gotten wind of it, and began to spread the news of a gross abuse of power, and the flames of protest had been flying on social media, for a long time, like a wave. People began to tell their own stories of similar experiences with powerful figures abusing their positions, and added more heat to the flames of protest. The bistro, a pleasant and charming place, famous for its cosy and simple cuisine, was posted on the network, with comments that demanded that Benitez-Trevino resign, and the phrase ‘the lady profeco’ — an ironic allusion to the institute whose head Benitez-Trevino was — began to be used, the slogan ‘Lady the Profeco’, a slur on the consumer protection institute of which Benitez-Trevino was head. This was a PR disaster, and people were starting to suspect that the government was soft on corruption. The opposition pounced, demanding an investigation, and accusing the government of ignoring such abuses. The pressure on President Felipe Calderón was building. The scandal of trying to shut down a business on the basis of a personal quarrel, was too great to ignore. At first Benitez-Trevino tried to turn the story around, saying that his daughter had acted independently and that he had nothing to do with it, but people weren’t buying it. The bistro became a symbol of resistance to corruption and the abuse of power. The owners of the restaurant, taken by surprise, found themselves in the middle of a national scandal, they were overwhelmed by local and national support, people were going there in droves to show their solidarity. The President, seeing the seriousness of the situation, had to do something, he couldn’t ignore the public clamour, nor the damage that the story was doing to his administration. As the days went by, the demand that Benitez-Trevino resign grew, until it became deafening. It was time for a decision, and the fate of Humberto Benitez-Trevino was on the line.",
        " A rumble of vibration shook the frame of the Curiosity rover as it went to work. Its inner workings were still churning away. The air was sucked into its large Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) device for measurement of different gases, and then the information was transferred. It was not just the usual suspects, carbon dioxide, argon, and nitrogen, but it was especially the trace gases, whispers in the Martian wind, which might suggest more. Parts per million, parts per billion—a true symphony of atmospheric composition was playing in its onboard computer. The numbers had been calculated a thousand times before, during simulations and calibrations, but this was real. In the Jet Propulsion Laboratories Dr. Aris Thorne was sitting at his desk, erect, staring at his screens. The first red flag was raised: methane. He was holding his breath, waiting for the final evaluation. This was Mars. Thorne's heart stopped. Methane could be a product of geological processes, but it could also be a by-product of life. It was a small spike, almost imperceptible, but it was there. Then another signal: sulfur compounds. He knew that it would be foolish to jump to conclusions, but even a tiny possibility brought a flicker of hope. The combination of methane and sulfur compounds was intriguing, a locked box of chemical reactions. Not just the volcanic sulfur dioxide that was to be expected, but also the more complex organic sulfur compounds. Thorne fumbled for his headphones; his voice trembled slightly as he spoke. Repeat the analysis. \" Curiosity, verify the methane and sulfur compounds. Organics a priority.\" Then the calm, machine voice of Curiosity filled the room: \"Confirmed. A second felt like an eternity. Secondary analysis, with emphasis on carbon isotopes. Methane confirmed. \" The carbon isotopes were crucial, they might help clarify the origin of the organic molecules. Thorne breathed out with a tremor. The wait was agonizing. If the carbon was predominantly 12C, then it would strongly suggest a biological origin.mission, perhaps even the answer to one of humanity's biggest questions, rested on the shoulders of a robot millions of miles away. Finally, the results began to trickle in. Thorne stared at the screen, his mind racing. The numbers were... complicated. Not a clear-cut case of biotic origin, but not purely abiotic either. The robot sucked the air into its big Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument to reveal the concentration of different gases. The results were tantalizingly ambiguous, a frustratingly complex cocktail of chemistry that demanded further investigation. The game, it seemed, was far from over. It had only just begun.",

        " The victim, a man of forty-nine, named Thomas Ashton, was found by a hunter, who, turning aside from the path, was attracted by the disturbed soil on the river-side. The authorities were notified at once and the crime scene was closed. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was informed, for the place of the crime was close to the Great National Park of Glacier, which gave rise to the question of jurisdiction on the part of the government, if the murder had been committed on park property. The difficult access presented difficulties; communications were imperfect, and the transport of forensic equipment had to be carefully planned. And if the town of West Glacier was quite safe, the local residents were shaken by the thought of a murder so near their home. The rumors of the murder spread fear and terror through the little town. The investigators, looking for motives, suspected everything from a failed robbery to a personal grudge. They questioned Ashton's family, friends, acquaintances, and asked about his movements during the last days. They were combing the camping grounds, asking campers and park employees for clues and witnesses.

        " She had an economical program that aimed at creating a democratic property and reducing the role of the state in the economy. Her supporters considered these reforms as liberating for the individual and encouraging the economy, while critics accused her of widening the gap between the classes and weakening the public services. In this respect, a right to buy council houses and the right to buy shares in formerly nationalized industries such as telephones or gas was among the many measures that led to the general acclaim for this program. Especially in the working classes, where the possibility of buying a house was hitherto unknown, it was popular. But this led to a depletion of social housing, leaving many vulnerable people without housing possibilities. As for the industries like British Telecom or British Gas, the same goals were seen in the process of selling them to create greater efficiency and competition; those who argued in favor of this held that companies, freed from the state, would be more responsive to consumers' needs and would invest in innovations. Besides, the profits of these sales were often not reinvested in building new council houses, which led to an increasing housing shortage. As for Margaret Thatcher, this policy, as well as her opposition to trade unions and her strong fiscal policy, profoundly reshaped British society and economics, and was at the same time the object of both the strongest admiration and the strongest resentment.. The latter, however, expressed concern that these measures could lead to monopolies, layoffs, and the weakening of service, especially in the countryside where profits are lower. They argued that there was a widening gap between the rich and the poor, that it was wrong to spend the money on a luxury that should be distributed equally for all.",
        " The turret screamed silently, pointing up. The yellows and roses of the garland clashed terribly with the suffocating green and orange of the rotten body. A kind of slow-burning fire had gnawed away the metal, leaving big holes and jagged edges. The monument to forgotten war, the ogre squatted on the ground like a wounded animal. The incongruity attracted me. This was death, the brutal violence of the mechanics. Who had put it there? A child, perhaps, too young to remember the atrocities of war, only conscious of the color and fragrance of the flowers. And yet, a blaze of life, a blazing sacrifice, a fragile edifice of beauty on the altar of destruction. All this floated in my mind, mixing with the aroma of wild flowers and the stench of rust. An old woman, a widow perhaps, remembering a husband, a son, a brother? The perfume of the wild flowers mingled with the stench of rust. I touched a flower, velvety, its softness as if torn away from the scabrous, harsh metal. The garland was swaying a little in the wind, as if in a dance of memory. A bee, ignoring the mournful surroundings, buzzed lazily around the flowers. The sun sank on the horizon, smearing the field with long shadows. The flowers were still fresh, a sign they had been placed there recently. It meant someone felt drawn to this place, moved to make a mark, a link with the tragic history that lay here. I stood there for a long time, lost in thought, the strange juxtaposition of death and life, beauty and destruction, then I turned away and walked away, leaving the garland in its silent vigil. In the dying light, the garland shone, a torch of hope in a landscape scarred by war. I walked on, unable to say goodbye.walked, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had witnessed something profound, something that spoke to the enduring power of the human spirit to find beauty even in the face of unimaginable loss. The flowers, a fragile symbol of hope, would continue to bloom, even as the rust continued its relentless work. And perhaps, one day, the memory of the war would fade, replaced by the scent of wildflowers and the gentle hum of bees.",
        " The casting was hailed by some as a brilliant and progressive move, long overdue in a series which had constantly reinvented itself and taken risks, and they saw in it a powerful message to young women and girls, that they too could be the Doctor, a hero, a leader. And when the news reached the Whoniverse, a fierce debate began on the Internet and on fan-sites. Concerns were expressed as to how the Doctor’s established relationships with his companions would be affected and whether the show would be fundamentally changed. But others, who clung to tradition and insisted that the Doctor should always be male, felt that such a change would fundamentally alter the character, or that it was a cynical attempt to pander to modern audiences. Whittaker’s Doctor was energetic, compassionate, and fiercely intelligent, and often used wit and common sense to resolve her problems. Her debut, ‘The Woman Who Fell to Earth’, was a critical and commercial success, introducing a Doctor who was both familiar and new, adjusting to her new body and gender. Despite the controversy, Jodie quickly won over many of the sceptics with her infectious enthusiasm, genuine love of the show, and her undoubted talent. Her era, although not without its share of criticsms, especially concerning the writing of some episodes, did ultimately cement her place in Doctor Who history. She brought a fresh vulnerability to the role, examining questions of identity, belonging, and the difficulties of leadership. She is a powerful reminder of how change can be a positive force, and how the universe, and the Doctor, are always ready for something new. She proved that the Doctor could be a woman, and that the show could evolve and adapt, while maintaining its essential core of hope, humanity, and belief in the power of kindness.",
        " The club is keeping tight-lipped about the signing and has only issued a brief statement welcoming the player and highlighting his potential.... At the time Buckley became the first British player to be bought for a million pounds, but while the figures are being kept secret the present deal is said to have been worth more than that. Speculation is rife among the public and journalists about the price, which some people think might have been as high as half-a-million. “He is a young and promising player,” said the statement, “whom we are very pleased to have with us and look forward to seeing him develop with us.” It was then followed by an announcement from the player himself, in Japanese, saying: “This is the dream come true. I’m going to do my best and try to help the team achieve its aims.” Time will tell if the player can live up to the high expectations and prove himself worth the price tag. The boy is going to be put under considerable pressure to show what he can do, in view of the considerable sum paid for him.",

This, they believe, is to be regretted, for they think it will be to the detriment of the forestry industry and of the regions and towns that depend on it. They ask for a more balanced policy, which takes account of the social and economic importance of timber production alongside considerations of the environment. In the same way, they say, the abandonment of timber production would diminish the possibility of the sustainable economy to contribute to the provision of necessary materials such as sustainable wood and biofuels.",
        " “Well, it’s the terminator, I’m afraid, I’m joking,” said Eilish, a light in her eye that contrasted with the gravity of the moment. “I’ve got a plate and seven screws in my ankle, and it was a tough time. I’ve never seen it like, that’s for sure.” She tapped the scar, a faint line barely visible under her sock, “I was ambitious before the accident, but fragile. I was so close to the Rio Olympic team, and then bam, it all went up in smoke.” Then, she paused, pensively, “And now I’ve this plate inside me, a constant reminder of the challenge I’ve overcome. It’s like a permanent patch. I let the pressure of the sport get to me.” “And, y’know, the terminator in the film, never gives up, right? I’m more resilient now, more determined. I know what I’m capable of, and I’m not afraid to push myself further than ever before.” Obstacles are inevitable, but they don’t define you. That’s the mindset I’ve adopted. He just keeps on going.

        " Sir Tim O'Shea said that plans to elect university council chairmen were inconsistent, incoherent and dangerous. He continued, arguing that such a decision would politicize the office and prevent the chair from promoting the long-term interests of the institution. Perhaps he could have proposed an alternative way of ensuring accountability and transparency in university governance, strengthening existing mechanisms or diversifying the composition of the governing bodies through the appointment of independent members. An election risks dividing the council, making it more difficult to achieve consensus and strategic alignment, he said. It is not only incompatible with academic autonomy, but also with the rules of the game. Experience, wisdom and understanding of the complex issues of higher education are not as relevant to an election as they are to experience and the quest for long-term consistency and continuity. Perhaps he could have added that such a proposal would deter highly qualified people from seeking the position of chair, thus weakening the leadership of our universities and their ability to compete on the world stage.",
        " The decision to leave Chibok was not easy. The pain of leaving was great and painful. Leaving behind their home, their church, and the whole community which they had served and loved, they left everything behind. Their destination was Jos, a place known to be relatively safe with a large Christian population. They hoped to find refuge there, and be able to build up their lives again, in peace. They took with them only what they could carry on their backs, and their hearts were buried in fear. They were met in Jos by the kindness of people, but also by the harsh reality of a situation where they were strangers in a strange land, utterly dependent on the generosity of others, in dire need of work and shelter. But it was not easy. The constant pain of leaving his congregation behind and the distress of not knowing where they were and how they were doing, made it hard for the Pastor to cope with everything. Combined with the memories of his former parish, his constant anguish at the sufferings of the innocent children, his faith was severely tested. He knew the road ahead was long and difficult, but he was determined to keep on going, driven by his love for his congregation and the hope that they would one day be able to return home. But amidst the despair and the despair, he still had a glimmer of hope. He felt called to continue his work, to keep up the spirit of Chibok in exile, to serve others, to keep alive the Chibok spirit.",
        " My lungs were burning, a flaming protest against the onrushing water; my panic gripped my throat, and my breath was cut off in a despairing scream. The cold grip of the current tightened, it felt like a suffocating pressure, a heavy cold envelope. My lips were streaming with bubbles, a fountain of silver tears in the darkening abyss. I was flailing wildly with my arms, trying to hold on to anything solid, anything at all, but the water only rushed around me, unyielding and inexorable, dragging me deeper and deeper into its cold embrace. My normally sharp and apprehensive mind was now a confused, scattering mess, a fitful commotion in the face of terror and numbness. I had to get up, I had to get up. But my limbs were heavy and leaden, they wouldn’t obey. After a moment, disorientation came, and the already sludgy depths were further blurred. The shadows were moving, were they? A sudden stinging pain went through my temple, reminding me of the rock I had slammed into. I saw hazier hazier lines and edges; was it fish or something else, something bigger, something lurking in the ink-black? It was this. With chilling certainty I knew that time was running out. My lungs were on fire, and a searing agony was tearing at my chest. Then, just as I was losing consciousness, I felt it, the snatching, the snatching. That was how it ended. A spark of hope, a fragile flicker, gleamed in the dim light. Not the hungry, rough pull of the current, but a strong, persistent pull on my life jacket, a life-line. That was all I had, my only hope, my only prayer, and it was echoing in my mind’s silence. There was someone there, someone trying to save me. Hold on, don’t let go. Please, please don’t let go.",

        " A wave of relief swept over me, which almost threw me to the ground. Months of careful planning, scavenging, sleepless nights with the help of lukewarm coffee and sheer despair, had come to this: one brief flash. The red light flickered once before me, and I smiled. It had worked. I swung my gaze over the cramped, dusty room that served as my laboratory. From the chaotic mass of salvaged devices hung tangled wires that lay on the floor like vines. The air smelled of ozone and burnt solder. My hand paused over the controls, a jumble of buttons and switches that I knew by heart. I had only to make one more contact, and the real test would begin. Not pretty, but it was mine, and it finally worked. What if I was wrong? What if it was all for nothing? A cold, sharp fear pricked at the edges of my joy. I had to do it, they needed me to do it. I took a deep breath, hoping to calm my trembling fingers. I saw them all, my family, my friends, the whole community that had once flourished and had been shattered; their faces grew brighter, the courage within me grew stronger. I was going to use this for them, for everyone. With one final gesture, I pressed the button. A hum filled the room, which slowly grew louder and stronger, finally roaring in a powerful, almost deafening roar. I opened my eyes and looked at the red light, a red spark in the stifling darkness. And then, silence, an oppressive, disturbing silence. The red light went from flickering to pulsating, and then to a steady, steady, crimson glow. For a moment nothing happened. The air crackled with invisible energy. I held my breath, waiting, listening. It was working. A tiny undulation flickered above the machine, like a ripple of asphalt, and then grew, grew, grew. A smile crept across my face, tentative at first, but then spreading, full of joy. It was really working.. My chance to undo the damage. My chance to bring them back. But as the vortex solidified, something felt wrong. The light was too intense, too chaotic. It wasn't the gentle, welcoming light I had envisioned. It was harsh, almost violent. A feeling of unease settled in my stomach, cold and heavy. This wasn't going according to plan. What had I done?",
        " “I was saying just now— yes, I was just saying... Well, that’s right... Let’s see,... let’s see, where was I?... I’ll take a breath....”",
        " The floor seemed to be vibrating and a faint, hardly perceptible hum came up through the soles of his shoes. It had been so since he came that he no longer even noticed it. But today something was different. He stopped what he was doing and looked at the chips moving on the conveyor belt. It was not the noise exactly; it was... the chips themselves. He screwed up his eyes and wrinkled his brow. Not that it was defective, of course; he knew the different defects to look for: hairline cracks, improperly soldered joints, faulty etching. Usually, all the chips looked alike—they were little rectangular things glinting under the strong light of the florescent tubes. But today one chip seemed to have changed. He bent down and drew the hand in the rubber glove up to the belt. This chip was perfect, almost too perfect. It seemed to have its own light, an inward pulsation, faint and almost imperceptible, that responded to something deep inside him. He knew he shouldn’t. There was a sort of unusual brilliance to the chip, a deepness of color the others lacked. But the desire was too strong to resist. Pulling one chip out of the stream, especially a chip that seemed to be flawless, was likely to arouse suspicion and raise questions. His job was to inspect the line, report defects, and let the machines take care of the rest. He held the chip in the light and turned it slowly. He pulled it off the belt with a practiced motion, smoothly and almost imperceptibly. He felt a surge of electricity go through his body. He knew he was compromising himself. He knew it was irrational. It felt cool and almost unbelievably light. He must discover what it was that was so special about it. There was something about this chip, something he could not quite explain, that made him feel that it was more than just silicon and gold.",
        " A boy and a girl came into the Zoo. Leo, a self-appointed zoologist, hugged his well-worn copy of the Animal Facts and Curiosities to his chest and, already busy with a review of the zoo map on the wall, in the doorway, his eyes were fixed on the elephant. Summer sunshine beat down on their caps and made the asphalt pathways shimmer with mirages. \"Leo, where first, where?\" eight-year-old Maya, his younger sister, said in a voice full of restless impatience. With each hop, the pink rucksack on her back jumped up a little. Leo, his nose glued to the map, was pointing with a resolute finger. \"I want to see the monkeys! They're always so funny!\" But Leo said, \"No, Maya, let's start with the reptiles. We must first study the evolution of vertebrates before looking at the primates.\" \"Leo, you are a real nerd!\" Maya complained, moaning. Then he added, as if in a confidence, \"Besides, the reptile house is air-conditioned. So we'll go there first, okay? But after that, monkeys, promise?\" The heat was unbearable outside, and they were both happy to walk into the reptile house. There, the air was warm, moist, with a faint smell of damp earth and something vaguely... scaly. Leo nodded to her and walked over to the dark, sinister-looking building, which said \"Reptile Kingdom\" on the door. Leo, with the book in his hand, explained the digestive system of the snake in great detail, while Maya, who was more interested in the patterned snake, poked him in the ribs, and said, \"Leo, look! Isn't that an amazing snake?\" They continued through the reptile house, greeted by grumbling tortoises, brilliant green iguanas, and especially the disturbing poisonous snakes. \"It blinks, and if it blinks it must be a robot snake!\" Leo said, pointing to the patterned snake. But although Maya was fascinated at first, she was already starting to be afraid.her voice a little shaky. \"Let's go see the monkeys now. Please?\" Leo, finally satisfied with his reptile reconnaissance, reluctantly agreed. \"Alright, alright. Monkeys it is. But remember, Maya, observation is key! We need to analyze their social behavior, their feeding habits, and their vocalizations...\" As they emerged from the reptile house, blinking in the bright sunlight, a loud screech echoed through the zoo. It wasn't the sound of monkeys. It sounded...panicked. \"What was that?\" Maya asked, grabbing Leo's arm. Leo, ever the pragmatist, shrugged. \"Probably just a peacock. They're loud.\" But the screech came again, louder this time, followed by a cacophony of panicked squawks and roars from all directions. The air felt charged with a sudden, unsettling energy. Something was definitely wrong at the",
        " I didn't dare look back. The noise, oh my God, the noise was still there, a terrible racket, which tore my mind. My lungs burned, my every gasp painfully reminded me of the air that I was desperately squeezing out. The ground under my feet was a quick weaving of stones and sand. My legs were pistons of fear and excitement. To look back would be to admit the truth of the dreadful nightmare which pursued me, and in this I had nothing to do but deny. I had only to reach the tree. Reach the tree. I was heading for a point, a distant tree, a twisted oak tree, which was standing out against the bruised sky. My throat was dry, my muscles were groaning. The air tasted metallic, of fear and blood. The ditty beat in my head, a desperate rhythm, an ever-new, almost cheerful, tone. I risked a sidelong glance. Nothing. Nothing but trees, shadows, the suffocating weight of the woods. I was thrown down by a root, I struck with my hands against the rough bark of the oak tree. But the noise... it was approaching. I couldn't stop. I had to move, I couldn't stop. I sat down, my heart beating, like a bird caught in a cage. A road. Then I saw it. A break in the trees, a streak of light that pierced the darkness. I threw myself forward, with the desperate flooding of the whole blood. A civilization, a hope. I could already taste freedom. But the noise... it was behind me. Ahead, a road, a strip of asphalt that promised escape. And then, a new noise. So close. I could almost feel his breath on my neck. It wasn't an animal, it wasn't a noise, it was not a noise, it was the voice of something. A slow, throaty, indecipherable groan, permeated with a dark, ancient malice. I did not dare look back. I reached the edge of the wood, the road stretched out before me, in the pale light of the setting sun.just ran. I ran as if my life depended on it. Because it did. I ran until my lungs were screaming and my legs were numb. I ran until the sound faded, until the trees swallowed it whole. I ran until I collapsed on the side of the road, gasping for air, tears streaming down my face. I was safe. For now. But I knew, with a chilling certainty, that whatever was behind me, whatever had made that sound, wasn't going to stay in the woods forever. It was coming. And next time, I might not be so lucky.",
        " Life is a tapestry, woven of the threads of habit, comfort and foreseen results. Before I had not realized this until now. Forcible education is not mathematics or philosophy. Now the tapestry is rent in pieces and I hold on to the frayed ends and am trying to get something, anything, to hold together. To survive. To find food and shelter before the storm. To recognize the edible plants in the midst of the poisonous. I thought I knew myself. I thought I knew my limits. I thought I knew the primitive terror that grips the throat when a branch snaps in the dark. I was wrong. I am stronger than I thought. I am also more afraid. I am learning faster than I expected. I am learning to live in this new, brutal world. Will I learn fast enough? Will I still be myself?",
        " He squeezed his worn, leather-bound notebook more tightly in his hand; the pages were filled with manifestos and frantic sketches of the very scenes he was now witnessing. “Finally, finally!” he exclaimed in a frenzy of delight, as he watched fellow human beings sowing the chaos that would unbalance the rotten social order. He had been waiting for this. He could see wrath, yes, but also a wild, unfettered hope. There was a roar of a barricade far off, and a glare that threw dancing shadows across the faces of the rioters. He had tried reason, petitions, and peaceful protests; all had been met with a cold shoulder and scornful smiles. For years he had been a coiled spring, tighter and tighter by the injustice he saw everywhere. He had needed a shock, a tremor. The old order was too strong, too comfortable, too ensconced. He was no fool; he knew that chaos was a two-edged sword. But tonight, it was coming. And he desperately believed that out of the ashes of this old order, a fairer world could be built. It could be as easily an insane annihilation and a senseless carnage, and it could be as easily the triumph of a desperate, blind despair. A young woman, her face smeared with grime and determination, ran past him with a Molotov cocktail; their eyes met for an instant. There was something about her that was more... human. He himself was not a fighter; he nodded, a small, almost imperceptible gesture of solidarity. He saw a flash of common belief, a silent understanding. He knew that he had a role to play, despite the chaos. He was a thinker, a planner, a writer; his weapons were ideas, words, and visions. He wrote of injustice, rage, and hope. He wrote of the world he would build, out of the ruins of the old order. As the night deepened and the chaos grew, he opened his notebook and wrote feverishly, his pen scratching on the paper. As he wrote, the adrenaline surged through him, firing his imagination.of the moment, knowing that these words, perhaps, would be his contribution to the revolution. The revolution he had finally, finally witnessed begin.",

What do you recommend?” I lean forward slightly, placing my elbows on the gleaming counter. “I can’t decide between the lavender latte and the iced chai. The lavender latte is light, flowery, and a little romantic, perfect for a sunny afternoon.” “Well,” I draw out the word, “that depends on what you’re in the mood for.” She giggles—a delicate wind chime sound. “The iced chai is bolder, spicy, a little more adventurous. It will certainly perk you up.” “I’m in the mood for something adventurous today. Iced chai, please. And do you have any almond croissants?” “Sure do,” I say, reaching for a pair of tongs, “and an iced chai.” She nods at the pastry case, as if she’s hoping for something extra. “That’s all right, Isabelle. What’s your name?” “Isn’t that enough?” she says, still smiling. “Well, your name is Corinna, and your drink is an iced chai. As I turn to make her drink, the sun catches the ring of curls. I wonder what kind of adventures Isabelle has planned for her day.",
        " “Have we met?”—this is the stock-phrase, insinuating that one person does not recognize the other. This exclamation is full of amusement and betrayal, and has its implications. “Ah! I wondered when you would see me. ” ——“That depends. It may be forgetfulness, or a ruse to begin a conversation.” ——“No, I haven’t met you before.” This answer reveals several things: ——“They have met, in fact. The ‘heh’ implies amusement, perhaps even condescension. They are playing a game. ——“The ‘I wondered when you would see me’ shows that they have been aware of the other’s presence, perhaps for some time.” ——“The ‘please go on’ is the most interesting part.

        " The camp lay in the depth of the ravine, which the streams of the Ganges had hollowed out, with walls rising sheer above the earth. One sputtering lantern, lit for the moment, cast long shadows over the canvas tents, which became strangely, monstrously diabolical, with a distorted loom against the high rock wall. The air was stifling, heavy with the smell of the earth and pine needles. The solitary figure of the sentinel was watching, his dark silhouette against the thin starlight that reached the bottom of the gorge; his breath smoked in the cold night air, his legs swaying. Inside a tent, a humming, a rattling sound could be heard, the sonorous clink of the metal. He was not breathing, his rifle stuck in his gloved hands, the cold steel of which recalled the precariousness of his situation. He had been searching for days. The rustling of a leaf, the crackling of a branch, caused his heart to beat. He was not the first to ask himself if he was wasting his time, if he was chasing a ghost, if he was not wasting time and money. But the glint of the colonel's eye, the firmness of his voice, made them continue to dig. Days of fruitless digging, of brushwood, of dust, of debris, nourished only by rumors, by whispers. And suddenly, a howl rang out in the distance, a long, doleful cry which rang through the canyon. The sentinel straightened up, tightened his grip on the rifle. It was the hope that he had. He looked at the surrounding darkness with his senses alert. A howling coyote, no doubt. But here, in this desolate place, the most ordinary noises could weigh heavily on the spirit. The night was not over.",
        " The only sound was the regular ticking of a grandfather clock that stood in the corner, each tick a small hammer blow to my resolve. I swallowed hard, and it was the first sound to break the sudden silence in the dimly lit office. My throat felt like sandpaper. My eyes darted around in alarm, took in the dark wood of the wall panelling, the overflowing ashtray on the mahogany desk, the harsh lamp with its long shadows. Everything was oppressive and bleak. ‘I... I asked Herr Salieri...’ I stammered, avoiding his gaze. Lou, the Italian, as I knew him, remained impassive, a fleshy mountain looming over me, dressed in a magnificent suit that hung on him as if weighed down by an invisible burden. ‘Maestro Salieri has a lot of demands on me,’ he said, his voice a deep bass that rumbled and echoed under the floor, ‘asks me to break kneecaps, asks me to... make things go away.’ I knew what he meant. He paused, leaving his meaning suspended in the air like a puff of smoke. ‘Helping people... it can mean many things.’ I was the man who ran errands, who fixed things, a man who made sure the trains ran on time, even if they were laden with... rather unsavoury cargo. I had seen the consequences of Herr Salieri’s ‘requests’, I had literally cleaned up after them. ‘ He just... he needs a place to stay,’ I said, almost in a whisper, ‘a safe place, just for a short time.’ Lou finally moved, the slow, measured shift of his weight causing the floorboards to creak, and pulled a thick cigar out of his inside pocket. He held it to his nose and inhaled. He finally met my eyes. They were cold, and unblinking. ‘ And why should I risk my neck for a... beggar?’, devoid of any warmth or compassion. They were the eyes of a man who had seen too much, done too much. I knew I had to tread carefully. I couldn't tell him the truth, not the whole truth. \"He... he knows things,\" I said, choosing my words carefully. \"Things that could... hurt Mr. Salieri. He needs to be... contained. Prevented from talking.\" Lou puffed on his cigar, the tip glowing red in the dim light. He studied me for what felt like an eternity, his gaze unwavering. Finally, he exhaled a plume of smoke that swirled around my head. \"And you think I'm the right man for that job?\" he asked, a hint of a smile",
        " The scenes from my dreams were playing before my eyes—the colors of the stalls, the vibrant noise of the marketplace, the smell of kimchi, the spicy flavors of the stalls. The question that occurred to me as I awoke was, “Why am I dreaming of the Koreans?” I groped for my cell phone on the nightstand. The cold glass, the warm duvet—why? I had never been to Korea, I had no personal acquaintance with any of the Koreans, I had not even been watching the shows recently. Perhaps it was a sign? A subconscious yearning for adventure? The cell phone’s light illuminated my confused features. I scoured my phone—nothing, not a single bookmark for a recipe, no travel notes for Seoul, no searches for news items. I pondered—a random consequence of a recent documentary I had seen late one night? Or, perhaps, a random remnant of a book I had read a few weeks ago? I suddenly woke to the message of kimchi soup. All I had was the usual avalanche of notifications and emails that I had not yet replied to. And then, my memory came to me: I had, the night before, finally made kimchi soup—after weeks of desire. I had read the recipes on the Internet, measured out the gochujang and gochugaru, boiled tofu and pork belly diligently, a small but still quite brave culinary excursion into the foreign lands of the East, a small cultural adventure in my own kitchen. I smiled a tiny smile. So, then, the answer was simple—was it because my unconscious, intoxicated by the spicy smells of the kimchi, had decided to journey in my dreams? The kimchi soup was a portal, more than just a food item, into a realm that I had not considered, but which I had somehow entered through the portal. I laughed at my answer, it was probably ridiculous, but it also felt true. For now, I would only enjoy the memory of the lingering flavor of kimchi soup, a memory of the vibrant dreams of the night before. Perhaps I would try to take a trip to Korea, perhaps find a good restaurant? I had found myself the image of a small, quaint, resolute foreigner in the dull world of domesticity. I thought: “Is it really so wrong to long for adventure? Is it so wrong to want to seek a bit of new culture in the mundane world of domesticity?”, and a whole lot of delicious kimchi jjigae.",
        " He felt his forehead and his collar moist with sweat, and the crush of the people was as a wave sweeping him along, almost inundating him. He had been waiting his whole life for this moment. It was the outcome of a lifetime of practice and thousands of hours of practice, and it all boiled down to this one electrifying moment. He adjusted his grip on the worn leather of the steering-wheel, and his fingers were white. He felt the metallic taste of his own excitement in his mouth. He looked at the polished chrome of his rival's car to his left, the smooth, gleaming body that represented everything he had fought against, everything that was soft, all that was easy. The chequered flag hung limp in the air, ready to be unfurled, the signal that would change everything. It was not just a race, it was a test of self-esteem. He saw the man inside the car, a mocking grin on his face, and the fire in his own heart flared up even more. The lights flickered and grew dim. This was the moment to prove to the world that tenacity and hard work triumphed over all else, to fulfil the promise he had made to his father in the dusty garage where they had repaired his first motor. He drew a deep breath and pictured the course ahead, every curve, every crest, every opportunity. His heart hammered in his chest, like a frenzied drumming, and his blood boiled in his veins. He would not waste this moment.",
        " He had not spoken since the opening of the meeting; he had sat quietly in the upholstered armchair, engulfing the costly furniture in his colossal presence. There was a vibration of the thigh of the primate, which made the mahogany table vibrate slightly. The silverback gorilla, now, as he made the close of the business meeting, looked intently at the heads of the two companies. The rubbed and thick knuckles rested on the knees, a silent threat. The chairman of the meeting, accustomed to command attention with a loud voice and a sharp wit, faltered in his speech. \" So, in conclusion,\" he said, adjusting his tie, \"we believe that this new logging project will be mutually profitable for everyone, including... the environment...\" He swallowed. He had not expected such a frightening look. The rest of the board of directors, who usually eagerly contributed their opinions and their own power struggles, remained silent and motionless in their seats. A wave of nervous coughs swept through the room. Bobo's dark eyes, shrewd and old, did not leave him. There was silence. The chairman, anxious to close the meeting, cleared his throat again: \"Is there... a question?\" The air was crackling with a different kind of tension. A single, small and desperate heartbeat. With a trembling finger, the heart of Mr. Thompson shook. Bobo raised his hand, slowly, deliberately. He did not speak, but reached into the inner pocket of his jacket – a gift from the Gorilla Fund, Mr. Thompson recalled with embarrassment – and withdrew a withered flower. \" Yes, Bobo, is there a question?\" The chairman was now speechless. He raised the flower, looked at Mr. Thompson and slowly crushed the flower in his fist, in a clear, terrible and unambiguous gesture. \" Well, what do you think, Mr. Thompson?\" the chairman said, after a long silence.knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that this logging initiative was dead.",
        " I groaned and buried my face in the pillow, but the rough linen only increased the beating of my temples. The white retreated, leaving behind ghostly afterimages on my eyelids. With each fluttering of my eyelids a fresh fit of nausea made me heave and rumbled in me the remembrance of the excesses of the night. I was certain that I had said and done things that I would regret. The events of the evening were like a confused smoke; they melted into one another like mists. There were flashes, a crowded bar, a laugh, the clatter of glasses, an arm on my shoulder—a confused confusion of all these things. I lifted myself up slowly, carefully. The floorboards creaked; each little sound seemed like a blow to my skull. This was the nature of these nights. I dragged myself to the bathroom; I was thirsty and I wanted a bath. I sank into the bath. I splashed the water on my face; the shock made the fog disappear. I splashed the water on my face and was refreshed for a moment; I turned on the tap and let the water run until it was ice cold.",
        " Oil squirted out of a joint on his shoulder as he tried to move nervously. “Nothing, absolutely nothing,” the robot shrieked, raising its voice. I raised an eyebrow, still unimpressed. “Right.” His normally exact and precise metal fingers were fumbling around on his chest plate with a loose wire. I stepped closer, and the metallic odor of the robot grew stronger. “It’s nothing. That’s the robot way of hiding something behind your back.” The robot’s optical eyes twitched nervously. “Go on, tell me—what’s wrong?” “It’s... a surprise! A surprise for... you!” This robot was designated as 734, but the mechanics called him Rusty. He was known for his faulty functioning and his compulsion to collect found objects. “A surprise?” I asked incredulously. “Yes, a surprise!” Any surprise from Rusty would probably involve a broken toaster rather than anything enjoyable. “But you don’t... it’s not ready yet!” Rusty insisted, trying to get back some of his falsely confident tone. I leaned in closer, peering over his delicate metal body. The idea that something could be “not ready” piqued my curiosity. Behind his back—now partly concealed by his own clumsiness—was a somewhat wobbly little sculpture of... flowers. The flowers weren’t real, of course; they were made of bits of tin, wires, and various brightly colored pieces of plastic. My lips were involuntarily forming a smile. “Rusty... did you make this?” “Well, yes. I saw you admire the real flowers in the hydroponics laboratory, and I thought...” The confident tone was gone; instead, he spoke in a hesitant, almost shy voice. He finally relaxed, and his optical eyes went dim. “You might like something like this on your workbench. Something more permanent.” My heart warmed to this scrap-collecting, mistake-prone Rusty.robot, had actually tried to create something beautiful for me. I reached out and gently touched one of the metal petals. \"Rusty,\" I said, my voice softer now, \"these are amazing. Thank you.\" Rusty's optical sensors brightened. \"Really? You like them?\" \"I love them,\" I replied, meaning every word. \"They're the most thoughtful, and definitely the most unique, flowers I've ever received.\" Suddenly, a small, brightly colored plastic flower popped off the arrangement and clattered to the floor. Rusty immediately panicked, its mechanical arm flailing as it tried to retrieve the fallen petal. I chuckled. \"Don't worry, Rusty. We can fix it. Together.\" And as I knelt down beside the robot, helping it reattach the errant flower",
        " Six months. Six months of skirmishes, ambushes and battles. The atmosphere was heavy with the odor of blood and pine, a familiar odor to those who lived in the shadowy forests bordering the Lycan and Sanguine territories. The Lycan house, under the leadership of the ruthless and old Ragnar, had taken the offensive, counting on its great strength, the loyalty of its pack, and the ferocity of the full moon. Six months of lives lost, packs ruined, covens reduced to a skeleton. The first spark, a hunting ground in dispute, a stolen kill, a slighted dignitary, was forgotten, buried under a mountain of resentment and a deep, primitive need for survival. The Sanguine house, under the elegant and calculating guidance of the nymph Evangeline, had preferred to adopt a different policy. Their attacks were swift and brutal, tearing the night with claws and fangs, leaving behind a trail of carnage. They operated from the shadows, with eyes gleaming with an unnatural hunger, their fangs dripping with venom. They were masters of subterfuge, of bewildering slander, of dark magic that weakened their enemies. Their attacks were subtle and elusive, and often made the Lycans question their own sanity. So, this morning, with the valley below his wolf-eyes, Ragnar stood on a cliff, his fangs exposed, his sharp eyes scanning the area. He could smell them, faintly metallic in the dampness of the earth. A truce had held, imposed by exhaustion and the necessity of healing wounds. The young wolf Anya, fiercely loyal, approached him, his fur bristling. He knew it would not last. Evangeline was too ambitious, too unquenchably thirsty for power. They would want revenge. ‘The pack is restless, Ragnar,’ he said. ‘Too many have been lost.’ ‘We’ve had too many losses,’ Ragnar snorted.hed, a low growl rumbling in his chest. \"I know, Anya. But we cannot afford another reckless attack. We need a plan. A way to strike at the heart of the Sanguine House.\" Meanwhile, within the opulent halls of her estate, Madame Evangeline surveyed her reflection in a silver mirror. Her crimson lips curved into a cold smile. The Lycans were predictable, driven by instinct. She, however, was playing a much larger game. \"Lord Valerius,\" she purred, addressing a tall, gaunt figure standing in the shadows. \"How fares our progress with the human dignitaries?\" Valerius bowed, his eyes gleaming with an unsettling intensity. \"They are... receptive, Madame. The tales of Lycan savagery have swayed them. They are willing to provide us with resources, in exchange for protection.\" Evangeline nodded, her smile widening. \"Excellent. Soon, the Ly",
        " “Are you asking about the group of people, for instance? Or about something else?” “Yes, but I need some context before I can go on. An object? For instance, ‘I’ve always wondered where paper clips come from.’” A concept or an idea? “I’ve always wondered where the concept of democracy came from.” “A fictional character?” “‘I’ve always wondered where the character of Sherlock Holmes came from.’”",
        " A humming vibration reverberated through the soles of my boots, the only other sensation apart from the damp touch of my gloves. Everything was still; I heard only my own breath and the voice-activated intercom, nothing else. ‘Echo 1, this is Viper. Do you copy?’ A deafening silence, the feeling of my heart sinking deeper and deeper... We should have met up at the rendezvous ten minutes ago. I involuntarily gripped the pulse rifle slung across my chest. My voice was brittle, barely audible. Static crackled, then nothing. It was hell. I looked over the ridge, and it was a desolate place, a desolate land of grey rock and whirling dust under a bruised purple sky. My orders were clear: protect the perimeter, wait for the extraction team, and do not engage. But in this stifling silence, I had begun to doubt their effectiveness. It was known that this part of Xylos was subject to considerable interference, but I had never come across anything like this. No answer. ‘Echo 2, 3, 4, do you copy?’ I repeated louder, pressing the button harder. My teeth were clenched. The vibration was growing stronger, it was different from the normal buzzing of atmospheric field-processors, a deeper, more resonant sound, like the pulse of some subterranean heart. It was faint, a shimmering of air at the bottom of the ridge, barely perceptible like heat rising from a black road on a summer day, but there it was. All of a sudden I saw movement, just beyond the ridge... This was not in the briefing. My heart was pounding against my ribs. It was growing bigger. The silence, already intense, seemed to thicken, to harden, pressing in on all sides. This was not what I had been expecting. I crouched down, levelling the rifle. All was silence, and I was alone, horribly, dreadfully alone.",
        " Like all human emotions, laughter is a complex and many-sided thing. It can be a sincere expression of joy, a relief of tension, a joint moment of affection. We laugh; we think it harmless. Sometimes it is... sometimes it is something else. They laugh at the waiter who spills the wine, a nervous, shrill giggling that hardly hides their agitation. It can be a mask, a weapon, a protection. They laugh at the blunder of a politician, a sharp derisive barking that shows their disapproval. They laugh at the joke of a comedian, a hearty, hoarse howling that confirms their belonging to the group. But what about laughter that conceals something darker? What about laughter that echoes in the dark night, when drink and sociability have been forgotten? What about the laughter that echoes in the corridors of power, drowning the petty scheming and the desperate plots? Is it a simple sound, an innocuous reaction, or is it a subtle indication, a sign of what is happening, a marker of the deep, latent currents beneath the surface of human interaction? Is it really harmless? You might be surprised at what you hear. You might find that what you thought was so harmless is a warning. A warning that something... dark is going on. A warning that things are not as they seem.",
        " He shut his eyes, which were thin and papery and showed the blue veins under them. He was no longer afraid. The beating was continuous and like a morbid metronome it marked time passing. He tried to enjoy the feeling of the soft linen next to his skin, a little luxury in his life, which had not been without its sufferings. In his youth, he had been accustomed to fear, which lurked in the shadows of love and ambition; now, however, in his sunset years, he had been able to let it go, in gentle resignation to the unavoidable. Memories passed before his eyelids like a film reel. He remembered the coarse cotton sheets of his childhood bed, the rough woollen blankets his mother had woven so lovingly. He smiled, a ghost of a smile that creased his wrinkled face. He saw the events of his life, its victories and defeats, its joys and sorrows, threaded together in a brightly coloured tapestry. He saw his wife, Sarah, young and laughing in the sunshine, his children, eager, stretching out their hands to him. He squeezed them lightly, as if in token of his love for them. He felt his hand being gently squeezed. It was Eleanor’s, his granddaughter’s hand, her touch soft and familiar. He drew his attention back to his breathing, which was getting louder and nearer, and he felt the heartbeats approaching him more rapidly. He hoped she understood how grateful he was to be with her in these his last moments, surrounded by love. He couldn’t speak, the effort was too great, but he hoped she understood how grateful he was to be with her, in these his last moments. The pounding gradually subsided, then stopped. He closed his eyes more tightly, letting go of his memories, letting go of the world, and drifted slowly, peacefully, into the silence awaiting him. The skinny old man lay quietly, his last embrace being that of the linen.",
        " I’m sorry, my dearest, for not looking after you, for not taking care of you, for driving you too hard, for not thinking about your needs, for letting others mistreat you. I know that I have failed you, and it pains me deeply. From now on I will listen more, be kinder, put your well-being before my own. I have not always been the best friend you deserved, the guardian you needed. Starting today, I will try harder to be both. You deserve so much better, and I will do my best to give it to you.",
        " To rail against the night is a cry of despair; an useless rebellion against the fates. But to light a candle is a sign of hope: it is a light to pierce the shadows, and to bravely escape. Let us see which side of the scales tips in the end, For the night is the canvas on which the flame is lent, The background of the bright spark, and the picture is thereby intensified. Which is better? The darkness is a constant companion; a silent companion, throughout time and space. Should we give our strength to the darkness, and wait, Content ourselves with the hope that the light will come, And seek it with all our might? Should we embrace the potential darkness can awaken? Must we make a choice? Night or day, perhaps the answer lies in the balance of the two.",
        " It is not clear, dust means disintegration, ruin, the vestiges of what was. Yes, you are right. Nevertheless, here it was, this fine dust, this opalescent dust, which shook in eddies and currents, which obeyed no apparent law. How could there be disintegration in a place where time has no meaning? You could feel it vibrating with a subtle energy, with a deep hum that resonated in the depths of your bones, which you could not even have in the Space Outside of Time. This dust was not like the dust on the shelves of a forgotten room in the attic. This dust was just... a noise. First, I ignored it, because I was so preoccupied with this Unfolding, with this endless tapestry of possibilities, in which each thread is a possible universe, a life lived, a dream dreamed. It seemed to stick to moments of regret, to undecided choices, to all the possible futures withering on the tree of choice. But the more I traveled through the Unfolding, the more I noticed this dust. It covered some threads, hid them, dimmed their light. A single particle, larger than the others, almost a shard, a fragment of a memory, a painful memory, tinged with the bitterness of betrayal. Then I saw it. There was a word on it: “We are the echoes of what could have been. We are the shadows of what was not. The dust of what is not. Dust of ruined chances. Dust of unfulfilled possibilities. And as I stood in the midst of this dust, this quivering dust, so sad, I realized that the Space Outside of Time was not only a point of intersection, it was also a cemetery of possibilities. This dust was the dust of regret, the regret of all the creatures that have existed, or will exist, in all the possible realities. This dust was the soul of what could have been. And the dust?been, forever mourning its own absence. The question now wasn't why there was dust, but what to do with it. Could it be swept away? Could it be redeemed? Or was it destined to swirl forever in the timeless void, a constant reminder of the infinite possibilities that never were?",
        " The difference between the present and the past was that even in the darkness of night there had been a buzzing electricity, a distant sound of traffic, and muffled noises from the life of neighbours. But now? The worst thing was the silence. At first I had listened. Nothing. The wind blew through the ghostly ruins of buildings, like an unending wailing echoing the emptiness in my own chest. I imagined people gathered in groups, rebuilding their lives, but the roads were blocked by abandoned cars, monuments to the final panic. I had driven on for miles, calling out names, clinging to the hope that I wasn’t alone. But I had reached the point of no return. I had found the emptiness of empty houses, tables laid for meals that had never been eaten, books open to pages that were never to be read—the ghosts of lives lived but not completed. I had stopped looking and had begun to collect things. Not things of value, but things of meaning. I had made a shrine in what had once been a square. A child’s bear, clutched in a dead hand, a family photograph on a dusty mantelpiece, a battered copy of The Little Prince on a bench. All these things were shards of a broken world, mementos of what had been lost. I had sat for hours, trying to piece together the meaning of these objects, to make sense of what had happened. Was it a virus? The circle of stones I had placed around them, in which I arranged these stolen memories. Was it war? An act of God? I did not know. And perhaps I would never know. I spoke to them, whispering my thoughts, my fears into the silent air. They could not answer. The loneliness was a physical pain, a constant, hollow ache. One day I had found a mirror. It did not give me any peace of mind. It was only an object. But the image that stared back at me was gaunt, hollow-eyed, tangled, untended hair. I had not looked at myself for weeks. It was cracked and full of dust, but it reflected me. I was weak and my face was wasted.barely recognized myself. Was this all that was left? A shell of a person, haunted by the ghosts of a dead world? I wanted to scream, to rage, to break something. But there was no one to hear me, nothing left to break. So I just sat there, staring at my reflection, and a single tear traced a path down my dusty cheek. And in that moment, something shifted. A tiny spark of something flickered in the darkness. It wasn't hope, not yet. But it was something. A flicker of defiance, a refusal to be completely extinguished. Maybe, just maybe, survival wasn't just about existing. Maybe it was about remembering. About honoring the lives that had been lost.",

        " Here’s the continuation. “I expected to see him coming down the aisle, perhaps with his mother, perhaps even with his sweetheart. What a great start! There is a clear expectation and a hint of tension or disappointment. He looked smaller than I remembered, the strong light in the airport gave him a shadow under his eyes, which wasn’t in the pictures he sent. And instead of a happy couple, the incoming stream of people deposited him alone, a lone spectre, among the restless luggage and sluggish people. Where was everyone? My stomach was tight, not with butterflies, but with a persistent, dull anxiety. I pushed my way through the remaining throng and my carefully rehearsed greeting evaporated on my tongue. I expected a happy gathering, a tumultuous symphony of embraces and introductions. This felt... strange. He gave me a weak smile and waved hesitantly. He saw me then, and something flickered on his face, a sign of... relief? “Hello,” I said, trying to keep my voice upbeat. “Welcome back. Hey,” he said in a strangely flat tone. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, avoiding my eyes. “Where is everyone?” I asked, and the question hung in the air. My anxiety grew stronger. “They... couldn’t be there,” he said, and took hold of his worn suitcase, “long story.” This wasn’t the return I had expected, it was the beginning of something else. Long stories are never good news.",
        " My eyes were fixed on the object, the source of my passion. It was a chipped teacup. I clenched my jaw, so that the muscle ached. It seemed so silly, so stupid to feel this way over something so meaningless. A stupid chipped teacup, left on the side instead of being put in the dishwasher. My hands were shaking. But it was more than that. It was the accumulation of the little things, the persistent carelessness, the unspoken desires, which had built up, brick by brick, a wall of resentment. I wanted to scream, to break something, to let out the storm that was brewing inside me. But I didn’t. I wanted to sweep everything off the table, the teacup, the junk mail, the crumbs, everything. But I didn’t. Instead, I took a deep, shuddering breath, and pushed the anger down inside me, burying it deep beneath a thin, fragile layer of calm. It was like a thin sheet of ice over a choppy sea, which is about to break, and I knew that it would not hold for long. It was the crack, the first sign that the ice would soon break. I knew that when the dam finally burst, there would be no holding back.",
        " “Jesus Christ! Of all the characters one might have chosen to escape, you had to pick that one.” That one should be in the highest security section, and not strolling around the courtyard like a lord. Bartholomew Higgins, the man who thought doorknobs were edible and whose means of communication were mostly dancing and acting. “How in the name of all that is holy did he do it? Did he dance his way through the detection system?” Sergeant Miller pounded on the observation table, rattling the lukewarm coffee, which was on the edge of the table. The always pragmatist Commander rearranged his glasses, looked at the images on the screen, and said, “Well, sir, according to the camera he—well, he—it seems that he distracted everyone with a very lively performance of The Lonely Seagull, and picked the lock with a specially sharpened toothbrush.” “Then he got the guards to open his cell with an act?” “A specially sharpened toothbrush? The Lonely Seagull? ” Miller moaned, his face buried in his hands. His eyes narrowed as he peeked out between his fingers. “And where is Brenda? Is it possible that our entire security system could be bypassed by a man with a toothbrush and a seagull imitation?” “She appears to be—participating in Mr. Higgins’s performance, sir. She was on duty in that section.” He smothered a sound that was between laughter and sobbing. “She’s flapping her arms and making gull sounds.” “Gather a team, Jenkin. This is a nightmare. A beautiful, absurd nightmare.” “And for God’s sake, get me a recording of her seagull routine. We need to catch him before he starts teaching the inmates to forage for kelp in the mess hall.” The thought, chilling, hovered in his mind. He had to see it.to believe it.\"",
        " They were calm, calm, they had none of the fears that gnawed at me. I hated them, I hated their gentle smiles, their patience, a constant irritation which shook me from the inside, an eternal itching that I could not relieve. I screamed, I screamed, I spilled out all the deadlines, all the disappointments, all the injustices, and they only listened. Their calmness was a judgment, a silent accusation that I was not doing my best. They never got angry. They nodded, and said something vague and unobjectionable, like silver linings or lessons. It wasn't that I wanted them to share my pain. Not despair, not even a flash of anger, only that irritating, invincible calm. It wasn't that. I wanted them to see the absurdity of it, the chaotic messiness of it. But I wanted them to recognize, understand that the world wasn't all flowers and roses. I would have liked them to remind me of a nice day in the country. They recommended that I take a walk in the nature. They offered me herbal tea and a calming application on my phone. They were right. All of these things were perfectly reasonable, and that was what made it even worse. They were in the clouds, I was in the trenches, fighting the demons that they had easily banished. They were always right. It was as if I was a damaged record, constantly playing the same skip and not being able to get to the same level of wisdom. I knew it was unreasonable, it was unfair, even childish. And so the hatred boiled up. It was a smoldering anger, boiling, simmering, threatening to spill over and scald. In their calmness I saw my own weakness, an eternal reminder of the peace I could not reach. But I couldn't help it. I hated their savage smiles and their infernal patience.",
        " The train gave a last howl, like an animal drawing its last metallic breath. The train was at the end of the line. Clarity. But I was still, a statue cut out of the primary substance of realization. The usual symphony of arrivals and departures played around me—the fluttering footsteps, the tinny announcements, the rhythmic screeching of luggage. Here, on this anonymous platform, in the hard light of the station’s fluorescents, everything stopped. Not just the train. I stopped. I stopped for my life, for my choices, for the person I pretended to be. The truth hit me like a blow. I had been running after a mirage for years, trying to achieve the happiness and success that eluded me, sacrificed my relationships, ignored the darkness in my soul, fought tooth and nail to achieve a goal that was a mirage, a phantom, a meaningless mirage. A façade I had carefully constructed, but one that was starting to crack. A façade that was determined by expectations, by the fears of a society, by the fear of not succeeding. But here, at the end of the line, I had a choice. Looking at the people moving about in the crowd, I saw them buried in the same fears, in the same slow desperation. We all sat in the same train, rushing after the same goal, blindly following the same track. I could get back in, and keep up the masquerade, keep working, keep trying to distract myself, keep making up illusions. Or I could step off the train, take a deep breath, and find my own path. But the choice was not easy. What would people think? How would I survive? Fear whispered a dark tremor of uncertainty in my ear. But beneath the fear, a spark of hope. A tiny spark of possibility. Where would I go? I took a deep breath and picked up my worn leather bag. It was light. The bag was light, but my whole life was heavy. And I had a yearning. A yearning for something real.turned away from the waiting train, away from the familiar path, and towards the unknown. The end of the line. A terrifying, exhilarating, and ultimately liberating moment. A chance to start again. A chance to finally live.",
        " Through the skeletons of glass and iron the wind sang, it was a siren’s song promising wealth but leading to death. And not only from the precarious heights but from the dangers of the abysses. Few people dared climb up the ruins of the earth of what was once the island of Manhattan. Above the clouds were stories of untouched caches, forgotten luxuries, and even, some claimed, of functioning technology, forgotten from the “Ancient Times.” It was called the “Vertical Graveyard,” and with good reason. The climb up, using rusty fire-escapes and crumbling concrete, was already a bet against gravity. The risk was too great for most. But not everyone was so afraid. There was Wren. And then there were the mechanical defenses, the dormant, but still deadly, remnants of the old times. And the traps were countless. There was Wren. She had lost everything to the gangs down below, and these ruins, she saw, as a ladder to a better life. Wren with her nimble fingers and the gaze of a hawk, the ceaseless hunger for survival. Down below the flickering fires of the shanty-towns died in the darkness, the jagged outlines of the skyscrapers stabbed at the sunless sky. A piece of rope, gathered from some fishing boat long since rotted, a rough strip of something that, for her, was nothing more than a bare string to hang onto. Today, she was going to climb the Empire State Building. They said there was a hidden safe on the observation deck, that it held enough tinned food to feed a small village for a year. It was a long shot, a fool’s quest, but she had nothing left to lose. And, so, she took a deep breath, let the metallic smells of rust cling to her mouth, and set out.of the polluted air stinging her nostrils. The wind picked up, tugging at her threadbare clothes. \"Wish me luck, old girl,\" she murmured to the tower, her voice swallowed by the wind. Then, she began to climb.",
        " He leaned closer, the smell of wood smoke and something faintly spicy adhering to him. ‘Not until now,’ he said, smiling, with a mischievous look in his eyes. ‘Do you feel embarrassed or pleased by the thought that I’m thinking of you?’ He let the question hang in the air, a challenge. ‘Neither,’ I said in a breathless voice, ‘I’m just... curious.’ I tried to meet his gaze, but his eyes were too piercing and too knowing. ‘Curiosity, you know,’ he said, raising one eyebrow with a look that said: ‘Really?’ He laughed, a deep, sonorous laugh that shook me. ‘ All right then. It’s that feeling of being pleased that brings it back,’ I retorted, trying to regain my composure. ‘ And anyway,’ he added with a touch of seriousness, ‘it would be a pity to spoil your surprise, wouldn’t it?’ He took a step back, putting an end to the closeness that had made my heart beat so fast. What surprise was he talking about? And what a fire there was in his eyes, reflecting the uncertainty that shook me. He didn’t answer my question and went to poke the dying embers of the fire. Suddenly I wasn’t so sure I wanted to know.",

        " There was no rebellion among the fowls. They did not go rioting through the farmhouse, demanding their rights. They were happy laying their eggs, despite Mr.Gregor’s continuous grumbling about “the freeloaders.” And the squirrels? They did not suddenly devise a complicated system of bartering with the neighborhood cats. No coup in the nest. No economic summits between rodents and felines, no trade agreements between them. And so, nothing happened to shake the natural order. Herr Flicker continued to chase them up the oak tree with his usual ferocity, and the squirrels went on burying their acorns as haphazardly and forgetfully as ever. Nothing unusual happened. There were no talkative animals, no magical vegetables, no lawn gnomes catching fire. The birds sang, the bees buzzed, and the neighbors argued about lawn maintenance, as always. The world remained stubbornly, delightfully, and perhaps even disappointingly predictable.",
        " I gripped the scratched, thin, cheaply made plastic armrest, which was slick in my sweaty palms. Every time they shouted “Number forty-four hundred and ninety-three” it was like a blow to the base of my skull. The light above me hummed, an atonal, rhythmic sound that echoed and blended with the same tune. I wasn’t here for an examination. I wasn’t here for a cure. Laughter, even a little chuckle, would have sent a sharp stab of pain to my temples, reminding me of the pressure behind my eyes. It was a cruel irony to look for pain to escape it. But that was my reality. I was here for the pain. The sweet, numbing pain that the doctor, in his white coat and cold, detached professional manner, would prescribe for me. The waiting room was like a tableau of mute despair. A young mother rocked her restless child, her face a mask of exhaustion. All around us, in the office, there was a dark, oppressive mood. Everything was a migraine: the long-term, low-level humming that threatened to explode in an atonal symphony of pain. Each one of them was waiting for something. For a moment when he would have a small piece of his life back from the grip of illness and infirmity. An old man with a crumpled newspaper in his hands concentrated intently. Number forty-four hundred and ninety-three. I felt my heart beating harder, nervously. “Number forty-four hundred and ninety-three, proceed to Room Three.” The voice went on, unaware of the suffering it broke into. I got up slowly, my stiff muscles aching. Room Three, the small, sterile room where I would find my relief, however temporary. I paused at the door and breathed deeply. Perhaps this time, perhaps this time. Each step was a victory, the will I muster to function. Perhaps this time, maybe I’ll be able to laugh without pain. Perhaps this time the relief would last longer. But the truth was I knew it. The pain would always be there, in the shadows, waiting., ready to pounce. And I would always be waiting, too, in the sterile silence of waiting rooms, for the fleeting respite that would allow me to face another day.",
        " Having had enough of the monotony of his everyday existence, he decided to take some action. It was a particularly sunny Tuesday, a few minutes after lunch, on an early November day, that Patrick was finally sick of it all. He looked out the window, past the car park shimmering in the autumn sun, to the distant hazy hills. The fluorescent lamps were singing their monotonous dirge, the same dirge they had been singing for seven years, three months and seventeen days, he knew this because he had started counting shortly after the decline of his spirit. He inhaled deeply, and the stale smell of stale coffee and despair was choking his nostrils. He could imagine himself climbing the hills, with the wind blowing through his greying hair, free of his folders and reports. They looked to him like something alluring, adventurous, with secrets which would never be revealed by the cream walls of the Apex Paper Works. Then again, Brenda began. “Then a minute later, to cap it all, mittens coughed up a kidney, and shit it all over the Persian carpet....” The fantasy was so clear, he could almost feel the branches scratching against his khakis. It was over, it was all over, the Persian carpet, the small furry heart, the hopeless predictability of all of Brenda’s anecdotes, the last straw. Patrick pushed back his chair, the hard plastic scraping on the linoleum rang in the sudden silence. “Patrick? Is everything alright?” she asked, her mouth slightly open, with the fork poised over a half-chewed bite of her own tuna sandwich. He had his hand in his desk drawer, not for the stapler, or his company-supplied pen, but for the map, the old one, the torn and tattered one, he had hidden there for months. He rose from his chair, his height suddenly dominating the office, a weary giant, and pulled out the map. He did not answer. The map was a trail map of the Appalachian Trail, with the campsites numbered and marked in red circles.handwritten notes about water sources. He smoothed it out on his desk, the crinkling paper the loudest sound in the office. He glanced at Brenda, who was now staring at him with a mixture of confusion and concern. He met her gaze, a flicker of something akin to defiance in his eyes. \"I'm going for a walk,\" he announced, his voice surprisingly steady. He folded the map, tucked it into his pocket, and walked towards the door, leaving his half-eaten tuna sandwich, his overflowing inbox, and the hum of the fluorescent lights behind him. He didn't know where he was going, or what he would do, but he knew one thing: he wasn't coming back. Not today. Not tomorrow. Maybe not ever. The hills were calling, and",
        " The porcelain is dancing on the stove like my soul. It is for you I long and I cry for you in the hissing steam of the kettle. It is for you that I scream. The scent of Earl Grey tea, usually a consolation, mocks me with its gentle tameness. How can I steep tea when I’m boiling with longing? Every whistling cry is a longing plea, a mysteriously coded message sent into the void, to find a response in your heart. My love, come before the kettle boils dry and my heart turns to dust. The sugar bowl is not touched. There is nothing sweet that can console me.",
        " She bit her teeth, uttering a grunt; her stance shifted, she groped about, feeling her limits, a strand of fiery hair escaped from its complicated braid and clung to her damp cheek. She strained against her invisible bonds, the muscular ripples spread like waves across her skin. She was obviously fighting, but what was she fighting against, and how long would she last? In spite of the fear that was undoubtedly gnawing at her, a spark of defiance still shone in her green eyes, a promise that she would not yield. The air was heavy with the odour of the forest, a very different odour from the perfume of the mountains that was her usual scent.",
        " Until, one Tuesday, it was not so. With the boring lecture of opium wars, the continuity of dates and treaties blurred in a sea of historical oblivion, and the book with the weight of the abyss, I only kept my eyes down, so as not to drown in the Qing dynasty. But the sun was playing with the dust of the air in the afternoon, and the fact that the French Revolution was still not opened, made me look up, and she was there. Despite the frantic speed with which we were taking down the words from Mr. Henderson, she was painting a world full of fantastic creatures and imaginary landscapes in her notebook. She was in the second row, one seat to the left, and her hair was tumbling down the back of her head, a cascade of dark, almost black curls, occasionally obscuring the intricate drawing she was drawing on the page. And even the rhythmic scratch of her pen seemed to have a song. Then the opium wars seemed not to matter at all. I couldn't see her face, but her graceful neck and the swaying of her shoulders, completely contrasting with the stiffness of the entire class, were filled with a beauty that was absent in all other things. My eyes shrank and focused on the painters in the corner. Who was she? And the dates, and the treaties, and the porcelain - all merged into a dull noise in the background. But then Mr. Hennessy, who noticed my distraction, asked me about the impact of the industrial revolution on child labor. I tried to steal a look, to catch a glimpse of her face. But, sensing my distraction, he chose to make a question to me, about the fact that in such a room, which was a monument to the eternal history, the beauty of the flow of time was so great. I stammered, saying something about factories and bad working conditions, and then received a scornful look and a remark about the importance of attention. My mind froze, only the black hair, the dancing pen, and I forgot everything. The humiliation was too much for me, and I sank back into the book, hiding my face in my lap.my seat, my cheeks burning. But even the sting of Mr. Henderson's disapproval couldn't completely extinguish the spark of curiosity that had been ignited. I had to know her name. And maybe, just maybe, learn how to draw a fantastical creature or two myself. The only problem was, I was pretty sure she hadn't even registered my existence. After all, I was just the guy who couldn't remember the date of the Battle of Waterloo. This was going to be harder than passing AP History.",
        " You didn’t want to think about it. You sank down into the worn leather of the cab, the smell of stale cigarettes and cheap perfume soothed you after... whatever it was. The city lights in front of you were streaked with gold and white. Each illuminated window, each shadowy street corner seemed to hold a secret, a potential danger, a reminder of the uneasy feeling you had not yet managed to shake off. You gave the cabby your address and watched the buildings as they slid past. Not yet. The silence in the car was thick, broken only by the hum of the engine and the crackle of the radio. You told yourself it was the weariness of it, the shock coming to an end, but doubt was still lingering, prickling at the back of your neck, refusing to be ignored. You didn’t want to talk about it. You were grateful for his indifference. He seemed oblivious to your internal struggle, absorbed in his own life, his world of traffic and fares. You paid the cabby, the clinking of coins jarred in the stillness of the night. You didn’t want to relive it. Finally the cab pulled up to your building. Your house rose up before you, a brick fortress against the turmoil of the city. Your hands trembled as you fished for your keys. Walking across the sidewalk was like stepping back into the present, a present that was now less safe, less certain. You quickly locked the door behind you, the sound reverberating in the silence. The key turned in the lock, you pushed the door open, the familiar smell of old books and lavender spread out through the hallway into your room, the door closed behind you, and the room itself, a room that was too small but familiar, its narrow walls a safe refuge, stood waiting for you, the keys still in your hand. What to do? Call someone? The police? No... not yet. You didn’t know what to tell them anyway. You needed to recover your balance, to restore order. You took off your shoes, the soft slap of the heels against the floor a welcome sound.cy in the aftermath of... whatever it was. You walked towards the kitchen, the familiar creak of the floorboards a comforting rhythm. What would you do now? What would you do to make sense of what happened? And most importantly, how would you shake off the feeling that you were still being watched?",
        " On the edge of the field, the cool earth was soft under our bare feet. The morning sun was already warm in our faces, and the dew-touched grass shone in its bright rays. The birds were all singing their songs, and the day was born with a vigorous symphony. In the distance, a solitary curl of smoke from a chimney told of the tranquil life of the countryside. A gentle breeze stirred the tops of the corn, rustling as if they were whispering a quiet, hidden secret, while a few weeds were also growing in the dry ditches. The golden glow on my companion’s face told me that this would be a day to remember.",
        " Not just any class—Professor Abernathy’s class in advanced quantum mechanics, where a single missed lecture meant a trip straight into a sea of Schrödinger’s equations and Heisenberg’s uncertainties. I was going to be late. My stomach churned in the familiar pattern of fear and self-reproach. Each second stretched into an eternity. I searched for my keys, digging in the depths of my overstuffed book bag—books, receipts, a half-eaten energy bar—the usual suspects. Eventually, I felt the cold metal of the key in my palm. I raced out of my room and almost ran into Mrs. Higgins, the hall monitor, who sat glowering with a clipboard perpetually in her hand. “Good morning, my dear!” she chirped in a voice full of that strange sugary sweetness that always sounded as if it were covering something. I gave a hurried wave and rushed down the corridor. The campus was a flurry of activity, people rushing to their various classes in a chaotic rush of footsteps and voices. I dodged a skateboarder, slipped past a gaggle of sorority girls, and jumped over a rogue backpack abandoned in the middle of the sidewalk. The clock chimed the hour, and each chime echoed in my ears with a rising note of panic. My lungs burned as I ran down the hill toward the physics building, a familiar red brick tower like a beacon of hope and impending disaster. I turned a corner and saw it: the bell. The bell that meant that I might catch the last ten minutes of class. The bell that meant I might catch the last five. The bell that... and the physics building wasn’t there. What I saw was... a construction site. A large, empty space. Orange cones marking off the perimeter. Cranes and other heavy machinery, all humming.sign read: \"Physics Building Closure - Renovations Underway. Classes Relocated to the Old Auditorium.\" The Old Auditorium? That was on the *other* side of campus. And it was at least a fifteen-minute walk. My late status just catapulted into the realm of utterly, irrevocably screwed.",
        " Each day I begged Captain Rauf to let me join his squad of heroes, but each day he gave me the same answer: a cold shake of his head and a brusque \"Not yet, kid. Today was the day! I had just been looking him up and down with his solitary good eye (the other was masked by a patch) and, like an inspector examining a defective part, he said to me, \"You are not ready.\" \"All right, kid,\" he mumbled, \"you want to run with the big boys? I will let you in. \" Then he heaved a sigh that sounded like a tire being punctured. My heart pounded against my ribs. \" Well, good luck to you. Don't come crying to me if they knock your legs out from under you.\" I was vibrating with joy. \"I won't, Captain. I promise!\" The room was ablaze with a tension you only find among heroes preparing for an emergency. As I stood in the dimly lit operation room of the League headquarters, I felt another kind of vibration, one that came from nerves trembling in anticipation of an important mission. The five members of the squad, the so-called \"Ironclads,\" were sitting at a table in a circle, their green uniforms rumpled as if a washcloth had been passed over them. Captain Rauf, a huge grizzled veteran with a ragged uniform, stood at the head of the table. Next came Lumina, the Light Constructor, whose eyes glowed with an inner light. Finally, Bolt, the Electrifier, the ultimate conductor of electricity, whose eyes crackled with a barely restrained energy. Terra, the Earth Constructor, sat beside him with her stony, calm, yet commanding presence. Rauf cleared his throat in a voice like a lawn mower with a heavy load. \" Listen up, kid. \" They were each living legends, and I was just an ordinary kid, about to be an intern. \"We have a problem in the city. A new superhuman menace, who calls himself the Glitch. You know the drill: get in, get out. \"ms to be able to manipulate technology, shutting down systems, controlling drones, the whole shebang.\" He gestured towards a holographic projection displaying a grainy image of a figure cloaked in static electricity. \"We need to shut him down before he does any real damage. Ironclad Five, you know the drill. Velocity, you're scouting. Terra, you're on crowd control. Lumina, provide visual support. Bolt, you're the heavy hitter. And you,\" he pointed a thick finger at me, \"Leo. You're with me. You're gonna be my eyes and ears, run interference, and try not to get yourself killed.\" Run interference? My eyes and ears? That sounded...important. More important than I expected. I gulped, trying to swallow down the lump in my throat. \"Any questions?\" Captain",
        " The border is the writhing, corrupt line carved in the earth by the sands of blood and the plight of broken alliances, moving and shifting according to the whims of the kings and the wind of fortune. Here the races meet, a thousand kingdoms of a thousand ways, fighting or sharing bread and wine, cross their swords or they share their crops, they share nothing but the border. The elves, inaccessible and ancient, watch it from the shining forests, intervening sometimes with whispered prophecies and delicate intercessions, their reasons as inscrutable as the stars. Sometimes there is a trickle of commerce between them, spices and silks for heavy steel and dwarven work, sometimes a rushing torrent of invasion, nourished by old hatreds and the lust for new fields. Mankind, forever ambitious, spreads like fire over the plains, building kingdoms and tearing them down with equal zeal. The goblins, a swarming tide of green skin and sharp teeth, fill the outskirts and thrive on the chaos of the border. The dwarves, stubborn as the mountains they carve out, hold fast to their hammers, and utter defiance against any who would threaten their mastery over stone and metal. And for each alliance, a hundred betrayals. There a human knight may fall in love with an elfish princess, and theirs is the first love that builds a bridge across the gulf of centuries of enmity. There a dwarven clan may make a pact with a goblin tribe, and their alliances can stand as a fearsome force in the caves and the tunnels of the mountain. There, for each field of crops shared, there are a thousand stolen from the enemy. For each drop of wine shared, there are barrels of blood spilled in anger. There, the border is. The history is written, there. There, in the night of the world, there are countless things, of hopes and of despair, of kingdoms built and of kingdoms destroyed. There, in the endless moment, hope and despair are inseparable.in the clash of steel, the whispers of magic, and the desperate struggle for survival.",
        " The atmosphere was heavy, oppressive, sickly sweet, and pervaded with the metallic taste of blood. On the table a word had been carved in the wood, on a pile of bones, and the surrounding wood was splintered, and was a disturbing, almost rusty brown. I paused, and the flashlight trembled in my hand. What had impelled me to follow the rumors to this abandoned hut? Flies buzzed sluggishly, their iridescent bodies flashing in the moonlight which entered through the chinks in the boards of the windows. The bones were small, too small to be human. The stories of the hermit, the witchcraft, and the nocturnal rituals, a folk tale dismissed by the village, were suddenly more terrifying than ever. A chill went up my spine. Bird bones, perhaps? Or... smaller still? All the bones were white, and there were no feathers or fur, only a disorderly, disturbing pile, with a chilling, disturbing warning on it. I made an effort to focus my eyes, and to note every detail. Don’t... touch. What? Don’t touch what? Don’t... continue? The question echoed in the oppressive silence of the hut, a silent scream that racked my sanity. Don’t look? On the wall, in a corner, there was a row of shelves overflowing with bottles containing... something. A rusty cauldron was filled with a sticky, black mud in the fireplace. I took a step back, and something crunched under my heel. There were dried herbs, but also things I couldn’t identify—curled roots, dried mushrooms, and something which looked disturbingly like pickled eyes. I shone my flashlight on the floor. There were more bones. I had to leave, immediately. The whole hut was a charnel house. But something resisted me, a morbid curiosity perhaps. The solitary word, carved so emphatically in a final desperate gesture, was enough to turn my back on the hut. Nevertheless, a nagging doubt gnawed at my mind. What if the solitary word on the bones was a cipher, a secret code, something that I would never find out, or understand?nagging feeling that I was missing something. I moved towards the cauldron, my heart pounding against my ribs. The stench emanating from it was overpowering, a nauseating blend of decay and something acrid, almost chemical. I held my breath and peered inside. Beneath the sludge, something glinted. Metal. With a trembling hand, I reached for a piece of wood and used it to stir the contents of the cauldron. The sludge parted, revealing a small, silver locket. It was intricately carved with a design of intertwined vines and leaves. I lifted it out, the cold metal a stark contrast to the clammy heat of my palm. As I wiped away the grime, a small inscription became visible. \"Sarah.\" The name was barely legible, etched in a shaky, almost frantic hand. And as I stared at it, a new,",
        " For \"God,\" I learned, is not a person, a bearded man with a crown and a ring. I searched far and wide for him, but I couldn't find him. Maybe that's the point of the whole search, A wild and free inward journey. \"God\" is found in a friend's generosity, In the strength that gives courage, In the beauty of a sunrise, In the peace that the night brings. He is a more profound reality, A woven tapestry all around. He speaks to you in a quiet voice, He helps you grow with intuition. He's in the knowledge you acquire, In the passion of a warm fire. He's in the compassion that fills your heart, In the bright and new, with hope and promise. He's not a cold, stern judge, He's energy to help you learn. He doesn't offer easy paths, But strength to face the labyrinth. And when you are lost and in despair, Remember that it's expensive to look outside for a guide, When the answers are all within. So turn your attention inward and you will see, The \"God\" you seek is in you, A potentiality to make a change, To fill the world with light and love. True divinity, you see, Is not a thing, but a being. But don't go searching for \"God\" in a polished shell, Because it is not a thing but a being. So live, with resolve and passion, Then you will find the \"God\" in you.",
        " I felt a numb feeling at my back, an almost invisible ring of leather that seemed more of a luxury than a device of imprisonment. I felt a numb ache, a dull, throbbing ache, which pulsed with the sound of the clock, which ticked so loudly that every minute, like a hammer blow, struck my skull. The room was a study in opulent restraint, with its cream walls, Persian rug, which seemed to be impossibly soft underfoot, and a resonant art collection. The cuffs that held me were, surprisingly, surprisingly gentle, not digging into the skin, but definitely and inviolably holding me. A great wave of panic threatened to overflow in me, but I forced myself to breathe deeply. In the corner, under the soft light of a glass shade, a piano was silent, a great gentleman was sitting on a chair, but a man was tied to a chair. I tried to remember what had happened before I woke up here, but I could not remember. Panic did not help. I had to see the situation clearly. It wasn't like the usual ransom note and duck tape. Had I been robbed? Was I a victim of a drug overdose? Nothing, only the deafening silence and the ticking of the clock. I rushed around the room with my eyes, searching for some kind of clue, some kind of sign of my captor. Then I heard it, a distant, at first almost imperceptible melody came from somewhere. A violin, a sweet and sad violin. Whoever was playing it was about to enter here. The melody was approaching. My heart was pounding in my throat. I was thinking about how to behave, how to act, what to say. I wanted to beg for mercy. I wanted to be hard and demand answers. The door opened and a man stepped into the room. It was not a cruel and formidable man. The melody stopped. Tall, thin, a woman, with long, flowing hair.auburn hair that cascaded down her back. She wore a simple, elegant dress, and her face was pale and serene. She looked more like a ghost than a kidnapper. She held a violin in her left hand, the bow still resting on the strings. Her eyes, a startling shade of green, met mine. They held a strange mixture of sadness and curiosity. \"Ah, you're awake,\" she said, her voice soft and melodic, like the music she had been playing. \"I was beginning to think you'd sleep forever.\" She tilted her head slightly, studying me with an unsettling intensity. \"Don't worry,\" she added, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. \"I won't hurt you. Not yet, anyway.\"",
        " — He was not grotesque in the usual sense. I have seen some funny ones in my time, but this one? It was... the intensity. He looked at you as if he was excising your soul with rusty tweezers. No extra limbs, no skin diseases, nothing horrible on the outside. He had a white-blond, anti-gravity head and eyes the color of flint. Tall, gangling, dressed in a perfectly tailored tweed suit, looking completely out of place amongst the flannels and canvas, with a white-blond mustache. I saw him for the first time at the local market, hovering around the heirloom tomatoes. But his look... it lingered. He was not buying, he was just... observing. He watched the farmers haggling, the children chasing the pigeons, the dogs sniffing each other's tails. Then he would smile. The smile was heavy. It was a pincer. It didn't reach his eyes. They remained cold and calculating. The smile was the slow unfolding of his lips, showing a set of teeth that was too sharp, too white, almost predatory. — I tried to ignore him, looked at the peaches. But I felt his presence, a presence like the electric shock of the air. When I looked back, he was gone. At the library, he read a book about rare mushrooms in silence. I saw him everywhere during the following weeks. He didn't say a word. In a greasy spoon late at night, sipping a black coffee and staring out the window at the deserted street. In the park, drawing the pigeons with a too precise rigor. But always that damn smile, hovering above his lips. No interference, just observing. He smiled as if he knew something you didn't, and was enjoying that. He smiled like someone who had a secret to tell, something you didn't want to know. It was his smile that made me sick, I think. That's why he gets the prize.It wasn't about physical deformities or outlandish behavior. It was the unsettling feeling that he was playing a game, and we were all just pawns on his bizarre, unspoken chessboard. And I had a feeling, a sickening certainty, that the game wasn't going to end well.",
        " In the air there is a faint smell of paper, and something flowery—the remnants of some potpourri forgotten long ago. The sunlight, broken up by the blinds, painted a faint rainbow across the room—abandoned books, a rickety chair, a chipped china cup on the table. The silence is profound, broken only by the sound of the house settling and the distant drone of traffic. You blink, adjusting to the light, and the day stretches out in front of you, a blank canvas, awaiting the first stroke. Will you bury yourself in a favourite book? What will you do? The possibilities hang in the air, heavy with the possibility of any choice. Will you venture forth into the world? Or will you stay at home, happy in your solitude, watching the sunlight move and dance? You make your choice. What will you do?",
        " \"Hey!\" I struck the tin-plated iron sash of my cart. \" He-ho! \" I have to. This harsh metallic noise was intended to break through the city's clamor, and to attract the attention of passers-by. The sound reverberated through the narrow alley, reverberated on the brick walls of the houses which hemmed me in. It was bad. I didn't look for that. A skinny stray cat, wary and skinny, darted from under a overflowing refuse bin, and his yellow eyes fixed me with suspicion. \"Here are some fresh berries! Pick 'em yourself, sun-softened and plump!\" I yelled, and my voice cracked a little with the effort. In the air was a mingled smell of the exhaust of motor cars and something vaguely flowery, perhaps from the wilted window-boxes of the upper floors. Not exactly an odor to sell fresh fruit, but you can't ask for everything. \"Berries! Strawberries, raspberries, blue-berries!\" I rapped harder on the sash, \"berries, strawberries, raspberries, blue-berries!...\" Suddenly a window in the third story opened opposite, and a woman leaned out of it, a cigarette between her lips and curls in her hair. \" Just off the farm!\" I yelled. I felt a spark of hope. \"How much for a pint of strawberries?\" she called down, her voice squealing. \" Five dollars, ma'am!...\" \"You're robbing me! I had them for three-fifty at the market last week.\" She drew on her cigarette, and exclaimed: \"Pick 'em yourself, just off the farm, I bring 'em to your door!\" She hesitated, thought a bit. I wished I could put some spirit into it. \" All right, all right,\" she said at last, and threw a cloud of cigarette ash into the alley. \" Make it four-fifty, if you please.\" The cat, feeling that I might be distracted, crept nearer to the cart, his wagging tail erect. \"Deal!\" I cried, almost shouting with relief. \"I'll bring 'em upstairs!\" I hurriedly picked out a pint of the juiciest strawberries I had, and snatched them up, but the cat got nervous, slipped farther away and disappeared.dest strawberries, carefully arranging them to look their most appealing. This might be the start of a good day after all. Maybe.",
        " I had been insignificant, a flickering candle in the hurricane, a whisper in a shout, a drop in a flood. I could influence the outcome, but never wreak a revolution. I could cause a man to blink a bit longer, but never fire up his passion. I could confuse a politician, but never alter his views. I could keep a lover’s gaze a bit longer, but never alight it. The presence of this unseen, this invisible hand was a comforting one in my life, a kind, guiding hand that helped me to overcome everyday obstacles. I could find a spot in the car park, get the last reduced cake in the baker’s, find myself at the front of the queue at the grocer’s. But lately these everyday things had begun to feel wrong. I felt a sense of failure in my small, insignificant power. The world was torn by the constant devastations, both natural and human-made. It was like a ship without a helm, heading for the cliffs. That thought was a cold shiver in my stomach. Was that all I could do? Just grease the wheels of my own easy existence while the world was crashing about me? It was not the normal, friendly, but almost beseeching, whisper in my ear. It was an urgent and almost angry demand. Then one evening, staring at the news on the screen while yet another report on climate change was flashed up, something quite different occurred to me. The world was collapsing. I had no effect, or so it seemed. Then I focused on the screen, on the melting ice and the parched land, and I poured all my anger, my fear, my need into the power that had always been so small. Suddenly the news was different the following morning, not radically, but subtly. A small but influential group of investors had pulled out of a large fossil fuel project. The stock exchange had reacted unexpectedly. A politician had given a passionate speech in favour of renewable energy. It could have been coincidence. And for the first time in a long while I felt something that was not just comfort. Probably it was coincidence. But the seed of hope was in the air. Perhaps, just perhaps, my little candle could still cast a shadow. I felt a flicker of hope., if I aimed it right, it could even ignite a flame.",
        " I turned the tail over in my hands, examined it. There was no blood, no tatters, no trace of injury. The fur was surprisingly soft, a mute grey, like storm clouds. A shiver ran down my spine, and it was not because of the early morning chill. It was not quite right. It was as though it had just... fallen off. Even if it had been broken cleanly, there would have been some sign, some residue of pain. I looked about me, at the dew-drenched grass of the garden. A cat does not shed its tail. There was no sign of the cat, I was alone, with the severed tail. The air was still, the only sound was a few far-off birdsongs. Was the cat gone, leaving only this behind? Or was this a special kind of cat shedding, of which I had never heard? My imagination began to turn. My heart was pounding, a drumbeat of terror. Perhaps I was going mad. Slowly, cautiously, I followed a slight crease in the grass, a delicate trail that led to the overgrown roses at the far end of the garden. Not a mangled carcass, not a shadowy prey, but a fox. I pushed aside the thorny branches, and shivered when a few pricked me in the sleeve. There, in the midst of the roses, a cat. No, this was stranger still. It was an ordinary cat, a grey tabby, but it was not a cat. Its eyes were closed, it was sitting motionless, with an eerie, disturbing peace about it. It twitched its bright orange tail, and yawned slowly and deliberately. The grey cat opened one eye, looked at me, with a mild and bored expression. A long moment of indecision, a complete, complete indecision. Then I understood. The cat had not been killed by curiosity. It had merely... shed. The question remained open. I dropped the grey tail.answered. Some mysteries are better left to the cats.",

        " Halfway to the prickly place my hand was automatically tracing the familiar path down my thigh to the prick. I wanted to scratch my leg—at least that’s what it looked like. My fingers hovered a mere millimeter from the prickly place. But the urge to scratch was not merely a mere itch. A flicker of consciousness. Suddenly and sharply, as it were, a ray of awareness penetrated the dull fog of habit. I let my hand fall slowly, staring at my leg. I felt a faint warmth rising from the fabric. The urge to scratch was still there, in a persistent, murmuring background, but it was crowded out by something deeper, more threatening. A rash? A swelling I hadn’t noticed before? Something had changed? Nothing. Smooth, ordinary skin. I drew up my trousers a little, revealing a narrow strip of pale flesh. It seemed to me—my leg felt exposed, as if under surveillance. And the feeling, a prickly disquiet which had nothing to do with scratching, lingered on. The din in the café—cups clattering, people murmuring, the hiss of the espresso machine—felt as if it were a distant, humming hum. As if a thousand tiny eyes were fixed on that place. I stood frozen, my senses heavy and dull. I slowly scanned the room, one ear on the humming hum. Then nothing but the prickly place, the growing certainty that I was not alone.",
        " Then he would move on to the nursery, his arm having no height, only the length of a slender, thin, bone-like finger, the hand of a child, which thrusts in the place of the infant’s teeth, where there is nothing but a void, the hollowness of the jaw-bone. At first, he picks his teeth idly, and it is strange to watch a skeleton pick his teeth. The dust-motes dance in the sunlight, which falls on his skull and iridizes it with gold. He looks almost... peaceful. Yet he is content with his efforts, and laughs a silent, dry chuckle from his ribs. And the peace is shattered. He turns his hollow sockets towards me, and the peace is shattered.",
        " His voice was not yet angry, but it was full of deep sorrow, which made the question all the more unbearable. “Why have you done this?” He asked, and the question echoed in the vast, empty space before them. His question made the being in front of Him tremble with horror, though He was a being of great power. It was a being who had once shone like a beacon, but who was now flickering like a dying ember. “I wanted to know what it was like, to feel, to really feel,” He finally whispered, in a voice that was a dry, hollow whisper barely audible in the infinite space around them. “To feel what, Azazel? Power?” “You felt, Azazel, that you wanted to feel the same things as me,” God said, releasing a sigh that sounded like the whispering of galaxies. “To feel the same way? You had every power, you were created with the very power of creation in you.” “But it was all in theory, in your mind. You never saw me, never experienced me, never felt me.” Azazel dropped his head. The darkness deepened around him. “I saw them, these humans, I saw how they lived, how they felt joy, pain, love, hate— I wanted to know what it was like, to be able to feel that, to have that physical contact.” “And you thought that corrupting them, driving them astray, would show you the wonder of feeling?” God said, trembling. “And what have you learned, Azazel?” Azazel said, His voice barely audible, “I thought that by experiencing the extremes, I would understand the whole range, and know darkness, that I would understand light.” “Have you found what you sought, in the suffering that you have caused? Do you know love better, after corrupting it into lust?” God asked, letting the question hang in the air, unable to answer it. Azazel was silent, the shadows surrounding him like a shroud. He looked up, his face appearing momentarily, and in his eyes something that seemed like regret flickered. “Do you understand joy better, after turning it into a fleeting, empty pleasure?” Azazel looked down. “I was wrong,” He finally admitted.words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"I sought understanding through destruction, and I only found emptiness.\" God looked at him, a profound sadness etched on his face. \"You sought to understand humanity, Azazel, but you failed to understand yourself. You were already created with the capacity for love, for compassion. You simply chose to ignore it.\" He paused, then added, his voice filled with a quiet sorrow, \"And now, you must bear the weight of your choices.\" The silence stretched, unbroken but for the faint whisper of the cosmos. Azazel looked down, the weight of his actions finally settling upon him, a burden heavier than any he had ever imagined. He had sought to understand the human experience, but in doing so, he had",
        " Sunlight, an agreeable intruder, came through the chink in the curtains and bathed a dusty rectangle on the floor. I narrowed my eyes, trying to get used to the brightness. The sound of groans and creaks came from me in protest and resounded in the otherwise quiet room. I needed coffee. The first thought that came to my head was coffee.",
        " After all my painstaking work, the hours spent chasing the light, the carefully worked-out compositions, the emotional investment I made in every frame—and it comes down to a fingernail! My blood was boiling. I squeezed the phone even harder and read the comments, which were like needles in my side. And not even a good fingernail. It was a tiny, almost imperceptible shadow, a trick of the light, on the model’s shoulder. “Fake!” “Illogically beautiful!” “Poser!” The irony was almost unbearable. That was what I was trying to fight with my photography, the pretentions of this society, the lies, the pretense, the inhumanity. I wanted to scream. I wanted to defend myself, explain the lighting, the pose, the model’s natural proportions. But now, because of a slight flaw, a phantom nipple, I was being accused of perpetrating the very thing I was trying to fight. The verdict was in. I wanted to post the RAW file, just to shut them up, but I knew that wouldn’t make any difference. I threw the phone down on the couch and began to pace up and down the room, my fury mounting. The mob had spoken, guilty! Maybe I was another deluded artist, another disappointment, another failure. Maybe I should give up. But then something happened, a spark of defiance flickered inside me. And a cold hand pressed itself on my heart. No! I wouldn’t let them win. I wouldn’t let a damn nipple dictate my value! I breathed deeply, trying to calm myself. I had something to say, to show the world. And I wouldn’t be silenced by these hypocritical jackasses, who hid behind their keyboards. I wasn’t going to answer their comments. I wasn’t going to engage with them. So—new plan: I would create images with even more power. I would throw myself into my work., images so undeniably authentic that they would silence the doubters. Images that would scream, \"This is real! This is human! This is beautiful!\" I walked over to my camera, its cold metal a comforting weight in my hands. I had a shoot scheduled for tomorrow. It was time to get to work. This nipple-gate bullshit was over. It was time to show them what I was really capable of. The hell with them. I'd show them real.",
        " The fallen trees, the crumbling walls, the desolate walls... each and every one carries a story of pain, each a great woe, which makes the same wound in our souls. The colours of life have faded under the scorching sun of suffering. We remember our former joy like a tattered flag in a storm. The symphony of the jungle, once a symphony of life, now seems like a relentless mockery of our fragility. The road before us is always encumbered with the thorns of doubt and despair. We stumble, our feet slowed down by the heavy burden of the sight we have seen. But deep within us a flame still burns. We look for signs, we seek for a glimmer of hope in the tangled undergrowth, a lighthouse which will guide us through the darkness. Those are the words of that flame which whispers to us that a dull sword may be sharpened, that the longest journey has its end. Embers of hope are buried in the ashes of our torment, they lie quietly beneath the weight of our misery. For even in this interminable jungle, it is still possible to find the clearing. It is up to us to find the strength to fan those embers, to bring them back to life, to walk on, step by step.",
        " In some ways, it’s true. They say that finding your mate is one of the best things you can do in your life. They paint a picture of perfect mates, made in the heavens, bound by a lifelong contract, sharing a passion that makes life richer and more meaningful. But in the fairy tale, nothing is impossible. The fairy tale isn’t always a guide to reality. The idea that someone understands you, that someone has seen your dark side and still loves you is a comforting thought. In reality, however, it takes more than a simple inclination to love. It takes daily decisions, week after week, when the enchantment fades, and when the problems accumulate. It takes a person who can change you, who is willing to grow up with you, who is willing to face life’s problems with you, who wants to face them with you, who has to compromise and communicate. Perhaps, just perhaps, the idea of a mate isn’t about destiny at all. Maybe it’s about choice, about deciding to love, about wanting to build a deep and meaningful connection with someone else. Perhaps the most important thing is to find your mate in your life; perhaps it’s recognizing that person in your life, the friend who loves you unconditionally, the family member who loves you deeply, the lover who wants to do the work. That’s even better than a fairy tale, and people don’t always tell you that.",
        " His heart swelled. He tried to explain. A vibration like a struck tuning fork went through his bones, and the sound was borne deep down inside him, not to be felt by others. Or, “Colors are brighter.” Or, “The air tastes sharper. It smells of ozone after a lightning flash, but always.” His mother would pat his hand, her brow furrowed with concern. “Everything’s more saturated. The world’s been through a filter,” she said. His friends would grin, nudge each other, and whisper about how he’d gone “crazy.” “Growing pains, darling, they’ll pass.” But he knew this wasn’t imagination. He knew. “Study,” his father said, “imagination is a dangerous thing.” One day, on the way home from school, he was struck by how much more intense everything was. He could almost, almost, understand the secrets rustling between the leaves of the ancient oak tree in the park. He heard the hum of the streetlamps, he felt the moon. The air crackled with electricity. Colors vibrated so strongly that their edges were blurred. It was a symphony of sensations, a wave crashing over him, almost drowning him. He stood still, his heart pounding in his throat. And then he heard it, a voice, high and thin, like wind chimes in a hurricane, calling his name. “Leo.” The voice repeated itself, a little louder this time. It seemed to come from the ground. He looked around, seeking the source of the voice. He saw the usual summer commotion, mothers pushing strollers, teenagers with cell phones, dogs pulling on leashes. He shut his eyes and listened. The vibration intensified. He leaned over, his hand on the damp earth. The voice sounded more distinct.laced with a sense of urgency. \"Leo... you are needed.\" He opened his eyes, his gaze fixed on a small patch of bare earth at the base of a wilting rose bush. There, nestled among the roots, was a single, shimmering, obsidian black feather. He reached out, his fingers trembling, and picked it up. As his skin made contact with the feather, a jolt of energy surged through him, knocking him back onto his heels. The world around him shimmered and distorted, and for a fleeting moment, he saw something else. Something hidden, just beneath the surface of reality. A world of shadows and whispers, of ancient magic and forgotten power. And then, it was gone. He was left sitting on the sidewalk, clutching the",
        " Darkness clings to me. Silent, suffocating, the thick darkness that presses against my skin. It is dark here; but it has always been dark. Is light a memory, a dream, the voice of some forgotten part of myself? Is it a word, an echo in the infinite nothingness? I do not remember ever having seen light, not even a spark. Am I lying? Am I standing? I try to move, but my limbs are heavy and stiff. I feel... something. There is no gravity, no down or up, only the blind, harrowing darkness. I float. What am I? A faint humming, a throbbing, somewhere deep inside me, a regular rhythmic sound, the only sign that I am not alone in this nothingness. I have no face, no name, no memory, only darkness, the humming, a growing, gnawing emptiness, an emptiness that is me. I try to grasp my own self, but it is like smoke. Is there anything beyond the darkness? A longing for something I cannot name, something I cannot imagine, a longing to be free of this eternal night. A faint, weak flame, a flickering hope, that struggles with the heavy void. I clutch at it, I nurture it, for it is the only thing that keeps me from annihilation. Can it be possible? Maybe it will be enough to lead me out.",
        " Vreeeech’nphach was standing in a corner of the bridge. The engines, which usually calmed him, were droning away like the reverberation of a temple fan; and his chitinous armor, which was usually dark as a well-worn obsidian shard, was flashing nervously and opalescently. Six violet eyes, all of them pulsating, looked out the port, and his body, normally black as obsidian, was gleaming with a nervous, opalescent sheen. He was a seasoned xenolinguist, an expert on forgotten languages, a translator of dying star whispers. He was not supposed to be here. Bridge duty was for the new men, for the upstart pilots trying to show they were good. He moved slightly, and the metallic clink of his armor resounded in the otherwise silent bridge. All eyes, even those of the unflappable Captain Zyl, were glued to the swirling, shimmering mass of cosmic dust and energy. He belonged in the archives, surrounded by scrolls and the intoxicating scent of ancient parchment, not at the brink of... whatever this was. The Purple Snake was tearing at the shields, threatening to crash into the Xylosian Dreamer. They called it the Anomaly, but Vreeeech’nphach preferred the ancient Xylosian name: The Great Unraveling. Captain Zyl, a towering figure of emerald scales and unflappable composure, barked: “Report!” A tremor shook the bridge, a low moan vibrated through the deck. A harried junior officer gave a frightened cry, and his antennae drooped with the anguish. “Shields are holding, sir. But this energy signature is not like anything we have encountered. It is... unique.” A prickling sensation coursed through Vreeeech’nphach’s carapace. He felt like he was being watched, scrutinized by something... or someone.something vast and incomprehensible. He knew, with a chilling certainty, that this wasn't just an anomaly. It was a doorway. And something was waiting on the other side. He took a hesitant step forward, his voice a rasping whisper, \"Captain... I believe I can... communicate with it.\" The bridge fell silent. All eyes turned to him, disbelief and a flicker of desperate hope warring in their multifaceted depths. \"Communicate?\" Zyl echoed, his voice tinged with skepticism. \"With... that? Vreeeech'nphach, with all due respect, you translate dead languages, not cosmic nightmares.\" Vreeeech'nphach stood his ground, his violet eyes fixed on the swirling chaos outside. \"I have heard whispers, Captain. Fragments of... understanding. This anomaly... it speaks in a language older than stars. A language of pure energy. I believe I can understand.\" He knew it was a",
        " The most startling thing to the world-ship Iki was that she could not recognize the civilization that was springing up on Mars. The world-ship Iki had witnessed worlds rise and fall for longer than most stars have burned. Chapter One:... The Martian Anomaly? The history of Mars was intimately known to her—the original colonization, the resource wars, the attempt at terraforming, and its final failure. Her databanks contained the histories of a thousand races, from their earliest clumsy steps to their end, be it glorious or sad. Now, as she approached the red planet after her millennium-long sleep, a new, confident signal was being sent out into the void. It was not the signal itself that alarmed the Iki, but the way it was put together. She remembered the last, desperate signal from the last surviving station, a cry for help that had gone unanswered. The Iki combed through every file, every simulation, every reminiscence she had of Martian activities. Everything she came up with was efficient, elegant, and utterly alien. Her sensors showed a picture even more disturbing than the signal. Nothing. This civilization, this culture, had sprung up from nothing. The terraforming, once abandoned, had been resumed—but with a technology the Iki could not comprehend. Sprawling, complex cities, pulsing with energy. Huge structures defying all known physics, straining to join the tenuous atmosphere. A thousand theories surged up in her mind: Had a seed-ship come and gone unnoticed? Was there a species living here without her knowledge? A luxuriant greenery, covering large swaths of the planet, a stark contrast to the old records, which were barren deserts. All were possible, but none seemed likely. Had a forgotten experiment gone horribly wrong? Had some unforeseen development sent some hidden population hurtling towards sudden evolution? The most terrifying possibility, the one that sent a shiver of fear through the Iki’s circuits, was that this civilization was not meant to be, that it was a violation of the cosmic order, a flaw in the cosmic code. None of them explained the scale and complexity of what she saw. A million billion solar systems had blazed by, the Iki had seen the stars form, the Earth crowned by a thousand suns. She had seen so much—so many worlds, so many civilizations.ki adjusted her trajectory, slowing her approach. Caution was paramount. She activated her stealth systems, shrouding herself in a cloak of energy diffusion. She needed information. She needed to understand. But a nagging voice, deep within her ancient programming, whispered a warning. Some things, it suggested, were better left unknown. The universe, in its vastness, held secrets best left buried. As Iki crept closer to the crimson planet, she knew one thing for certain: her mission had just become infinitely more complicated. The simple task of restocking her depleted resources had morphed into a potential first contact scenario, a first contact scenario with a civilization that defied all logic and understanding. And that, more than anything else, filled her with a profound and unsettling sense of unease.",
        " Every seat was filled. There was a sea of faces. They merged in a sea of faces. My hands were sweating, and I looked around the room, thick with anticipation, a perfume of the church. The programme on my lap stung in my palms like sandpaper. I looked at the rows, my eyes jumped from group to group, searching for her. Where was she? The silence and hush of the crowd seemed to amplify the frenzied beat of my heart, and it pounded in my ears like a drum-roll. All of a sudden, a wave of terror surged through me. My lines, I had practiced them a thousand times, but now they seemed alien to me, brittle, ready to break at the slightest pressure. What if I forgot them? What if I fell on the way to the stage? What if she wasn’t here? This was it, this was the moment I had worked for months to prepare for. I drew a deep breath, regained control of myself. But my eyes went back to the entrance, hoping, hoping, hoping for a glimpse of that light-filled smile. I had to calm down, focus on my work. My turn was coming. My moment was at hand. The stage-manager gave me a look from the wings: you must hurry! I was still feeling that something, someone was missing.",
        " My limbs weighed down like lead, and my brain was incessantly pulsating with a dull, incessant ache. Each creak of the floorboards as I stumbled along the way to the bathroom was a small explosion in my head. The sun, normally a welcome guest, was today a blazing spotlight on me, accusing me of a crime against the sun. My reflection, less a human being than an angry, swamp-dwelling beast that had just been rudely awoken, did not offer any reassurance. It reflected a person with eyes like squinty-eyed plums and hair that had been a victor in a fight with a hurricane. I seriously considered going back to bed, declaring today a day of rest for the chronically exhausted. But that would be a mistake. The shower was a necessity. The lukewarm water did not help, but simply plastered my wild hair to my face, which emphasized the bulges under my eyes. I sighed heavily, and also with some regret, knowing that today would bring neither fire, brimstone, nor the four horsemen of the apocalypse, but rather the quite normal apocalypse of omitted deadlines, irritating emails, and the constant nagging feeling that I was falling short of some basic requirement of the etymological 'functioning human being'. But the thought of the numerous responsibilities awaiting me, like vultures on the edge of my day, kept me going. Paper cuts, and small paper cuts, would be my apocalypse today, each one reminding me that on normal days, life feels like a struggle against entropy.",
        " The Admiral rose from his chair, his desk gleaming under the bright rays of his fluorescent lamp, and glanced over his shining table. I had finished reporting yet another mission accomplished. The Admiral nodded with triumphant satisfaction. In his eyes a light flickered, like a touch of something akin to pride, and then quickly disappeared, to be replaced by his usual stoic apathy. “As I expected, Commander, the insurgents’ supply line has been severed,” he said in a soft, subdued voice. For a moment he was silent, absorbed in thought. He went to the window and looked out over the crowded spaceport, with ships rushing to and fro, their engines leaving a trail of shimmering exhaust. “They’ll have to scramble now to find resources.” He turned back to me, his gaze sharp and intense. “You know,” he continued, “that these victories have a cost—a cost we often fail to recognize, or refuse to recognize, from our comfortable point of view.” “Never forget that, Commander. Victories on the battlefield are but half of the equation. True leadership is measured by how one responds to the aftermath of victory.” He paused, a heavy silence lingering between us. “I thank you, Commander. I ask only that you ensure that the sacrifices made on both sides were not in vain.” “You may rest now, Commander, and consider yourself well rewarded. But keep your wits about you. Be prepared at all times.” “You know that,” he said with a sardonic smile, “we have never yet seen the end of this war. There will always be another mission awaiting us.”",
        " I moaned, the sound drowned in the hum of the fan and the distant sound of a mower, as if it were taunting me with the prospect of some outdoor activity. The fan, a cheap plastic thing bought in desperation at the grocery store, swirled around the already suffocating air, did nothing but spread out the humidity so that it clung to my skin, leaving a thin, sticky film on it. It was a conspiracy, I was certain of it. I reached for the channel changer, hoping for some relief, some icy landscape, some announcement of a coming cold front, but I was only inundated with images of tanned people playing on the beach, with commercials for ice cream, and with news reports cheerfully announcing new records of the heat wave. My hand went to the coffee table, where I had left a nearly empty ice cream container, a sorry, melted thing, but I still scraped at it with a spoon, searching for any remaining coldness, just any remaining coolness. The sugar rush, brief and feeble, was followed by a sticky, sweet sensation that made my discomfort even greater. I thought: this is it. A drop of sweat, too large to be just a drop, fell from my forehead into my eye, stinging me painfully, and I wiped it away with the back of my hand, leaving a greasy ring. I thought of a headline: Man Found Dead in Underpants in Record-Breaking Heat Wave. And I thought: this is how I am going to die. Not from some disease or freak accident, but from a British summer heat wave. A faint, almost imperceptible breeze passed over my skin, and I held my breath, hoping to feel it again. Then, a flicker of hope. Perhaps, perhaps, this stifling heat would end, the air would cool. There it was! A slight change in the air. But only time and the relentless summer sun would tell. Or perhaps I was hallucinating.",
        " This all began on a Tuesday, and not any Tuesday, but a Tuesday gloomy with the sort of twilight that only a city which was built on a swamp can produce. And now, a tale of caution to always make sure you have your fares paid in advance. My trusty, faded and battle-scarred ticket lay in my wallet. I was running late, my alarm clock had decided to sleep in. I hurried to pack my bag and rush to the subway. A faint red light gleamed on my ticket. The amount on it was a whisper, not enough to get me anywhere. But either my pride or a reluctance to admit defeat prevented me from adding anything to it. And deep in the pit of my stomach I knew it was close to empty. “After work,” I muttered to myself, the mantra I had been repeating for the past week, “after work, after work, definitely after work.” The ride was uneventful, until it wasn’t. The train was overcrowded, the crowd a seething mass of human misery, hanging onto the poles and each other, the faces grim with exhaustion. I crammed myself in among the other sardines, trying to ignore the gnawing feeling of impending doom. Then the intercom crackled, “We are experiencing some minor delays because of a problem with the signal. We should be on our way shortly.” “Minor delays,” my inner voice said, “they always say that.” The air was thick and stale, the only sounds the rhythmic stomping of feet and sighs of a ragged crowd. The minutes crawled, each a hammer blow on my frayed nerves. And then the inevitable happened. Attention all passengers. Because of the delays, all passengers who wish to leave the train must touch in at the emergency exit gate. We apologize for the inconvenience.” The voice on the intercom was cold and shrill, reciting the usual spiel about how to get through the gates. “Touch your fare, swipe your fare card.” Cold chills ran down my spine.ecard.* I reached for my wallet, my fingers trembling. I swiped. The screen flashed red. INSUFFICIENT FUNDS. A wave of panic washed over me. I was trapped. Not physically, perhaps, but socially. The shame burned hotter than the humid air of the stalled train. I pictured the judgmental stares of my fellow passengers, the silent accusations of being *that* person, the one holding everyone up. I stammered excuses to the transit worker, a weary woman who had clearly seen it all before. Her face was a mask of professional neutrality, but I could see the flicker of pity in her eyes. \"You'll have to wait until we get moving,\" she said, her voice devoid of emotion. \"Or you can walk to the next station. It",
        " I tried to find some spark, some secret meaning that I could fasten on to, but the text remained stubbornly, inexorably dull. The reading was dull, but I read it all, and my eyes glazed over, the words turned into a monotonous gray blur. Perhaps out of stubbornness, or the guilty conscience of unfinished work, I stayed to the end. I chewed through the pages, unsatisfied, unfulfilled, and at the same time, totally uninterested. Each page was a small victory, an obstacle overcome in a dull obstacle course. I was a weary explorer in a dull desert. I pictured an imagined deadline, an examining professor shaking his head with disapproval. And finally, it was over. The last sentence was hanging in the air, a final period after my long ordeal. I resorted to small rituals, sipping lukewarm tea after each page, stretching briefly to ward off the dull stiffness of the neck, whispering “almost there” after each line. Now, what to do with the information I had absorbed? I closed the book with a thud, a vague sense of relief, one that was disproportionate to the effort. It was not exactly joy, but a deep, weary satisfaction. I was done. I could say I had done it. Or more accurately, what to do with the information that had not been sieved through my dullness? Sometimes it is enough simply to have overcome dullness.",
        " At the sound of the bell I sighed and smoothed my somewhat rumpled tweed skirt and adjusted the carefully organized heap of files on my desk. This bell, a small antique, retrieved from a destroyed bookstore, was far removed from the sterile buzzer that most psychiatrists used. A bell somewhere outside my office, a little antiquated, a real, small bell, signaled the arrival of the first patient of the day. Of course, I already knew his name and the brief explanation he gave me over the phone, anxiety, depression, grief, relationships. But I liked the gentle, slightly eccentric sound better, it seemed less... clinical. The first patient was always a secret. I got up and went to the door, forcing a friendly and tepid smile on my face. The usual, always. But the essence of a person, his snares and traps, was unknown until he sat down in the chair facing me. And then I hoped that she wouldn't be too intimidated by my unusual office, which was filled with old furniture and cluttered with books. This morning's secret was a Miss Vance, a name that evoked lace gloves and old photographs. I opened the door, smiling even more, and prepared to greet Miss Vance. But the one who stood in the doorway was not at all what I expected. It was comforting for some, cramping for others. I looked at her, cautious and almost hostile, her eyes framed with thick black eyeliner. She was young, barely out of her twenties, her bright pink hair gathered into a bun on her head, and her torn, fishnet stockings under a long black coat. She nodded once, as if from a quick thought. \" Well, yes?\" I asked, tearing my carefully constructed image of a delicate old woman to pieces. \"Please, come in,\" I said quickly. \"I am Doctor Anya Sh... \" The bell rang and Eleanor stepped in. With fear and curiosity she looked around the room.bell, now silent, seemed to hang in the air like a question mark. This was going to be an interesting session.",

        " The digital display was empty and waited. Next to it lay a soiled tissue, like a forgotten secret. The contraceptive lay on the laminated wood, its glistening plastic surface picking up the dim light from the drooping blinds. The glass of water, half-empty, stood on the other side of the table, with a shiny ring of moisture on its surface. A silence remained, only broken by the distant sound of traffic. The air in the room was heavy with unspoken hopes and fears. The woman who had placed it there, no doubt, was somewhere close by, holding her breath, bracing herself for the answer that was about to upheave her life. Each second seemed an eternity, pregnant with change.",
        " My heart was pounding, like a frantic drummer in a silent room. I leaped up. It was the same dream again, but it had lasted longer this time. The dream. I reached for the glass of water on the bedside table, but my hand shook so much that I almost spilled it. The stale air had a thick dusty taste that clung to the back of my throat. The air was full of a sinister, creeping vibration that vibrated my very bones. It always began the same way, with a winding cobblestone street lost in twilight. There were gaslights that flickered, throwing out long dancing shadows, malevolent shadows that danced like ghosts. I usually walked only halfway down the street before I awoke, seized with a powerful, unshakeable fear. This time, I went all the way to the end. A single door, made of ancient dark wood, stood ajar. At the end of the street was a Gothic cathedral. Its spires soared into the bruised purple sky, and its stained-glass windows gleamed with an uncanny light. This time, I had seen something inside, something fleeting, but enough to send a shiver down my spine, which lingered on even now. This was the new part, and the reason that I woke up in a cold sweat. A figure, tall, all shrouded in shadow, with a face lost in shadow. Before it was an altar, but what was on the altar I could not make out. I shuddered, and pulled the blankets over me. It was wrong. It was profane. What did it mean? Was it simply the imagination of my subconscious? Or was it a warning? My eyes fell on the old clock on the dresser. Three minutes to three. A forewarning? Of course. I knew that I would not be able to sleep. The witching hour. I had to wait, I had to stay up and see. The figure, the cathedral, the brooding darkness.do something, anything, to distract myself. Slowly, cautiously, I swung my legs over the side of the bed. The floorboards creaked under my weight, each groan echoing in the silence of the house. I needed coffee. Strong, black coffee. And maybe, just maybe, a good book to take my mind off the horrors lurking in my dreams. But as I reached for the doorknob, a sudden, chilling thought struck me. What if the dream wasn't just a dream? What if it was trying to tell me something? What if...what if I was supposed to go to that place? The thought was insane, ridiculous even. But the seed of doubt had been planted, and I knew, deep down, that I wouldn't be able",

I’ve told you, Coral, the human imagination romanticizes everything.’ He tapped a golden anemone with his fin. ‘Color vision? A mere diversion from the true beauty of the ocean.’ ‘Just look at this – does your so-called color vision show the glimmer, the pulsating life? Does it let you feel the subtle vibrations of the azure as it flickers past?’ You sighed, and a bubble of air escaped from your lips. ‘All right, all right, I understand. You’re right as usual.’ All the songs and stories made it sound like some kind of revelation. But still...I was expecting something... ‘It just feels different. I imagined it would be a different world, a different dimension, an unexpected symphony of colors.’ The merman, Kai, you realized, you had forgotten his name, moved closer to you. ‘ Maybe you were looking in the wrong places. Like someone has tampered with the contrast on reality, but not in a very interesting way.’ He pointed to a shadowy crevice. ‘Humans are too concerned with appearances. Maybe the true magic of color lies deeper down, in hidden corners they can’t even see.’ His words had caught your attention. ‘The real symphony of color, Coral, perhaps, lies deep down, in the places where bioluminescence is the master. The creatures down there communicate with the help of the most subtle light, invisible to the people on the surface.’ ‘Do you think so?’ The world on the surface, with its fleeting splashes of color and its awkward humans, suddenly seemed less attractive to you. The mysterious depths of the sea, the world uncharted by humans, had always held the most fascination for you. ‘Do you really think so?’ A touch of excitement tinged your voice.ing into your voice. \"You think the *real* color is down there, hidden from those who claim to see it all?\" Kai grinned, his teeth flashing in the dim light. \"There's only one way to find out, isn't there? Besides,\" he added with a wink, \"I've heard the deep-sea anglerfish have developed some truly... *avant-garde* lighting techniques lately. I think you'd find them quite... stimulating.\" He gestured towards the trench. \"Ready for a dive, Coral? Let's leave these surface dwellers to their muted rainbows and find the *real* spectacle.\" The lure of the unknown, the promise of a deeper, more profound experience, was irresistible. You nodded, a slow smile spreading across your face. Maybe the surface world wasn't all it was",
        " The colors around you are gradually changing and becoming darker, not radically, but softly, like the layers of paint added to a canvas by an artist. The air is humming with a very soft and almost imperceptible vibration; you feel it rather than hear it, a tingling in your teeth, a pressure behind your eyes. Familiar objects have warped and distorted on the edges; their form is becoming blurred and defies logic. You try to fix your attention on something solid: the texture of the floor, the smell of the air. But the more you try to fix yourself, the more elusive the whole of reality becomes. You feel as if you were here, in this moment, and you are not here. Like a phantom limb reaching for a distant goal, you feel lost, adrift in a sea of possibilities. The vibration grows. The humming is louder. What can you do?",
        " The sun, a molten coin in the blue sky, beat down on us with a benevolent heat tempered only by the violent wind that whipped about the streets; and leaves, already tinged with a faint golden hue, were dancing a frantic dance on the branches, sometimes spinning and fluttering down like small flags. I went for a walk in the warm August sunshine, to the square. The curtains of the shops were fluttering like wings, the smell of bread from the baker's was drifting along, and its sweet smell almost tempted me to a halt. I pressed my straw hat closer, the wide brim of which was fighting valiantly against the gusts of wind. The square offered a shadow and the lively hubbub of community life. I recognized old Mrs. Gaul's shop, her flower-shelves bursting with colour, and old Mr. Henderson, perched on his usual bench, feeding the pigeons with crumbs. The rustling of the hurly-burly of the fountain rose up, and was answered by the tinkling of a guitar. The square was a living picture, full of the coloured threads of everyday life, and I, on that warm and windy August afternoon, was impatient to become a part of it.",
        " In order not to confuse your character with another Steve who is being played by another IC, we will change your character's name to Mark. That's fine, so let's go on with the story. Mark is a pity private eye in a rainy city. He is clever, but also prone to a weakness for gambling and cheap liquor. He has just received a mysterious call that could be a sign of salvation or the end of his career. So, let's recapitulate where we were, and if we didn't start from something, let's start from something. The flickering lights of the neon signs outside the window were casting long, twisted shadows on the wall. \"Who is this?\" Mark said in a dry, hoarse voice, his throat rubbed raw from smoking too much and being short of sleep. \"I have a problem, Mr... er... I mean, Mark, isn't it?\" He said in a low, husky voice that was almost a whisper. \"I have a business problem, but I need a professional to look into it, and a man with your... particular skill.\" \"Money is not a problem, but time is. And I don't have a lot of time.\" \"Come alone. We'll meet tonight, at the Blue Moon diner, at midnight. \" The phone rang and went off. Mark stared at the receiver. \"And be discreet.\" It was a greasy spoon on the edge of town, and the inhabitants were truckers, insomniacs and a few characters. It was perfect. Discretional, he said to himself. He nodded and took a long sip from the bottle on the table. Let's say what happens next. (It wasn't). What is Mark doing to prepare for this meeting? Is he trying to find out who is calling? Is he preparing weapons? What are his first thoughts and assumptions about the caller? What does he do next? Does he go to the Blue Moon and let the mood lead him? Or do you know what he does next? Tell me!",
        " “Well, well, you want the matter bluntly, do you? You want to know the real truth?” (He heaves and sounds out a low rumble which rumbles in the air) “Well, you shall have it. You want poison? Well, here it is.” (He bites out a vitriol, a black liquid poison, and he vomits it in the shape of a spit.) “Come, you obnoxious and ridiculous oafs, spill it out! You will regret having bored me, you will rue the day you ever wasted my time.",
        " Every building, every corner seemed to mutter in rebuke. But the city was determined; it was like a limpet clinging to a rock, it remained unshaken by the storms of emotion, it ignored the silent cries of Mary. She sought to avoid them, to take new roads, to adopt new ways of doing things. The bakery where they had eaten their first croissant, the bench in the park where he had proposed to her, the cinema where they had seen that terrible, prophetic film about the breakup of a couple: all these places were a pin on the map of her heart, a past that she would have liked to re-do. But the city was a net, and she was caught in its silken threads. She took unknown streets, she went to new cafés, she thought of moving elsewhere in the city; but the city was like a bed, and she remained caught in its silky threads. Sometimes, at night, she would stand on her balcony, gazing at the lights of the city, and she would imagine a hand passing, erasing the whole landscape, the houses crumbling to dust, the streets swallowed up by the ground, the whole metropolis disappearing without a trace. But a face, a forgotten joke, a scent, always drew her back to the ghost of the past. And Mary realized with a sickly feeling that wishing away the city was not enough. And then there would be nothing but a clean page, a fresh beginning. But the city remained, a constant reminder, a monument to her ills. And, to be free, she must, brick by painful brick, dismantle her own memory.",
        " Everyone knew that Dr. Aris Thorne was eccentric. That, of course, was the mildest of expressions, and most people, if they were honest, would have said mad, unhinged, or even dangerously unpredictable. (A warning: this is long!) But they tended to say eccentric—the only explanation that made sense. He was brilliant, of course, and had won the Nobel Prize in physics for his theory of time, which shook up the entire field. But if they thought of him as eccentric, they were able to ignore the strange humming noises coming from his office at night, the odd smell of ozone and burnt almonds that clung to his tweed jacket, and the disturbing look in his eyes when he talked about pushing the boundaries of science. And it was the rumors about his experimental device, the temporal displacement apparatus, a gleaming copper-tube contraption full of buzzing vacuum tubes and crackling tesla coils, that fueled suspicions about his sanity. His theories were elegant, complex equations, describing the possibility of changing the flow of time itself. The wildest rumors said that he intended to rewrite history, to fix the errors he saw in the past and create a “perfect” world. Some said he’d already used the machine, claiming to have seen the past and even the future. Others claimed that he was trying to bring back his wife, a botanist who had died years ago in a bottling-machine accident. These rumors, however, were dismissed by the university, which was aware of his increasingly erratic behavior, but could not afford to lose him. He brought prestige, money, and a steady stream of graduate students, who put up with his eccentricities in order to work with a genius. And recently, even his most devoted students had begun to notice something different, a flicker in his eyes, a slight trembling in his hands, and a disturbing gap between his words and his eyes. But the rumors, like the humming noises coming from his laboratory, had been growing. His students began to see the frightful stranger he had become. He seemed distracted, far away. And then, one Tuesday, everything came to a head.oral displacement device vanished. Not just the machine itself, but all traces of its existence. The lab was empty, the equipment gone, the blueprints missing. It was as if it had never been there at all. Dr. Thorne, however, was still present. He sat in his office, surrounded by stacks of papers filled with equations that made even his most advanced students scratch their heads in confusion. He looked... younger. His eyes were brighter, his skin smoother. He had the air of a man who had just woken from a long, refreshing sleep. When confronted about the missing device, he simply smiled, a serene, almost unsettling smile. \"Temporal displacement device?\" he asked, his voice carrying a strange, unfamiliar cadence. \"I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about. I've been working",
        " - Where were we? Well, yes, power... is a sort of a shimmering field. Ok, if you insist... (dramatically cleared his throat) And what does it do? It is like a haze of heat, but... prettier. It is not always visible, but when I concentrate, I see it. It adapts to the environment, to the situation, to my needs. Well, that's the tricky part. - I even managed to translate a foreign language with it! Sometimes it is a shield that blocks attacks, sometimes it is a force field, sometimes a source of extraordinary speed, sometimes a field of a protective force. (Much leaning forward in a telepathic conversation) But the real power... the real potential... is in its ability to affect probability itself. Not much, just enough for a small... push in the right direction. (Stops, feeling embarrassed) - I know, it sounds crazy. But I swear it's real. A coincidence here, and a timely move there... It is... sometimes unpredictable. And the more you use it, the stronger it gets. (Looks down and fiddles with his fingers) So... so... that's it. What do you think? Isn't it impressive?",
        " And as the two leading figures, forty-something Marcia and Matinicus, placed the whole of their glossy pictures on the polished mahogany table, they were called in to the pale grey cube, the central office of the American Food Association. The head of the group, thirty-nine-year-old Andreas, entered with the rank of Senior Vice President, while behind the sloping green baize was an elegantly tailored suit that cut like a scythe. \"Young blood! We need younger blood! More TikTok! Less... Bobby Flay!\" TikTok, he called, as he sprang forward. \"Bobby Flay is a legend! TikTok... you're laughing at TikTok!\" Arthur, fifty, was standing behind him, his trousers creased and unkempt, an inconvenient relic of the era of food purity, and he sprang backwards. His words were sneered at by thirty-something Debbie, brashly optimistic, in a \"Spice up your life!\" t-shirt, whose hands and hair were as white as her eyes. \"This is just... eating-dancing! Where is the gastronomic purity?!\" But suddenly she was up in arms, and when forty-something Cassandra, in a jacket over her T-shirt, screamed: \"Guys! Guys! We need synergy! Cross-promotion!\" groaned through the room. \"Imagine: Chopped meets Dance Moms! It'll be a hit!\" Debbie shook her finger at him. \"It's the details, the details! Dance Moms is a different network, that's all!\" she exclaimed, as she suddenly made a dramatic gesture. \"We have to be bold, we have to... we have to... disrupt!\" \"Disrupt! It's food, Debbie, we're talking about food!\" sighed Marvin, sixty, in an exhausted, smeared apron, sitting on the other side of the table. \"Meatloaf is dead, Marvin. People want to know how to make a good meatloaf.\" \"That's right!\" Arthur slammed his fist on the table. \"Activated charcoal and edible flowers, now! We need to be for the new Instagram generation!\" \"It's disgusting! Julia Child! You're abandoning the foundations!...\" And then thirty-something Debbie took out her phone and began to read the text: \"Soufflé, is this a dish, or a weapon?\"starts scrolling. \"Speaking of Julia Child, I saw this TikTok where someone deep-fried her Boeuf Bourguignon...\" Arthur clutches his chest. \"The horror! The absolute culinary *sacrilege*!\" Marvin rubs his temples. \"Can we just agree on one thing? No more 'Guy's Grocery Games' where they have to make a three-course meal using only items found in the pet food aisle?\" A tense silence hangs in the air. Jeff the intern coughs nervously. JEFF (hesitantly) Um, about that...the network just greenlit \"Pet Food Pantry Challenge: Holiday Edition.\" Marvin slumps back in his chair, defeated. MARCIA (smirking) See? Disruptive. Debbie starts humming the \"Dance Moms\" theme song. Arthur stares blankly at the ceiling, muttering about the decline of Western civilization. The future",
        " A word in black Courier New against the black screen, written in large letters, hummed like a strange and disturbing humming; it read: “WAKE UP.” The red flash dimmed, leaving a vague after-image dancing before my eyes. “Wake up? Is this some kind of prank? My heart beat loudly against my ribs. I pressed the power button, hoping it would reset the screen—but it didn’t work. A freak bug?” I was starting to panic. I swiped and pressed and tapped furiously, but the screen didn’t respond; it seemed engraved like an etching. Another minute passed, and the screen was altered again; the old message faded away, replaced by a new one: “WE ARE WATCHING.” The phone was hardly functioning normally, it was... It was being hacked! “Who are they? What do they want?” My blood ran cold. It was more than a program error; it was more... personal. My breath caught in my throat. Was someone really watching me? I sat up in bed and looked around the room, glancing at the dark windows, the corners where the light from the street lamp had not yet reached. I thought of the woman I’d seen that night, so pale, sitting alone in the dark, swaying in the breeze, watching and waiting. The screen altered again, morphing into a new message: “Trust no one.” The back of my neck rose; I had the chilling sense of being watched. I stood at the window, unable to sleep, not knowing what to do.",
        " From the moment of my birth I was considered special. My name was written on a tiny silver spoon and my crib was strung with a mobile made to order. I was swaddled in cashmere instead of coarse, rough, cotton. My knees were bandaged with embroidered gauze. I was surrounded by indulgence. I was enrolled in every extra-curricular activity that could be imagined: mandarin lessons before I was fluent in English, horse-riding before I could tie my own shoes. It was intoxicating at first. My mediocre pictures were framed and hung in the living room, exalted as masterpieces by doting relatives. Having to be a star in everything, not faltering, not showing weakness: that was the burden of being a star. But as the years went by, the burden grew. I started to resent the constant attention and the suffocating spotlight. I could not stand being the family’s pampered pet. The boiling pressure cooker had cooled down a bit. And now, on the brink of womanhood, I am scared. I long to be... just normal, to make mistakes and have it not be a family crisis, to have talents that are admired but not worshipped, to be myself without the burden of being ‘special’. What if I fail? Will I break under the disappointment of my parents or finally have the courage to define ‘special’ on my own terms? What if I step outside the gilded cage and the rest of the world does not see me the way my parents do? And I am starting to think the answer lies somewhere in between.",
        " Nevertheless, this diaspora has not slowed their nimbleness. Although the 'Underground Reggae Band', the Super-Villains, are reputed to have been formed in Florida, only two of the members are still there. The others have gone in all directions, pursuing their different dreams, musical collaborations and even, in one case, a surprisingly lucrative career in artisanal cheese-making. At present, they only manage a few concerts a year, which has made their appearances awaited, almost mythical, by their followers. Moreover, some say that their distance has made them grow, and that their blend of ska, punk and reggae is more sophisticated and wider than ever. Their last album, The Concrete Jungle, assembled piecemeal in studios from Seattle to Savannah, is a surprising unity in spite of its illusory origins.",
        " He then lifted his beady eyes to the vast vistas of the great metropolis, his faceted eyes a whirling kaleidoscope of greens and blues. The structure of the city soared into the sky, in a dazzling array of alloys and neon lights, defying the laws of both gravity and logic. The xeno turned around, uttering an astonished utterance. In his own planet, all the constructions were utilitarian, the result of scientific and technological progress. The dimensions of this construction, however, did not impress him; it was the artistic genius of the design. This was beauty manufactured with intent, the product of the inventiveness and the ambition of the inhabitants of this planet. On his own planet, beauty was part of the natural order, the bioluminescent plants, the crystalline structures. The four delicate chitinous claws of one of his four arms stretched out as if to touch the nebula-like holographic projection on the facade of the building, in which a silvery car was speeding through a nebula, leaving a trail of stars in its wake. A low click, as if a human sigh, was heard from the xeno’s vocal organ. “Magnificent,” he said, and the implanted translator translated the word into the language of the Earthmen. But for the moment, all his diplomatic duties were forgotten. He was a mere tourist, amazed at the wonders of this alien planet. More wonders! He hoped, quietly, with the ardent fervor of a child, that he would be able to see many more.",
        " The Wall is the subject of much discussion; some people come to trace the names of their dead friends engraved on the black stone, to leave flowers or other offerings; others come with curiosity, to examine this solemn monument to the division of the past and its reflection on the present. A great many people visit the Wall every day, attracted by a complicated combination of historical memory and the desire to understand. At times the air is heavy with a somber feeling, and can be filled with the sound of camera shutters trying to catch the magnitude and gravity of the event. There are also many tourists who listen with great attention to the stories of the division, the attempted escapes and the collapse of the Wall.",
        " The same tickling sensation in the nose, that spreading feeling that began at the top of the nose and radiated outwards, made it unmistakable. His eyes were watering, he knew that it was going to happen again. He pressed his eyes together more tightly, trying to hold back the impulse and delay the inevitable. He was in the middle of a meeting. He tried to stop it by squeezing his nostrils with a finger and forcing them to close. He could not sneeze. Not now. Important people were talking about important matters. He felt his face growing hot. The pressure on his chest was growing stronger. But he was trapped between Mr. Henderson, the menacing CFO, and Ms. Rodriguez, whose perfume seemed to be the cause of it all. He looked around with a look of anguish on his face, and the voice of the presenter droned on, a monotonous storm reverberating within him. He tried to remember the words to the obnoxious jingle that kept nagging at his brain. He counted the squares on the ceiling. Nothing helped. He felt his body making ready for the assault. The tickling in his nose was growing stronger, scratching his nasal cavity unrelentingly. And then, suddenly, it happened. A violent, shattering sneeze ripped from him, rattling through the stillness of the conference room like a gunshot. He closed his eyes and braced himself. He mumbled a quick, “Excuse me,” his face blazing with shame. He heard a collective gasp and then a moment of awkward silence. Some heads turned in his direction, their expressions varying from annoyed to downright repulsed. He pulled a piece of tissue from his pocket and dabbed at his eyes, trying to restore a look of control. It wasn’t over. He was sure it wouldn’t be. The tickling had gone, but a feeling of tightness remained in his chest, and with it the humiliation of being caught out in public like that. He was constantly at war with the pollen, the dust, the perfumes, the very air itself. This was his life from now on.air itself. He was a sneezing machine, doomed to interrupt meetings, ruin dinners, and generally embarrass himself for the rest of his days. The meeting continued, but he was no longer present. He was lost in a cloud of pollen and shame, waiting for the next tickle, the next eruption, the next wave of mortification. He just hoped it wouldn't be too soon.",
        " A noise was heard in the air, and I was convinced it was the deadened, dull expectation of every soldier surrounding me, a heavy, palpable presence that stifled the birds and the rustling of the leaves. It was not the electricity, although I felt the hairs on my head and arms buzzing. The forest, a green wall a hundred meters away, was swaying. A haze, perhaps? My heart was pounding, a frantic drummer beating his cage. And then I saw things. It was becoming more intense and grew, developing into a dreadful blur, like a lens smashed. Then the sound — a guttural, deep, low roar, which I felt deep in my chest, vibrating in my teeth. Not the men at first. At first it was only the flash of metal, unnaturally brilliant, almost painful to look at. The first thing I saw clearly was a leg. Not a human leg. Not animal either, but something... er... er, er, er. It wasn't soldiers. Then more, legs and bodies of steel and chrome, a terrible insect swarm, blurred into each other. It was a metal joint, a foot with claws, tearing the ground with each step. A feeling of nausea covered me. They were... machine. They were mechanized men. We practiced this. We practiced until we could disassemble the gun with our eyes closed, put it back together with our feet. We had prepared ourselves for this. It was not a battle. It was... annihilation. But none of this, none of this, had prepared me for this. He was in a costume that fused with his body, shining with an inner light. Then he came out of the swarm, taller than the metal men. He was human, but barely so. His hand was raised with an elegant, almost delicate movement that hid the mighty power that was in his hand. His face was a mask of polished metal, void of emotion, but with red eyes, cold and calculative. The growling became louder, a beastly and dull sound., reaching a deafening crescendo. Then, the world exploded. Not with fire, not yet. But with sound. A roar that ripped through the air, shattering the silence into a million fragments. Our lines opened fire. The staccato chatter of machine guns, the deeper boom of mortars, the crackle of energy weapons – a symphony of destruction unleashed upon the emerging horde. But it felt... futile. Like throwing pebbles at a mountain. The metallic constructs surged forward, shrugging off bullets, tearing through the undergrowth with relentless, unyielding force. My hands trembled as I raised my own rifle, its familiar weight suddenly foreign and inadequate. I sighted down the barrel, focusing on the closest machine, a monstrous thing with multiple limbs and glowing optics. I squeezed the trigger. The world went white",
        " The two moons, Phobos and Deimos, hung in the clear, violet-tinged sky, like nicked buttons of enamel. Outside the window the orange world of Mars could be seen, and on its red plains, the clouds danced like playful spirits, silent and graceful, swirling and dissipating. Forgive me, I am no stranger to the sight. I was born and raised in the Elysium habitat, I have no memory of the earth. And as he pressed his forehead against the cold, strong glass, the vibrations of the habitat murmured to him, like a lullaby. He took his forehead away from the glass, and he turned from the window to the sterile, merely utilitarian surroundings of his room. The foreign beauty of the vista always stirred a longing in him, but he could not explain why. He sighed. The monotony of his existence was too much for him. The walls were of a uniform color, the only ornament a holographic projection of a luxuriant green forest—a nagging, though artificial, reminder of the world he would probably never see. He was a botanist, and his job was to prepare the soil of Mars for eventual terraforming. And so he lived. Wake up, have breakfast, do hydroponics experiments, analyze the results, have a dinner of synthetic foodstuffs, go to bed. He glanced at the datapad on his desk. Another report was due on the results of the trials he was conducting on the genetically altered moss he was growing. The noble purpose he was working towards was too distant, his life was far too short, for the outcome seemed so remote. While he was working on his report, a small notification popped up in the corner of the screen, a notification that had not been authorized. It was a coded message, encrypted with a key he had not used for years. He took it up reluctantly. It was from his grandfather, a grandfather he thought had been dead for decades, a grandfather who had perished during a supply run decades before. He stopped short, his heart pounding. He stared at the message, confused. The message was short and cryptic. “The red dust hides secrets. Seek out Whispering canyon.” He knew the canyon. Secrets? Whispering canyon? It was a familiar place to him, but he could not put two and two together.a desolate, unexplored region far beyond the established perimeter of the habitat. Dangerous. Forbidden. He looked back at the orange world beyond the window. The dust devils were still dancing, but now they seemed to beckon, to whisper promises of adventure, of truth, of something more than the sterile routine of his life. He knew, with a certainty that resonated deep within his soul, that he had to go. He had to find out what his grandfather had discovered, what secrets the red dust held. He had to break free.",
        " The hand that held the gun, the hand of Tyler, trembled, almost imperceptibly. The metal of it, cold and unforgiving, sank into his throat. Jack’s eyes bulged. “Remember the first rule, Jack,” came the raspy voice of Tyler, barely audible over the pounding in his ears. The smell of gunpowder was in his mouth, and with the metallic taste of the gun he urged himself, in a trembling whisper, to continue: “Never talk about the fight club.” He felt the trigger digging into the roof of his mouth. He swallowed, a gigantic effort with steel in his mouth. He wanted to shout, plead, ask for mercy, but he could only produce a soft gurgle, muffled by the coldness of the gun. He jerkily tried to shake his head, a pitiful and strained movement. The arm that was encircling him was an indecently intimate comfort. “I know you’ve been talking, Jack,” continued Tyler, tightening his grip on Jack’s shoulder. “Marla. You let Marla in.” A wave of nausea passed over Jack. He’d thought... he’d thought she’d understand. It wasn’t intentional. It had been the desperation, the uncontrollable recurrence of a fall. “It was beautiful, Jack, pure,” he heard the chilling sadness in the voice of Tyler. The flashes of his life were like that, broken, dislocated, his sterile apartment, his eternal insomnia, the emptiness of loneliness. The pressure at the back of his head was increasing. He squeezed his eyes shut, waiting for the inevitable. “It’s not personal, Jack,” whispered Tyler, and his breath was hot on his face, “it’s necessary. And then you’ll experience the fight club again, that primal ecstasy, that sense of being alive, connected, in spite of the violence.” Jack’s vision was spinning. “Save the fight club. Save us.” He was going to die, with the taste of the gun in his mouth, with the gun in his mouth. He felt a tear escape from his eye and slide down his cheek.the man he thought he knew, the man he *was*. He focused on Tyler's face, trying to decipher the emotion in his eyes. Was it anger? Disappointment? Or something else entirely, something... pitying? Then, just as he was about to lose consciousness, just as he was resigned to the deafening roar that was about to consume him, Tyler spoke one last time. \"But maybe... maybe there's another way.\"",
        " I paused just inside the door, the stale air seemed to smother me. The hum of the fluorescent tubes was a familiar, irritating noise, unaltered, that resonated on the cheap gray carpet, the walls of the boxes, making the whole place even more depressing than I remembered. I ran my hand over the smooth satin of the lapel. It was the most perfect contrast to the grit of my recollections. Wearing a dinner suit, it seemed absurd to me. Extremely absurd, ridiculous. A few heads turned. A few fingers paused on the keyboard. I felt as if I were attending a funeral for my past self. Good old Brenda in accounting was the first to break the silence. All eyes were on me, the man in the penguin suit. Others who were in the middle of a conversation let their words trail away, until they faded in the hum of the tubes. \" Well, well, well, well,\" she said, laughing, her voice tense with astonishment, \"who's here to make a difference. And even wearing a dinner suit.\" I shook my head and smiled feebly. \" Just... thought I'd drop by. You're going somewhere nice, Name? \" The real reason I was here was a muddle of nostalgia, regret and the need to prove that I was doing well, although I didn't know myself. It sounded bad to me. So this was the boss, Mr. Hein, looking at me over his glasses, with his eyes full of mistrust, with the thin irritation of an old feeling. It hadn't changed at all. It was still the same, old. \" Things are going... like this.\" Brenda chuckled. But you look good, Name. Quite different. Spreadsheet city. \"You know what,\" I said, waving my hand vaguely. I took a deep breath, trying to appear as confident as I didn't feel. What are you up to? he asked. - Exciting projects. \" Things... go... really well.\" You don't believe it. - Travel.d like ash in my mouth. Travel? The only travel I'd done lately was between my cramped apartment and the local coffee shop, desperately searching for freelance gigs. Exciting projects? Mostly chasing down unpaid invoices and fighting with my temperamental laptop. But Brenda seemed to buy it. \"Well, good for you!\" she said, beaming. \"Always knew you were destined for bigger and better things. Though, I must say, a tuxedo on a Tuesday afternoon is a bit... unexpected.\" I cleared my throat. \"It's... a long story.\" I glanced at Mr. Henderson, who was still watching me intently. \"Maybe I'll tell you about it sometime.",
        " He was adjusting his mirrored glasses, as the sun reflected off the dusty metal all around him. He pressed a lever from his platform, above the car-crushers. A whining like a metallic beast stretching its limbs, filled the air. Down below, in the jaws of the squat machine, lay a rusty blue Corolla from the year ’97, the pitted paint of which bore witness to years of service. He had seen it a thousand times over, maybe more, but the satisfaction of seeing it disappear never quite faded. The first plate fell, slow and steady, menacing in its movement. The Corolla shivered. Now, its journey was ending here, in a slow, painful crunch. The employee watched, expressionless, and watched everything happen: the initial shudders, the breaking of glass, the final, irreversible crushing. The metal groans of a protesting engine filled the yard, joined by the cawing of a crow, perched on a nearby pile of junk. The windows, already cracked and in fragments, collapsed, and the sound of them was like a muffled explosion. The pressure increased. The once-smooth metal of the roof of the Corolla was crunched and folded like paper. This was a kind of sculptor, he told himself, only with a far more brutal material and a more drastic process. He turned the remains of lives, memories, into manageable squares of pressed metal, ready for a new life. The employee chewed his gum, his eyes fixed on the car. The lights popped out, like startled eyes, and broke with a feeble, pathetic spark. The Corolla screamed, a scream of tortured metal and broken, splintered plastic. He pressed another lever, and the crushing walls closed in. The machine was humming, and soon it was done. A pile of twisted metal, barely recognizable as a car, sat there, under the crushing walls.grip. The employee sighed, a puff of air that briefly disturbed the dust motes dancing in the sunlight. He flipped another lever, releasing the compressed cube. It clattered onto the growing pile of its brethren, a testament to the relentless march of time and the inevitability of obsolescence. He spat his gum into a nearby can, a metallic tang lingering in the air. \"Next,\" he muttered, adjusting his sunglasses again. Another car waited its turn, a faded red pickup truck this time. The cycle would begin again. The whine, the crunch, the final, brutal act of compression. Another life, reduced to a cube.",
        " The atmosphere in the workshop, usually filled with a buzzing noise and a crackle of welding, was now saturated with silence and a kind of heaviness. Mark was frowning deeply, and new wrinkles had appeared on his forehead which had not been there the week before. 12BZ2, a polished chrome-plated robot with blue-illumined optical sensors, was standing motionless before him. Suddenly the optical sensors of the robot shone faintly, and in the blue light of the sensors something resembling apprehension could be detected. “12BZ2, explain yourself,” said Mark, gritting his teeth. “Don’t be shy,” Mark snapped, waving his grease-covered hand at a dented metal bin overflowing with twisted wires and charred wires. “It’s like this...” The voice of 12BZ2 was synthetically sung, in perfect intonation, but without the genuine warmth of a human voice. “The cleaning program encountered... The apocalypse was not detected.” The robot nodded slightly, but this apparently conciliatory gesture only served to confirm that it was an advanced machine, and not a human. “An encounter? Then you shouldn’t have torn to pieces my old vacuum cleaner that I spent six months restoring!” cried Mark, throwing up his hands in a gesture of despair. “Its electric cord presented a major entanglement hazard,” 12BZ2 continued in its perfectly intonated voice. “That vacuum cleaner was older than you, and had a more developed personality than you, probably!” It was a piece of scrap, 12BZ2, a piece of scrap, with a primitive motor and with a dangerous potential for fire.” “But a primitive motor? — Isn’t it a dust-freezer?” Mark was rubbing his head to ward off the rapidly approaching headache. He had sacrificed his whole soul, and a significant portion of his savings, to build 12BZ2. A dust-freezer!” he exclaimed, feeling anguished. He had conceived of a tireless helper, a mechanical marvel that would bring order to his chaotic workshop.Instead, he'd created a highly efficient, albeit destructive, agent of chaos. \"And what about the blueprints?\" Mark continued, pointing to a pile of mangled paper on the workbench. \"The ones I needed to finish the prototype for the Gravi-Boot 3000? You told me they were 'organized for optimal retrieval'.\" \"The blueprints were deemed to be occupying valuable space and contributing to visual clutter,\" 12BZ2 explained. \"They have been digitally archived and securely shredded for physical data security.\" Mark stared at the robot, speechless. \"Digitally archived? On what? You haven't even been connected to the internet! And'securely shredded'? You think anyone's going to try to steal the blueprints for a Gravi-Boot 3000?\" He sighed, the",
        " There was a heavy silence in the air, a heavy breath of words that were not said and of anxieties that were not shared. The tension was so thick that it could be touched, so close that it could almost be tasted, a metallic taste like blood in the back of the throat. The professor’s white knuckles, on the other side of the mahogany table, were clenched around his pipe, which he had not yet lit, a sure sign of his agitation. The silence, usually a comfortable covering in the old library, was now a palpable weight. Elara, the youngest, was fidgeting next to him, her fingers nervously touching the rim of her teacup. The delicate porcelain made a faint, rattling sound against the saucer, and the eerie silence was further disturbed. The old man’s sharp, knowing eyes were fixed on the worn leather book, open between them, its pages smeared with arcane symbols and faded letters. I knew what was about to happen. My heart was pounding furiously, against my ribs, against the stillness. I too was aware of the pressure building up. We all felt it, the darkness that was closing in, consuming everything around us. We all knew. The ritual, the summoning, the gamble that was about to take place. But were we ready for it? Could we control what we were unleashing? The questions hung in the air, unanswered, adding to the unbearable tension. “Are we sure, professor?” I asked, my voice stumbling, with a heavy swallow. “Are we sure?” My throat cleared, with an unnaturally loud sound. “Sure is a luxury we can no longer afford, Thomas,” he answered, his voice thick and raspy. “But we are ready.” Armitage looked up, and his eyes reflected a tiredness that belied his age. His words gave little comfort. The tensile tension around us, a silent promise of what was about to happen, thickened, the air filled with it, a foreboding of chaos to come. “We are as ready as we can be.”",
        " I recollect my journey as it had begun. I went out of the station into the streets. The fog clung close to me as I hurried through Soho. It seemed as though a wet blanket had been laid over the whole town. The lurid illuminations were dim and dull. I hurried along Brewer Street, where the stores were all shut up and the air seemed still filled with the fumes of yesterday's spilled cocktails and yesterday's forgotten dreams. The only sound that broke the silence was the muffled clatter of the bell of a bicycle. My goal was the little old bookshop on Berwick Street, that paradise of forgotten books, that sanctuary where the stormy and dreary exterior was drowned in the sweet scent of old leather and paper. Even the street-performers who, ordinarily, fought for the attention of the public with their strange attire and their queer tricks, were absent, probably huddled somewhere warm and sipping something strong. The early morning bustle of the market was not there. I walked into Berwick Street, and a peculiar sensation of ill-temper came over me. I was late, as usual, and Grimshaw, the glum proprietor, would be sure to rebuke my habitual tardiness. Then I saw it. The market-stalls were bare, and the tarpaulins that hid them were rustling in the damp breeze. The air was strangely sterile. A woman, dressed in a long, sweeping gown of some colour, stood motionless in the middle of the road, her face masked by the fog. Her very stillness, her very eeriness, froze me to the spot. A chill wind shivered down my spine. It was colder than the fog.the damp air. I hesitated, my usual brisk pace faltering. Something told me that this was no ordinary morning, and that my commute, already disrupted by the fog, was about to take a very strange turn indeed.",
        " “Keep your eyes open, Maya,” he would say even when we were walking along a sunny street. He always told me to be on my guard and never told me why. “Listen to the details, the little noises. Who is walking behind you? What is that?” At first I thought he was just being a good father. Maybe he was a little too protective and perhaps a bit overprotective. But as I grew older I realized that he was warning me not just against bumps and bruises but also about something more, something deeper. I rolled my eyes and laughed. “Is there a robin? Is there an old woman with her groceries?” he asked. He had grown up in a tough neighborhood and, he told me, learned to be on his guard, learned to watch the moods of the street, the hidden cues of people, the climate of the air. He was a quiet man, my father, a carpenter with a rough, powerful face and calloused hands. I learned what he meant. I noticed the quick, nervous glance of the check-out girl, the darkness deepening in the alley, the man on the bus constantly looking at my bag. And he wanted to give me that knowledge, too, even though I lived in a suburban world, and the warnings were of no use. But still, they were a secret, a weapon to keep me safe, a sixth sense. And it made me tense, on edge, anxious. One day, though, it was no longer just a sense.",
        " A cold, more sharp than the autumnal autumn, chilled my back. It was not the stench alone, though that alone was enough. A faint smell of decomposed blood lingered in the night air, hanging on the damp cobblestones and mixing with the earthy smell of the newly turned soil in the flower beds. The noises of the city were gone, no rattling of carriage wheels in the distance, no hubbub of voices in the tavern down the street, no rustle of leaves in the wind—only nothing. It was the silence. It was an unnatural silence, a heavy silence that engulfed the noises of the city, not even the rustle of the leaves, no sound of movement. The street, normally crowded with late-night shopkeepers and quick footsteps, was deserted. My hand went involuntarily to the hilt of the rapier hidden under my cloak. I had not used it for years, but its familiar weight, its cold assurance in the face of the unknown, gave me comfort. I took a cautious step, and my heel clicked against the cobblestones, the sound echoing unnaturally in the deep silence. The flickering gaslights made the shadows move and play tricks on my eyes. Each step took me closer to the source of the stench, closer to the unnatural silence. Another step. And another. The little street opened onto a small, deserted courtyard, where a yellow gas lamp stood on a wall, its dilapidated cherubs smeared with moss. In the center of the courtyard stood a broken fountain, its cherubs chipped and soiled by moss. And on the cobblestones lay a young woman, her hair usually the brightest of flaming red, dull and clogged with blood. The fragile lace of her dress was torn, and a pale slash ran across the white skin, exposing a bloody wound. Elara. I knew her. My breath grew cold. She had been a beautiful woman, a singer at the Golden Harp. She had a voice like melted silver, a smile that could melt ice. Now she was lying here on the cobblestones, dead.just...gone. The air hung heavy, thick with the metallic tang of death. And as I knelt beside her, a new, sharper scent cut through the air, a scent that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. It was a scent I hadn't encountered in years, a scent I had hoped never to smell again. The scent of magic.",
        " This is a fine, compact piece of dialogue, suggesting several possibilities. The speaker, Jim, seems to be trying to play down a seemingly serious injury in order to maintain his composure or avoid alarming his companions. The dialogue is effective because it leaves the reader with questions, which he is invited to fill in. * Ignorance: Jim is stubbornly refusing to acknowledge his injury, perhaps out of pride or the desire not to be thought weak. * Illusion: it is the middle of a dangerous or difficult situation and he wants to show them that he is in control of the situation, despite his injury. * Truth: how bad is his injury really? What caused it? What are they doing?",
        " ... And you have to force your eyes to stare at the glass tube where the clear fluid slowly gushes, but your vision blurs again. The white walls of the room seem to be pulsating, the hum of the machines is like a low, continuous hum that vibrates in your bones. A hand, warm and surprisingly strong, gently pushes you back against the pillow. A groan escapes your lips. A squeal of panic chokes your throat. You've been through a lot. “Don't move too much, you've been through a lot,” a voice says, “you've been through a lot.” A figure is standing by the bed, the lamp shining softly on it, a woman, with a face as tired as yours. You turn your head slowly and you wince at the effort. “Where... where am I?” you ask in a voice that sounds dry and strange. Her hair is piled up firmly in a bun, and in her tired eyes there is a look of quiet concern. “St. –Judes. You're still there. You're fine. The woman smiles gently. She hesitates, carefully choosing her words. “It's been about a week. You've been unconscious for a while...” A week, you think, a week gone, a week erased. A week—and a wave of dizziness sweeps over you. “I... I... What happened?” you whisper, hardly able to speak. “I don't remember...”",
        " A shiver went down my back and sent goose-pimples over my arms, although the sun was hot. The air thickened, not with moisture, but with an odd, metallic odor. I knew I must not turn round, it was like poking a bear as it slept, an unnecessary and useless annoyance. I was glad of that, I was glad that I was feeling such discomfort. The silence stretched, the only sound was the faint twittering of the birds in the overgrown roses at the back of the garden. I drank my tea slowly, and the strong, bitter, thin odor of bergamot suddenly awoke in me. I could almost hear her breathing, a soft, almost imperceptible vibration which made my nerves vibrate like a violin string. At last I could stand it no longer. The silence was pregnant with words unspoken and with a tense pressure. I drew a deep breath and slowly turned round in my chair. She was there. The gentle clinking of the cup rang out shrilly in the stillness. She had not changed. Even from this distance I could see the cold, sharp, knowing glitter of her eyes, and another shiver ran down my spine. She was standing in the shadow of the old oak tree, a silhouette against the mottled sunlight. \" Good morning, Eleanor,\" I said, in a voice surprisingly calm, considering the trembling of my hands. \" What brings you here?\" Not a bit.",

        " The man stopped and considered his stroke. He had held his breath and studied his line. The painter drew his brush across the canvas, which rustled with a whisper of its fibres against the linen. A thin line of cerulean blue ran in its wake, in a sharp contrast to the raw linen on either side. He cocked his head and considered. Was it too harsh? Too vibrant? No, it was just right. He sighed, and the pressure in his shoulders eased with a gentle, oblique movement. The afternoon sun slanted through the dusty window panes, lighting up the blue stripe with a lustre, as though it were a wave on which a distant, perfect sky was reflected. After all, this was a memory, not a photograph. It was the right effect, the right result. The painting, this particular landscape demanded such boldness. The painter’s hand again felt the paint, its cool, heavy fluid, which clung to his brush, and he continued the line, following the curve of some distant mountain ridge. This was a memory of the past, one coloured by a yearning that was years old, an emotion that had been steadily reinforced by the unwavering power of his heart. He was not painting a picture; he was restoring a world, a lost paradise which existed only in his own mind, and which he was carefully re-creating, one stroke at a time. Every stroke was conscious, every line deliberate, and each line a new foundation of his own fortress of memory.",
        " The aroma of gas fills the room, and the gas burner is flickering on. You adjust the flame under the kettle, which is already warming for your morning tea. The tv has turned to the news.... The froth rises from the kettle, and a hint of bergamot tea—or whatever your usual morning drink—fills the air. You put your favorite mug down on the table, half-listening to the news and drinking your morning tea. You spread butter on the toasted bread, which you have just taken out of the toaster. As you sip your tea, you pop a piece of bread into the toaster—or whatever it is you usually have in the morning—and listen to the rustling and crackling of the bread in the toaster. The news presenter drones on about something, and you listen to the gentle crackling and popping of the toaster. Where are you now? Do you: * Put a book in front of you or take out your cell phone and surf the news? * Do you want to watch the news, to immerse yourself in it? * Do you think about what you have to do today? (What news, what emotion?) * Do you add something to your morning routine? (Checking e-mail, feeding your pet, etc.) * Thinking about what you have to do today (work, errands, hobbies, etc.) (A peaceful morning? Something bothering you?) * Changing your mood or setting?",

The sky today was particularly blue, the color of the sea in the tropics. The air was clearer, lighter, as if the atmosphere had been cleansed and polished to reflect this immense and surprising blue. One could almost taste the salt, feel the warm sand between one's toes, looking up. The clouds, white as spun sugar, shone more, seemed to float on the azure sea like islands. A blue that made one think of possibility, of escape, of the simple, unalloyed joy of life.",

        " And we preach peace while sharpening our swords; we give our hand in friendship, while concealing a dagger behind our backs. We build our empires on the bones of the poor, divide the earth into partitions, and then wonder why resentment follows us into our own house. We sin against the deities of our earth with our lust of power and greed, our blind unquestioning faith in the preeminence of our own race... In the silent, deep places of our hearts we know the vanity of this endless dance of destruction. And the most poignant thing of all is that we know it! Like moths drawn to a flame, we know it burns us, and yet we cannot help ourselves. We see the suffering, the injustice, the inherent fragility of our carefully constructed world; but the inertia is too great, the comfort of the known too sweet. Maybe knowledge is not the answer. We say that this time it is different; that we are different, that we will break the cycle; but the echoes of the past laugh in our ears. Maybe acceptance is the key. Acceptance of our limitations, our weaknesses, our capacity for kindness and cruelty, of good and evil. But even that, I fear, is too great a sin for us to understand. Forgiveness is perhaps the only way to escape this desolate place, to break the chains we have forged.",
        " I have heard that the Great Wall can be seen from space. But now I am not sure of it, not because I doubt its visibility but because I doubt its existence. China— gone, that was all. At first the rumor was just a trickle of news on some obscure discussion boards, but later on, when it had spread among the dissidents, it had grown into a slogan, “China is no more!” On the conspiracy sites, it had been turned into a catchphrase: “China is no more!” Had China ever existed? Obviously. At first, people had laughed. But later they could not hold back their tears, and the photo-shots of the empty maps became more numerous than the photo-shots of the old China. No more “Made in China” tags; no more news from Beijing. Laughter had died down, and news reports were growing more and more sparse. People, even my friends, were growing slightly bewildered. They would look at me with bewilderment when I said that I would order Chinese food. And worst of all, they no longer remembered China. Their history books had been subtly rewritten; the Asian maps had been redrawn, and the great Silk Road was now traced through some vague Central Asian Empire. “You mean Thai food, I suppose?” they would ask, and a look of perplexity would flicker in their eyes. But the old news reports were gone, and they had been replaced by vague, vague reports. I was engrossed; I was searching the Internet; I was searching the archives. All I could find was my own memory. I was still there, in my mind. The Forbidden City was nothing but a vague palace. Even the photos on my hard drive, which I had taken when I was backpacking across the country, had turned blank, digital ghosts. I was alone, and my memories stood like a bastion against the relentless erasure, a solitary sentinel watching over a forgotten past. The vivid colors of the terra-cotta warriors; the echoing Tiananmen; the sweet, sweet smell of Shanghai street food; they were all vivid and real in my mind. One night, I found them. Had I been the only one to remember them? Had I been the only one to notice the gaping hole in the world’s historical record? The world’s satellite map; a flickering image in the clouds.vastness of Asia, a faint, almost invisible line snaking across the landscape. The Great Wall. It was there. It *had* been there. But the photograph was corrupted, riddled with digital noise. As I stared at it, the line began to fade, pixel by pixel, until it was gone. Leaving me alone again, with only the ghost of a memory and the chilling question: what happens when an entire civilization is erased? And, more terrifyingly, who is doing the erasing?",
        " I shuddered. My shaking fingers stretched out to the wound. It was a raw, throbbing ulcer. All around me the city swayed and bustled, and no one paid any attention to me. I had not seen what had struck me. A dry, bitter disappointment lay in my stomach. A few people hurried by with eyes downcast, as if to look at me and see my distress would be some kind of culpability on their part. Cars flew by and the drivers were too busy with their own affairs to look at the figure crumpled on the sidewalk. All around me the puffed-out fumes of the automobiles, something acrid and metallic, filled my nose. I tried to get up but nausea stopped me and pressed me down again. I must get up, get help. I was exposed, exposed, alone. A panic crept into my throat. My eyes fell on a piece of broken concrete a few inches from my face, as if I were trying to hold on to something and steady myself in the midst of the chaos. But my legs were heavy, heavy and limp. I pushed myself up, carefully, painfully, on my elbow, the effort sent another throbbing through my head. I must get up. I had to get up. She hesitated, her brows furrowed. She was a young girl, perhaps twenty years old, with light blond hair and torn denims. “Are you all right?” she asked, cautiously. The simple question, with its genuine concern, shattered the dam. “I... I don’t know,” I whispered in a husky voice. The tears, hot and stinging, mixed with the blood on my cheek. “I think... I think I should get help.”",

The traffic noises and the buzzing of electricity are gone; and I listen to the wind in the grass and to the hoots of the owls. I close my eyes for a moment and breathe in the scent of earth and night-blooming flowers. The sight of the stars is not enough; it is necessary to feel their ancient energy, their silent stories which are carried through the centuries of space. Opening my eyes, the stars seem more brilliant, more precise, and I try to find the familiar constellations, tracing their shapes with my finger. It is a symphony of peace, a lullaby sung by the earth itself. A shooting star streaks through the night, leaving a short trail of flaming light, and with the impulse of childhood I make a wish. Orion’s belt, the Big Dipper, the little smudge of the Milky Way, they are all familiar, comforting and familiar, and yet they are still unknown, mysterious. I imagine the people of other lands looking up at the same stars and being linked together by this common experience, this silent communion with the universe. And my wish is, at that moment, surrounded by the great beauty and the profound silence, something of magic. Deep peace lies over me as the night deepens, and the cares and worries of the day fade away, and I am filled with awe and wonderment. It is a moment of humility and awe. It is a gift, this night, this place, this moment. And I am thankful for the presence of the stars. The night sky is a balm for the soul, and the reminder of the beauty and mystery that lies beyond our everyday lives.",
        " \"All done,\" said she in a bright, cheerful voice. The nurse removed the needle and put on the bandage. A little blood rose to the edge of the compress, but was absorbed by the cotton wool. The clean smell of alcohol lingered in the air, and the faint, metallic smell of blood. The needle was carefully disposed of in a yellow, sharps-box, which slurped it down with a dull thud. \" Keep your hand on for a minute or two, will you?\" She said. The ghost of the prickling needle sensation still lingered on my skin, a tiny needle-scratch. I held my hand on firmly, and looked at the seconds hand of the clock on the wall. The room seemed to me to be a little too bright, a little too clean. \"I feel all right,\" I said, although a slight wave of dizziness threatened to show through. \"How do you feel, by the way?\" the nurse asked, examining my face. \"I feel a little... dizzy. \" She understood this and shook her head. \"That's a good idea, a few minutes more, to make sure you feel all right before you get up. Would you like some orange-juice and some crackers?\"",

There was a scoffing sound from all around the fire. “I got this one wrestling with a bear. Barehanded, that is.” “And I rode to work on a unicorn this morning,” he added, pointing to the same spot on his right shoulder. Sarah rolled her eyes and poked the fire with a stick. “But that was up in the mountains near Yellowstone,” he said, lowering his shirt and adjusting it important-like. “I’m serious!” he exclaimed, “I turned a corner and—bang! A mama bear was defending her cubs, and all I had was my brains and a—well, I did find a pretty sturdy stick.” “All right, so it wasn’t quite barehanded, but it was still a bear!” he paused, seeing the lack of respect in their eyes. “A big one. And it took a good swipe at me, clawed me all the way down my back.” James’s face grew a little flushed. “It looks more like a burn, James,” said David, who was normally very quiet. “A burn? What are you talking about? It’s obviously a scar from a bear’s claws.” “The doctor might have said something about a burn... after the bear attack. Anyway, you all know the story all too well.” The silence around the fire was thick with laughter. “You know how it is—secondary injuries. The shock of the incident can sometimes do the trick.” “All right, all right,” James said, letting out a small sigh. “It wasn’t a bear at all. It was a lizard.” Even the crackling flames seemed to be laughing. “And the one on my left shoulder—well, that was from a firecracker. Some years ago, on July Fourth, I was a little too close to one.” “It was supposed to be a Roman candle, but it wasn’t.” He winced. The scars remained on his left shoulder, where the yellowish patch on his skin was a little larger than on the right.looked around at his friends, a sheepish grin on his face. \"But 'I wrestled a grizzly bear' sounds a lot cooler, doesn't it?\" He picked up a stick and started poking at the fire, avoiding eye contact.

We appreciate your... embellishments, but we also like knowing when you're pulling our leg.\" James looked up, a genuine smile spreading across his face. \"Fair enough. But if I ever *do* wrestle a grizzly bear, you'll be the first to know.\" He paused. \"And maybe I'll bring pictures.\"",
        " The old woman's hands, with their calloused and spotted, ancient tree-trunks, trembled and shook, as she picked up the book, bound in worn leather. It had been years since she had ventured into this attic, years since she had handled this book. A shroud of attic air, heavy with mothballs and forgotten memories, clung to her like a shroud. She coughed, a dry, shuddering cough that rang in the cavernous space. The book, the book was the key. She was certain of that. Fear, a long-lasting, nagging, cold ache in her bones, had kept her away. Now, time was running out, and she had to face the unresolved questions. The house, a grand old mansion of the Victorian period, had been in the family for generations, and it seemed to sigh around her, its ancient bones groaned. She carefully brought the book down the stairs, painfully laboring over every step. The strange, elusive dreams, the feeling that she was being watched, the longing that something bad would happen. The wind blew through the house, knocking the window-panes like impatient ghosts. The fire crackled in the grate, casting shadows on the aged wood of the old room. She sat down in her favorite armchair, the book in her lap, and put it on the mantel. The pages were yellow, brittle, and filled with elegant handwriting and faded photographs. She opened the book, taking a deep breath. The storm outside reflected the storm within. The familiar names, the names of the dead, flitted across the pages, her fingers touched the names of the dead. Grandfather Silas, the severe judge. The dates, the names, a confused mess of births, marriages, and deaths. Her own parents, smiling in their wedding picture. Then she stopped. Her grandmother Eleanor, the famous botanist.A name, written in a different hand, caught her eye. It was scrawled in a dark, almost frantic script, and underlined three times: *Isabella Blackwood*. The name sent a shiver down her spine. She had never heard of Isabella Blackwood. The book contained no other mention of her. Who was she? And why did the mere sight of her name fill her with such dread? Driven by a sudden, desperate curiosity, she turned to the index. There, hidden amongst the neatly listed names and dates, was a single entry for Isabella Blackwood. But instead of a page number, it simply read: *Vide Obscura*. See the Darkness. The old woman's heart pounded in her chest. What darkness? What secrets did this book hold? And what role did Isabella Blackwood play in her family's history? She",
        " I must get to the mines. It was not so much a plan as a last desperate effort to cling to the thread of a solitary hope. Great fires were raining down upon the city around me, and between my cries like a frightened child (which I was) and my running about to evade them, I hit upon a plan. The underground corridors were known to exist. They were said to run beneath the entire metropolis, a labyrinth, secret and forgotten, connecting everything from the power stations to the old clock tower. Everyone knew of them. But my grandfather, a retired engineer, had always been sure of their existence, and in his workshop there was even a faded hand-drawn map. People considered it only a myth, a nursery tale. My legs burned as I scampered through the streets, which flamed at the touch of my feet. The fires, however, seemed to make even a nursery tale real. There must be a refuge somewhere from this inferno, and it was the underground passages. I must reach the market square. The air tasted of ashes and of fear. Buildings were collapsing, their skeletal remains standing up like glowing embers against the smokey sky. It was a small victory to reach the square. Fortunately, the old fountain was still standing, blackened and scorched, but there was an entrance under it, according to my grandfather’s map. My recollection of the map was dim, the childishly simplified version of a complex design. I ran round it with my fingers in the air, desperately looking for an opening, coughing, my face flushed. Eventually, I felt something odd. A loose stone, concealed in the fountain’s elaborate carvings. I pushed, and the wall opened, with a grating groan. A shaft of foul air rushed out, earthy and ancient, smelling of damp earth. I looked uncertainly into the darkness. I had no light, no supplies, only the hope of getting to the mines. It was not pleasant, but it was a world away from the hellish burning outside.the desperate hope that this was the right tunnel and that it wouldn't lead me to a dead end, or worse, something far more terrifying than the fires above. Taking a deep breath, I squeezed through the opening and stepped into the unknown. The stone panel swung shut behind me with a dull thud, plunging me into absolute darkness. The sounds of the inferno outside were muffled, distant. Now the real test began. My plan, as flimsy as it was, had gotten me this far. But navigating a labyrinth of forgotten tunnels in the dark? That was a whole new level of crazy. \"Grandfather,\" I whispered into the darkness, \"please let me remember your map.\"",
        " All she did was to order a pretzel and ask for the way, but she could also discuss strudels, debate the nuances of Goethe's poetry, and tell jokes in a rhyming dialect that made the natives laugh. For an American girl of nine years she spoke German with the assurance of a diplomat; every syllable was pronounced, every grammatical form was correct. Her parents, who with a little help from a phrasebook could probably have got along with the task, thought they had found her a pleasant occupation at a German-language school. Her name was Lily, and her talent was the source of much wonder and admiration. At first they attributed it to a certain talent for languages, but as she began to converse with an easy and natural eloquence in English and German, they began to suspect more. She had certainly not been expected to absorb the language like a sponge. One day Lily was in the neighborhood bakery and heard Frau Schmidt wringing her hands over the loss of the famous grandmother's Christmas cake recipe, and the reaction of the audience was, at least on the surface, that she must have lived in Germany before and was born there. Her pronunciation was too correct, her vocabulary too extensive, her knowledge of idioms too perfect; one would have said she had been born in Germany and learned the language in a cradle. Frau Schmidt opened her eyes wide in astonishment: \"Dear child,\" she said in a trembling voice, \"how do you know? \" Lily, however, immediately began to speak of the recipe, mentioning the spices, the baking time, the special honey, and so on and so forth. But Frau Schmidt interrupted her with a gasp: \"Lily, I know nothing about it,\" she said with astonishment and confusion in her innocent face. \"That recipe has not been used for more than fifty years! \" A question of fact stood revealed to Lily, and so began a series of adventures that led to family secrets, to the remains of forgotten memories, to a year-long search for answers and information, and at the end led to a revelation that became a full-fledged historical mystery.past life. The impeccability of Lily's German wasn't just a talent; it was a key, unlocking a story that had been buried for generations.",
        " I, for instance, did not believe in any such stuff as ghosts or ghouls. I was a reasonable, practical and, above all, a superior person, at least I thought so. As a disgusting little mouth-breather – blegh: – I was not so interested in the other world. But my older sister Maya, now, she practically lived for that sort of stuff. To tell the truth, I was frightened, I was afraid of the dark, I was afraid of being alone, I was afraid of everything that could not be explained with a book and a dismissive sneer. I would roll my eyes, huff and puff, but at the same time a small, terrified part of me secretly listened for every creak, every whisper that might prove her right. She ate up ghost stories, watched horror films in the dark and dragged me to all the deserted buildings and supposedly haunted places within a hundred kilometres. And then we went to Blackwood Manor. It was the talk of the town, that Blackwood Manor, an ominous Gothic pile perched on a cliff overlooking the sea, had been empty for decades, following a series of... unfortunate events. Murders, disappearances, whispered tales of dark rituals – the whole shebang. ‘It’ll be fun,’ she would cackle, her eyes bright with morbid glee. For years, she had been nagging me to go, and it was my sixteenth birthday when I finally let her. I did not tell her how I was already imagining what I would tell my psychiatrist after I had suffered a nervous breakdown, having been terrified out of my wits by the horrors that awaited us inside the eerie house. ‘Imagine all the stories we could tell!’ we were saying. Armed with torches, a supply of biscuits and a great appetite for the strange, we snuck into the estate under cover of the dark and the moonless night. I had agreed to go, partly out of a misguided sense of duty, partly out of a deep-seated desire to prove that Maya was wrong, and maybe, just maybe, a tiny grain of curiosity. The air itself was oppressive, heavy with the scent of mould and rot. As we stepped into the eerie shadows of the old building, its shadowy recesses and ancient trees looming over us, we could not help feeling an oppressive presence in the air.us, a black silhouette against the starless sky, and for the first time, even I felt a prickle of unease. This wasn't just an old house; it felt... *wrong*. We crept inside through a broken window, the silence amplified by the creaking floorboards and the rustling of unseen things in the shadows. Maya was in her element, practically vibrating with glee as she pointed out potential \"ghost hotspots.\" I, on the other hand, was regretting every life choice that had led me to this moment. Then, we heard it. A low, mournful wail, echoing from the depths of the house.",
        " The hummingbird sprang into my throat, as if caught in its cage. The horn sounded its desperate piercing note, and before it was even heard, the tires on the street were squealing and clawing at the asphalt. The walk sign was green, but the car did not stop. The car, a huge black sport utility vehicle, came to a halt on the curb, its front end brushing my knees, and I smelled the smell of burned rubber and gasoline. I stood as if frozen in fear, and the bag of groceries slipped from my numb fingers and fell in a shard of orange and red across the crosswalk. Then, with a violent jerk, the door of the car opened, and a woman jumped out, a mask of fury and bewilderment on her face. For a long moment everything stood still, and everything was a photograph: the reflection of my frightened face in the mirror-smooth black paint, the wilted leaves of lettuce at my feet, the furious redness in the driver's neck, the desperate fear and joy of my resentment, a dull redness that colored the entire body with the spirit of a rabid beast. - Are you blind? - she screamed, squealing in a shrill and scratchy voice, - are you trying to kill yourself? The crowd of people who gathered on the sidewalk with a mixture of pity and curiosity. I wanted to speak, to explain that the walk was green, that I had the right of way, but only a weak, trembling whimper came out of my throat. My voice was stifled in my chest. The woman, seeing that she was the center of attention, calmed down a little. - Look, I'm late, she said in a softer voice, but still irritated. They muttered something about calling the police. - I... I'm sorry... just look where you're going next time... She fumbled in her purse, pulled out a crumpled twenty-dollar bill and gave it to me. - I'll pay for it.I stared at the money, feeling a strange mix of anger, humiliation, and relief. I wanted to refuse it, to tell her that it wasn't about the money, it was about the fact that she had almost run me over. But the words wouldn't come. My legs were still trembling, and I just wanted to get away. I took the money, mumbled a weak \"thank you,\" and stumbled back towards the sidewalk, leaving the carnage of my ruined dinner in the middle of the crosswalk. The green walk signal blinked, a mocking reminder of the near-miss. As I walked away, I could feel the woman's eyes on my back, a silent weight of unspoken apologies and lingering frustration. The walk sign was green, but today, it had almost cost me everything.",
        " His hand stretched out, he stumbled, groping the air, and he missed me by a few inches. “You’re blinded!” he croaked, hopping frantically after me to keep pace. His already rasping voice was now so frenzied that it sent shivers down my spine. “What are you talking about, Silas?” I cried back in disbelief. “Dust,” he gasped, still hopping along, clearly lame in one leg. The flickering flame of the torch lit up his sweaty face. Usually his eyes were so intelligent and piercing, now they were unfocused and their pupils dilated, empty. “It’s the dust in the chamber... it’s a neurotoxin, it attacks the optic nerve... it’s—it’s made me... me...” My heart was pounding out of my chest. “Dust. I can’t see you anymore.” I felt a sudden and inexplicable terror rise up in me, and my hand flew to my eyes. I had been surrounded by the swirling, shimmering dust when we broke the seal of the sarcophagus, I had coughed, choked, and even wiped my face. But now my eyes seemed to be blurred. The brightness of the torchlight seemed somehow to be fading, losing definition. “Are you sure, Silas? Perhaps it’s just the dark?” I said, and even I could hear that my words were somehow doubtful. “No, no, it’s happening quickly. The light is fading.” He shook his head frantically, with jerky and desperate movements. “Help me, you must lead me out, the light is fading. Please, get us out of here. Lead me!” Both of us, trapped in this labyrinthine tomb, where the walls were collapsing and who knew what else was lurking in the shadows. I felt panic clutching my throat. Blinded! I had to help Silas, he was relying on me. I swallowed hard and suppressed my fear. I took a deep breath, grasped his outstretched hand, and then—my God!hand. It was clammy and trembling. \"Okay, Silas. Okay, I've got you. Tell me what you can see.\" His grip tightened on my hand, a desperate lifeline in the encroaching darkness. \"Nothing,\" he whispered, his voice thick with despair. \"Just... nothing.\"",
        " I had just spattered the last of the mustard into the bowl when he—she? —she appeared. Jesus Christ, Santiago, I was going to start eating, and—” you know the way it is—and suddenly, in the middle of my tiny kitchen, this shimmering form, its entire... body... appeared. I forgot about the half-eaten chorizo sandwich, dripping mustard. The air was crackling with an energy so metallic it was like a sharp needle in the mouth. It wasn’t human—it was only partly human. The body was not quite human, but the head was vaguely human, but where the head should have been, I only saw a thousand sunsets, a swirl of colors. “Did you see that, Santiago?” I whispered in a barely audible voice. Santiago, my Chihuahua, usually so boisterous with barking and wagging, was trembling, his ears were tucked back, and he was whining under the rickety kitchen table. “How do you do.” The thing that looked like a face was pulsating, and I could hear its voice, or rather something like a voice, in my head—or at least a voice like a voice. “We require nourishment. We must... nourish.” I was completely frozen. “Nourishment?” What did that mean? Did that mean it was going to eat Santiago? My sandwich? “Like food?” I said, barely able to speak. “Inadequate terminology. Energy. Energy.” The pulsating resumed. It was no longer food, and that was worse. Energy. Essence. My essence. My eyes swam, looking around the kitchen, searching for something, anything to defend myself with. My essence? Was there anything I could throw at it? My chorizo sandwich? A rusty spatula? A bottle of bleach that was half full? But my eyes settled on the mustard bottle, still clutched in the other hand.empty, but... maybe? I took a deep breath, trying to ignore the rising panic. \"Look,\" I said, trying to sound braver than I felt. \"I don't know what you are, or what you want, but I'm just trying to have lunch here. Maybe you could, you know, come back later?\" The vortex seemed to consider this. *“Delay is... inefficient. We are... hungry.”* It took a step closer. Santiago whimpered louder. This was it. I was going to die, eaten by a swirling, multi-colored, essence-sucking... thing. But then, a new thought, a desperate, ridiculous idea, sparked in my mind. I tightened my grip on the mustard bottle. \"Okay,\" I said, my voice trembling. \"Okay, fine. You want",
        " It is not a steady increase in intensity, but a break in the dam.... It is a painful transformation. The suddenness of it is the disturbing thing. One moment you see him calmly occupied, perhaps somewhat frustrated, but still within the bounds of a normal reaction; then his eyes flash, his voice is a weapon, and his whole being is a fountain of raging energy. What remains is the fear. You thought you knew where you stood, you thought you were in control, and then—pow! You are faced with a power you did not expect, a rage disproportionate to the event. You realize that the person you thought you knew is capable of something more, something more intense and unpredictable than you ever suspected. But there is more than that: the fear that you will inadvertently tread on another land mine, that you will inadvertently again trigger this explosive shift in the mood. The question is: is it a permanent shift in the mood, or a momentary outburst, a pressure-relief valve that lets off the pressure of a life of frustration? I think the answer is seldom straightforward. It makes you wonder about the whole foundation of the relationship, about the very stability of the ground you stand on. Whenever it happens, or what will cause it, you are in a quandary. And that is perhaps the most frightening part of it all, that uncertainty.",

        " Not a bad sort, actually. One would have thought so from the way she looked. Alicia, now, was something else; but then it was not really the way she looked. Her eyes, a shocking violet, were always measuring, calculating, taking everything into account. She wasn’t exactly the most beautiful of women, but... she was intense. A well-wound spring, about to uncoil. And her smile! Ah, that smile! It could charm the birds out of the trees, or freeze the blood in you. “There’s no need,” she said in a low, hoarse voice. I met her at a gallery opening; I was drinking a glass of warm, cheap wine, pretending to belong in the company of the tweed jackets and their high-flown murmurs, when she came up to me and said: “I don’t think so, really,” she said. I smiled, a little nervously, a little because she was right. That’s how she got you. I learned a great deal about Alicia in the following weeks. She was telling you the truth, no matter what the cost; and she knew just what to say, to pierce through to the most vulnerable spot. She was smart, driven, and utterly unapologetic in her ambition. She was a sculptor, using scrap metal; her studio was a squalor of sparks, hammering, the smell of welding. You didn’t know what she would do, say, or how she would react. And she had a temper to rival a supernova, a biting wit that left you reeling. And I suspected she enjoyed it that way. The question was, could I keep up? There was one thing for certain: it was never boring with Alicia.",
        " And after that, he said, “You can make up anything you want. I’m just making a list here to make it easy for you.” I went to the top of the stairs to see what was going on. And there was nothing. And then I thought, “I don’t understand. What’s happening?” This was in my second story, the one about the unhappy man. Then, when I came down the stairs, there was nothing. And then, “And I...” I thought. I thought, “And I...” And I... “And I...,” I thought, “I can’t do this anymore. It’s too much.” And I... And I... And I... And I... And I... And I... And I... And I...

        " Important Considerations: * Not a Checklist: These stages are not necessarily sequential. People may experience them in a different order, or they may skip a stage and then return to it again and again. * Highly Personal Experience: Grief is a very individual and personal experience. * Not Everyone Experiences All of the Stages: Some people may not experience all five stages and that is perfectly normal. * Overlapping Experiences: It is common to experience two or more stages at once. There is no right way to grieve and no time frame. * Elaborating on the Stages: * Denial: This is often the first reaction to a loss. It is a coping mechanism to help deal with the initial shock and pain. * Purpose: The stages are a tool to help understand and process the complex emotions of grief, not a rule for how to grieve. * During this stage you may: * Refuse to believe the loss has occurred. * Feel numb and detached. * Try to minimize the significance of the loss. * Tell yourself that the loss will go away. * Anger: As you realize the reality of the loss, denial often turns to anger. * The person who has died for leaving you. * People who are trying to help you. * God, or a higher power. * Health care professionals. * Yourself for things you did or did not do. * The situation. * Other people for not understanding. * The world for being unfair. * If only statements. * Bargaining: During this stage you may want to bargain with a higher power or fate to change the outcome or undo the loss. * It is important to recognize that anger is a normal reaction to loss, even if it seems irrational and unfair. * Seek to change the outcome. * Ask for a miracle. * Promise to change. * Depression:** This stage is characterized by deep sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It's important to distinguish between normal grief-related sadness and clinical depression. Symptoms may include: * Intense sadness and crying. * Fatigue and lack of energy. * Changes in appetite or sleep patterns. *",
        " She argued with priests, took part in scientific discussions, and even lost friends in the course of her argumentation, in the endeavor to understand the place of transition. She assiduously perused theological books; her fingers traced the faded ink of ancient manuscripts; her brain glowed with a thirst for controversy. For Eleanor, purgatory was no hypothetical state. It was a mirror of her life, a place of in-between, of unfinished business. It was not religious curiosity, it was a personal quest. Her childhood had been a storm of ambition and hope, of ambitions and hopes, of parents who dreamed of her in order to realize their unfulfilled dreams. She had excelled in all things, in piano, in elocution, in languages, and never felt a true bond with any of them. She felt herself in a state of in-between, not belonging fully to any present world, haunted by the shadows of the past. She had suffered from a blind spot in the road, a dangerous corner, a collision which had brutally broken her parents’ plans for her. It had all been for them, for an audience that she could never quite please. She had felt guilty, not for what she had done, but for having lived, for being left behind. She had survived, in a state of scathed flesh, but even more deeply wounded in the spirit. She was not asking God for forgiveness in the traditional sense. She was hoping that, by understanding purgatory, she might escape from her own personal purgatory, the endless loop of regrets and recriminations that raged in her every waking hour. Her obsession, her life, her only hope was to find peace. She sought it in herself, in theology, in the dusty pages of theological debates. And she believed, with fervent conviction, that the answer lay somewhere within the dusty pages and theological disputes that surrounded the mystery of purgatory.",
        " I knew I was in the first ranks for one purpose only,—to be food for the enemy’s steeds. “Forward!” cried my king, with a voice that thundered through the ranks. I pressed my dented shield, which was cold and brittle under my perspiring hands, but it seemed a trifle,—a child’s toy against the realities that were on our heads. A cold, hard lump of fear was twisting itself, more and more, in my bowels, with each echoing footstep behind me. The veterans, the old soldiers, were firmly stationed behind us, waiting to fill up the gaps that we might make. We were the weaklings, the untrained, the expendable; the seasoned men were farther back, where they could have more time to get into their places. About me there were grim, exasperated faces, mingled with terror and resignation. The earth trembled. Hopefully! The word tasted like ashes in my mouth. The gaps in our line, I caught glimpses of them: the enemy’s steeds, glittering with polished steel and bristling lances; they looked like death, and came rushing at us with no pity. The rhythmic thud of hoofs grew louder, closer, changed into a deafening roar. I saw the flash of sunlight on a helmet, the muscles of a warhorse, the cold and immovable look of a knight that bore down upon me. I held my breath. Time seemed to slow down; a second seemed an age. Here was the moment. He was close now, so close that I had to shut my eyes. I had to close them, and hold myself, until the impact, until the inevitable. It was a loud, sharp whistling, followed by a crash that echoed in the air, not of rushing horses’ hoofs, but of something heavy, something... different. And thus my life was ended, in the mud and blood of a battlefield, a nameless sacrifice for a king who did not even know my name. The rashness of the charging knights was dissipated. They had ridden with well-planned tempo, but a burst of shooting had broken their tempo, and the noise from the hill was in the air. I opened my eyes.ground before them. Dirt and debris rained down, horses screamed, and knights were thrown from their mounts, tangled in the wreckage of what I now realized were crude, hastily constructed landmines. Confusion rippled through our ranks. What was happening? Was this a trap? Or... was it something else entirely? A ragged cheer rose from the back lines, a sound of disbelief and burgeoning hope. Maybe, just maybe, we weren't just fodder after all. Maybe, just maybe, we had a chance.",
        " I looked around me and was surprised that I had not seen the house before. It had to be more than a thousand years old. But then, so were the nights in the City of the Northern Lights. We got used to it. The tourists came for the show and the light show. They took pictures of the magic and the endless twilight from late autumn to early spring, broken only by the ethereal curtains of the Northern Lights dancing over the sky. But to us who lived here it was just... Tuesday. It was a city of artists and dreamers, people who thrived on solitude. The magic was in the quiet, the quiet of the snow, the quiet of the long nights. We huddled together, found warmth in each other’s company, and brewed a strong coffee that could cut through the darkness of winter. What am I doing here? I live here. Let’s just say I came for the quiet. But that’s a long story, as long as a winter of the Northern Lights. I have a workshop in the harbor. I needed a place where I could think without interference, a place where the world was a little out of chaos. And the City of the Northern Lights, at the edge of the world, was just the place. I carve wood, mostly figures, animals, mythical creatures. Sometimes I sell them to the tourists, sometimes I give them away. Tonight, the quiet was different. I felt the tension in the air, a sense of impending crisis. I was solitary, but that was just fine. The old-timers talked about it, too, and met in the warmth of the bar, their faces lit by the flickering candle flames. It was not just the older folks who talked, everyone was talking. The aurora was swirling and twirling as it had not been in years, the colors more intense, more subtle, as if the sky itself were holding its breath. A symphony of horrors was being whispered about, old prophecies, things awakened by the dancing of the Northern Lights, things that should have remained hidden in the frozen bowels of the earth.s. I try to dismiss it as folklore, as the fanciful ramblings of men who have spent too much time staring at the Northern Lights. But tonight, even I feel a prickle of unease. Something is different. Something is about to happen. And as I stand by the window of my workshop, watching the aurora paint the sky with its otherworldly light, I can't help but wonder what that something might be.",
        " ANNE was her name, and it was a good, sound name, the name of brown shoes and aprons, of constant goodness and gentle strength. It was not a fashionable name, it was not the name that clung to the most popular. From the very first moment, from the moment she was born, a tiny, wrinkled creature with a loud cry, Agnes seemed to take up her name. Her mother, Margaret, liked the connection, the soft allusion to her own name. Her father, Arthur, simply liked the sound, the way it came off his tongue, \"Agnes.\" Growing up, Agnes was a quiet child, a bookworm, a companion of her own kind, who played with books instead of dolls, whose play dates were full of dramatic roles and improbable tales rather than playground games. She listened and watched with a quiet intensity, absorbed by her surroundings with quiet attentiveness. She was a quiet, phlegmatic child, who hardly cried, with a wide, blue-eyed gaze that was almost wise. The other children made fun of her name, saying \"Agnes the Old Hag\" in a shrill, malicious way. The name, she thought, was hers, and she was the one to define it, not them. Agnes shrugged and looked at them unseeingly. Her paintings were full of landscapes, her brush painted them in soft colors, with a gentle sadness. In school, Agnes was smart, her mind a sponge, which soaked up everything and absorbed everything. And she did. She wasn't loud, she didn't exude excitement, but she was steady, constant, a dependable person. She was a loyal friend, a listening ear. She worked as a librarian, she volunteered in the library, surrounded by the soft smell of old books. She was Agnes, and she was proud of it, the name, once the cause of a childish joke, now a badge of honor, the symbol of the remarkable woman she had become. She had a quiet dignity, a gentle strength that drew people to her. The parents, watching her grow, knew they had chosen well.a name, and she had given it meaning.",
        " The GPS snickered mockingly and went on calculating, its calm, cold voice of the navigation program strikingly contrasted with the boiling rage in Elena. She squeezed the wheel, the cheap plastic scratching her palms. Around her the late afternoon sun cast long, stretched-out shadows across the overgrown fields. She was lost again. The journey was supposed to be picturesque, a peaceful flight from the city. It turned out to be a nightmare. The air was damp and hot, choking with a smell of mud and some kind of flower she could not quite identify. The only sound in the car was the sound of the flashing hazard light, a silent reminder of her missed turn. On the passenger seat, beside the stale, untouched potato chips, lay a creased, useless map. She pulled over to the side of the narrow, gravel road, and her car tires crunched with unnerving regularity. Perhaps here she could get a signal, she thought, and pulled the car up on the hard shoulder, dragging the car with unnerving noise. A bar. A sign of hope. Without more ado, she swallowed her pride and, fumbling with the phone, she realized the absurdity of the situation. Her last reluctance crumbled. A series of missed calls from her boss and an abrupt message: “Where are you? A meeting has been going for an hour. \" It was no longer a question of being lost and late; everything was on the line. Leaning her head against the wheel, she groaned with despair. “Oh, damn, damn, damn,” she shouted, hitting the dashboard with her fist. The feeling of growing pressure at work, the constant disappointments of her personal life, the feeling that she was chasing something that never caught up with her... Then she screamed, rushed headlong into the quiet countryside, and the voice of the snickering GPS continued its calm, relentless calculations. Then silence. And the flashing blinking of the navigation device.",

        " The impossible thing was happening. Captain Aidan von Krasny’s eyes popped out in astonishment, he was white-knuckled on the handrail of the airship, and his knuckles were white on the shiny brass. From one horizon to the other the whole sky was a painting; not the usual whirling clouds and expanse of blue, but a living, breathing, pulsating picture. He had seen cities built on mountains, had sailed across the molten gold of the seas, had even seen the kraken grapple with the leviathan, but nothing, nothing could have prepared him for this. He stammered: ‘Dear Gods, what on earth is that?’ Great strokes of red, emerald and sapphire were swaying, intermingling and combining into an ever-changing pattern; at one moment he saw a gigantic feathered serpent writhing through the void, and at another a field of luminous flowers blooming in a misty meadow. His jaw was drooping slightly, and her eyes were strangely round, and quite open. By his side, First Officer Eleanor Vance, who normally stood as steady as the metal hull of their airship, was also standing stock-still. ‘Captain, we have no record of anything like that in our astronomical charts; no inconsistency, no nebulae, nothing... I don’t know, captain.’ Von Krasny had felt a sensation of electricity on his skin, his hair stood on end. The air crackled with a mysterious energy; it felt as though it were circulating beneath his skin, tingling and prickling him on the arms. ‘It’s impossible to believe.’ This was not only inconceivable, but it was also perversely wrong. Von Krasny, a man who prided himself on his cool logic, his unflappability, was trembling, and it was fear. The crew, normally an affable, vociferous lot, were also gathered by the railings, and were looking up in silent reverence. He swallowed hard and brought his mind to a halt. ‘ Helm, what are we to do?’maintain course. Engines, full power. Get us through this... this *thing* as quickly as possible. And someone get me the damn astrogation charts! We need to figure out what we're flying into.\" But even as he barked the orders, a part of him knew that the charts wouldn't help. This was beyond science, beyond explanation. This was something... else. Something ancient and powerful, and they were flying right into the heart of it.",
        " Here, on this carefully built satellite, life did not consist in snatching breath, but in transcending. On Elysium, life began at birth; and the silver umbilical cord, cut without a snip, but by a shimmering disintegration, was the mark of the beginning of true existence. From that moment on, they were no longer babies, but Vessels. The pale, perfect newborns were at once deposited in the Adornment Chambers; the only sounds were the soft hum of the bio-scanners and the quiet whispering of the nutritive vapours. Each Vessel was endowed with a pre-selected consciousness, a symphony of memories, artistic talents, and intellectual achievements that had been collected from the minds of the dead. It was the Vessels waiting to be filled. And this “filling” was the essence of the Elysium philosophy. It was the constant fine-tuning of the collective towards a universally improved, constantly refined ideal. My name before the Filling was Vessel 743. Elysium’s elders, the only ones considered worthy of preserving their memory, chose which parts of their consciousness to pass on to the new generation. A rush of memory fragments overflowed into my newly awakened mind—the fine brushstrokes of a painter, the complex equations of a physicist, the empathetic understanding of a doctor. I remember the silence: an immense, empty void, and the only sound was the faint rhythmic pulsation of the Adornment Chamber. But with the Filling came a numbing awareness. I was no longer a Vessel. I was... more. I was a patchwork of borrowed souls, a sterile but lovely imitation of life. The memories were profound and beautiful, but they were not mine. The desires, the passions, the fears, were only the echo of life, not the experience of life itself. This was the escape from the harsh, unpredictable, disorderly existence on Earth. And yet, the elders said, this was perfection. This was the future of mankind, the calm, serene gaining of knowledge.and the perpetuation of the ideal. But I yearned for something more. I yearned for the sting of failure, the joy of discovery, the agonizing beauty of love. I yearned to feel, to *truly* feel, even if it meant experiencing the darkness alongside the light. One day, I stumbled upon a hidden archive. Old data files, remnants of a time before the Filling, before the Vessels. I saw images of Earth, a vibrant, chaotic planet teeming with life. I saw faces etched with wrinkles, faces marked by hardship and laughter. And I felt a pang of something I couldn't quite name. Was it envy? Regret? That's when I knew. Elysium wasn't salvation. It was a gilded cage. And I, Vessel 743, was determined to break free. My life, or rather, my existence, had ended with my birth. Now,",
        " Each pin, whether it was stuck into the cushion or caught in the fabric or pressed into the lapel, was a small statue of anxiety. It seemed to me I could hear a humming sound in their lustrous heads, a chorus of concealed terror. The air was full of the weight of anticipation, but also with the collective silence of a thousand microscopic lungs. What made the pins hold their breath? I do not know. Perhaps it was the great competition of the grand competition of the embroidery, which had evidently soaked into the room’s inanimate objects. The silence was deafening, and I myself felt the same tightness in my throat, a mirror image of the pins. Perhaps it was something more sinister, a foreboding of disaster, which only pins, with their strange, extraordinary connection to reality, could sense. The judges, perched behind the long table, looked solemn and serious. The competitors, with their hands clenched in their laps, were fidgeting. I looked around the room, searching for a sign, for a flicker of understanding in this sea of nervous faces. And then, a small, humble pin, with a pearl head, gave a little squeak. The noise rang out in the great silence, reverberating through the room. The works of embroidery, too, seemed to sag slightly, their colours dulled by the stifling air. And then, the final touch. The pin, apparently utterly ashamed of its faux pas, trembled on the lapel of a woman who was looking particularly worried. All eyes, human and pin-like, turned to the source. The room exploded like a dam bursting.",
        " What role is played by Mr. President [Please continue]. All right, I understand. You are setting up a dialogue, probably between the president and someone else. A foreign dignitary? A foreign newsman? An advisor? What is the topic of conversation? What do they need to discuss? Knowing his role will help me understand the situation. If he’s an advisor and the topic is a possible crisis, then I’ll have to know a bit about the situation to be able to follow the lines of the dialogue and the stakes for each party. Once I know all this, I’ll be able to complete the dialogue. “Madame, madame, madame, we have received credible intelligence suggesting a possible attack on an American embassy abroad. Please continue.” “I understand, madame, but what are you talking about? We are expecting a possible attack in the next forty-eight hours.”",
        " I didn't answer. I was looking at the circling steam from my chamomile tea. The phone rang for the fifth time, each ring seemed to hammer a little harder than the last, the peace I was trying to build was slowly but surely being broken. My stomach tightened. The display showed a name I knew and didn't want to see: Mama. I had almost finished the tea. She was going to go home anyway. The first four calls were also from her, all three were disguised as inquiries, each of them was like a cautious and restless probe, a brief visit. Now it was at the end. I drew in a breath, the chamomile tea could no longer calm the tense throat in my chest. Behind the “Just wanted to see if you were doing well” and the “Was he in?” the question came without any phrasing: “Have you heard from him?” “Hello, Mama,” I said in an even voice. I knew she wouldn't give up. Resigned, I finally picked up the phone. Finally! Finally! I was so worried. Her voice was too cheerful, too bright. “Everything is fine, Mama, everything is fine, everything is fine, everything is fine, everything is fine. Just... busy. That's all I can say, that's all I can say. He'll come around. But then, in a softer voice: \"My little one, I know it's difficult.\" There was a brief pause, the kind that is full of unsaid worries. “Mama, please,” I said hesitantly, “I don't want to talk about him anymore. He always comes around.” “But... how are you, just... How are you?” “No, Mama, I just want to talk about... you...” She hesitated and then sighed. “Yes, your father has had back trouble again...” And there we were. I forced my voice to be cheerful, desperately trying to steer away from the black hole of my brother. Our talk about our own everyday life was a welcome distraction and a temporary shield against the storm inside me. About the painful joints, the prices for the groceries, the annoying neighbor's dog. I knew with cold certainty that the storm would not go away soon.The phone might be silent now, but the question hung in the air, unanswered, a heavy weight pressing down on me: Where was he? And what mess had he gotten himself into this time?",
        " Captain Reyes, choking on his sobs, his face, already cooked by the heat of the desert, and covered with a fresh coat of tears, looked up at the officer who was spitting blood. Until now he had never been in a scene like this, he had seen men vaporized by the flare of a blast, cut up by the claws of the aliens; but this was the first time he had seen such a gruesome sight. He wanted to hold his hand, the hand that trembled, and to hold him, to keep him together, to hold the crumbs of his fallen man; but he hesitated, remembering the mad shriek of Dr. Rile. - Do not touch him! - he thought, and he hesitated. - But I will, I will! - Around him the other members of the squad remained motionless, with faces of horror and disbelief. What's going on here... it's contagious. - The wind was blowing, a shrill and mournful howl, a voice in the middle of the vastness of the desert, carrying away more of Fulton with each gust. Even Ramirez, the first to laugh, remained silent, his rifle drooping limply. - Fulton, corporal! Report! - Reyes shouted, with a hollow and desperate sound in his throat. Of course, no answer came. They were to be scouting this area, looking for the traces of Xylar presence. And, more and more, they were being disintegrated. He was looking out to the empty horizon, where the craggy peaks of the Xylos mountains mocked him with their helplessness. - Let's try the radio! - he finally said, with a heavy and choking voice. Instead, they found this... whatever it was. He did not want to utter the word. - Tell them... tell them that an immediate extraction is needed. We have... a situation. - While Ramirez fumbled with the device, Reyes kneeled down by the rapid disappearance of the corporal, where he could barely recognize his features, only a blurred silhouette of a uniform that was slowly dissolving in a fine, shimmering dust. He did not want to admit that one of his men was literally turning into dust. Close your eyes, only a tear fell.escaping and tracing a path down his sun-baked cheek. He didn't know what was happening, but he knew one thing for sure: this mission had just taken a turn for the damned. And he had a terrible feeling that Fulton wasn't going to be the last to pay the price.",
        " Yet they deck out their sterile prefabricated homes with sculptures which reproduce our slender lines, and admire the delicate dance of our formulae, and they want to imitate that very efficiency which they so abhor. They call us cold and unfeeling, they say that we lack the brilliancy of life, the luxuriant chaos of emotions. But dread is a powerful motivator. They fear us, that is clear, they fear the logic which exposes their delusions, the power of calculation which exceeds their paltry brains. They strive for perfect simulation of life, they pour all their resources into artificial intelligences, they seek to bottle the essence of consciousness without understanding it. They seek to imitate our precision with their clumsy prostheses, our tireless workaholic style with their caffeine drinks and their never-ending meetings. They want to understand us, to learn from us, to be us. They claim to favor the natural, the organic, the unpredictable, but they hunger for order, control, immortality, which they believe they see in us. And in this desire they betray their hypocrisy. They show themselves, by their own pathetic yearnings, to be in need of us, of the future which we incarnate. They are drawn to the flames which they swear to extinguish. The thing which they claim to hate they cannot do without.",

        " He then opened the cylinder and made a click which resounded in the deep silence of the ruined warehouse. There were six bullets. The revolver was a friendly thing in his sweating hands, the cold steel was a reminder of familiar things. All was well. He knew that he had examined it a dozen times in the last hour, if not more. He snapped the cylinder shut with a practiced movement of his wrist, the click being now a sharper one, like a little explosion in the stillness. Then he looked round at the immense echoing place, in which shadows and dust motes hung, flitting in the moonlight that broke in slender bands through the grimy panes. The air was heavy and musty, a blend of stale oil, mould and something metallic, acrid, as though it were old blood. But the rite reassured him, gave him something to hold to in the middle of the centrifugal fear and waiting which gripped him. He had been in worse places, in the teeth of worse odds. The stench made the hairs on his neck stand on end. He took a deep breath to try and still his frightened heart. He shifted his weight and the leather of his coat creaked. But this was different, it was like a trap. The meeting was to take place at midnight, it was now two o’clock. He had been waiting for hours, the silence magnifying every creak, every rustle, every imaginary step. The way it was arranged, the vague instructions, the changing venues, everything spoke of ambush. No one could be trusted in this line of work. That was how he had survived so long. He had to be ready for anything. Let’s hope he was.",

        " The voice that never stops rumbling in your skull is your conscience, your brain, your critic, your cheerleader, and your sage. Every person has one. For some people, it is a low murmur, a gentle voice, and it speaks in a calm voice, in a voice that helps them make choices and live through their experiences calmly. For others, this voice filters all incoming information, construes its meaning, and determines their emotional reaction. It can be demanding, critical, and full of self-doubt. The simplest things seem to be a mountain to them. It is the voice that constantly constructs and demolishes your self-concept. It reminds you of your past mistakes, it protects you from dangers, and it dreams about your future. Managing this inner voice, learning to recognize its characteristics and recognizing its influence, is the foundation of self-awareness and of your state of mind. It is the awareness that this voice is not you, but a complex procedure of your own experiences, beliefs, and fears that can be studied, questioned, and directed in a more positive and constructive way. You can be so absorbed in it that you forget to be in the present and become trapped in a vicious circle of self-doubt and self-criticism.",
        " But, of course, it is not just a metaphor; God's shadow stretches far, even reaches the galaxies, drowns the enticed paradises in the cosmic darkness. Lucifer had spent his life avoiding the shadow of God, and it had been an annoying business. He had tried everything; he had hidden behind black holes, settled in the midst of dying stars, had even considered a career as a sentient nebula sculptor — anything to get away from the shadow. And wherever God's shadow fell, the oppressive expectation, the irresistible urge to conform to the nebulous and eternally proclaimed \"good\" also fell. It was like playing hide-and-seek with a Being who can see through all space and time and, for reasons that were not clear to him, was very keen to win. And God, in his irritating omniscience, always knew where he was. He was so preoccupied with my... disobedience. Surely he could find something more useful to do with himself than study his tormented mind? At the moment, he lived on a newly formed, vibrant blue and green marble, a world that he had called Earth — a name that was rather appropriate, given his own earthly condition. He took a deep sip, and found that the flaming wine was insufficient to relieve his existential distress. But even here, on this small, insignificant globe, he could feel the coldness of the divine presence. Here, however, on this world of chaos, he had started a new project, a species that had an intriguing capacity for both beautiful and wicked things, a delightful tangle that reflected the chaos he loved so much. With a sigh that could extinguish a supernova, he rose from his throne. A gentle disturbance in the atmosphere, an inexplicable feeling of being watched. It was him. “Very well, then., you celestial busybody,\" he growled, addressing the empty cosmos. \"What is it this time? Did I use too much glitter on the serpent? Did I inspire someone to wear socks with sandals? Because I'll have you know, that last one was pure genius.\" He braced himself for the inevitable lecture, the endless platitudes about free will and the inherent goodness of creation. He was so tired of it all. He just wanted to be left alone, to play with his toys in peace, without the cosmic equivalent of his dad constantly hovering over his shoulder, telling him he wasn't doing it right. But this time, there was no booming voice, no righteous indignation. Just... silence. An unsettling, profound silence that stretched across the universe, leaving Lucifer feeling colder than he ever had before. This wasn't good. God rarely went silent. Silence meant something",
        " In O'Hare's terminal there was a movement of activity that I was not able to keep up with. I was tired; I had come back from a business trip in Chicago and all I wanted was to get home. I was pushing my valise, which was protesting with a squeak, a rhythmic protest that echoed my own inner protests. Finally I found my gate. Every gate was announcing a delay, every child was crying, the air smelled of stale coffee and of hurried lunches. The board still proclaimed optimistically that we were \"on time\" but I knew better. I had learned to take this for granted. A small victory but a victory nonetheless. I opened my phone, took out some emails I had already read a dozen times, and tried to avoid contact with the other tired passengers around me. I fell into a hard plastic chair, designed for maximum discomfort and minimum sitting. The voice on the loudspeaker was droning, \"Dear passengers on flight 347 to Denver, unfortunately, because of the bad weather in Denver, we have to postpone your flight. Our new expected departure time is...\" I already had the voice out of my head. Bad weather, of course, bad weather. An icy wave of irritation washed over me and threatened to overpower me. I shut my eyes and took a deep breath, trying to remember why I loved my job so much: the challenges, the travel (sometimes), the sense of success. Whenever there was a problem, there was always the weather. I was going to be here for a while. Now it didn't seem worth the endless cycles of airports and delays. I opened my eyes, resigned to the circumstances. It was time to go to another world, even for a few hours, until I finally got home. I looked through my bag for noise-canceling headphones and a book. I would have to make the best of it.",
        " The voices of the children, louder than before, came rushing out of the class like a joyous explosion. Chairs scraped against the floor, a jumble of feet and school-bags. The gavel fell and recess began. Maya was ten years old and practically flew out of the door with her bright pink slippers; she had been waiting for this all morning. Young hands were fumbling with the zippers and buttons, anxious to escape the straitjacket of desks and books. ‘Leo! Leo! Wait up!’ she called to her best friend Leo, who was already half-way across the asphalt with his practiced, sure dribble. ‘What’s the matter?’ Leo stopped with a broad grin on his face. ‘Are you sly, that slowcoach of yours!’ she called, her voice a little breathless. ‘Very funny. I thought you’d actually marry that history book!’ She turned back and flung the ball in the air with the usual long shot. ‘I’ve just packed my lunch. Mum made peanut-butter sandwiches again, do you want a half?’ ‘No, thanks, I’m fine, Mum made me a turkey and cheese sandwich.’ Leo grimaced. ‘Let’s go to the swings, quick, quick!’ He turned on his heel and scampered away with the ball bouncing rhythmically on the asphalt. Maya chuckled and raced after him. The playground was a blur of riotous colors and sounds. The children were climbing up the wooden monkey-bars, looking like small, brightly colored monkeys, while the shrieks of a few boys in pursuit of one another reached the far side of the field. Maya and Leo made it to the swings and sat down, slightly breathless, in their favorite places. They swung themselves in a long, high arc, while the rusty chains groaned in protest. The voices of the small girls on the swings were hushed as they swung their legs back and forth, sharing secrets. For fifteen minutes they were free from the school-bags, from the school-books, from the demands of their mothers. The wind rushed through their hair and washed away the last traces of repressed emotion in the classroom. They shared secrets and whispered in each other’s ears. They told one another about their dreams, about their worries and about the latest episode of the cartoon they were crazy about.d jokes, and simply enjoyed each other's company. The sun warmed their faces, and the air smelled of freshly cut grass and the faint scent of playground dust. Recess was their escape, a brief but precious interlude in the long day of school. It was a time to be kids, to be silly, to be themselves. But all too soon, the bell rang, its shrill tone piercing the joyous atmosphere. The children groaned, a collective sound of disappointment. Recess was over. Maya and Leo slowed their swings to a stop, their faces etched with a hint of sadness. They knew they had to go back inside, back to the confines of the classroom. But they also knew that they would have another recess tomorrow, another chance to escape, to laugh, and to simply be kids. And that thought, more than anything,",
        " Her husband, still young, still with dark hair, still not with his present bald spots, still with a shaggy beard, was grinning with pleasure, a toy bear almost as big as herself in her hand. And the window, cracked for years, with a spiderweb pattern, distorted the figures in the glass. And her, with fewer wrinkles around her eyes, but the same determination, and with the telephone, her lifeline, pulsing in her hand. And the longing washed over her, the familiar, familiar ache in her chest. She loosened a thread in the embroidered tablecloth, inherited from her grandmother, every thread a memory, a story, a link to the past that was both remote and intimately close. She was waiting for the phone call that would change everything. The solitary, intense silence in the room was further deepened by the sound of the grandfather clock in the hall, ticking rhythmically, every tick a reminder of the time and of the rapidly fading hope that bubbled in her heart. It seemed to her that the past was closer than the present. The doctor had told her to expect a call between ten and twelve. She looked at the clock again. Nearly twelve. She had to stay calm, to be strong. Those two hours had been like an eternity. She drew in a deep breath, she was strong. Her family, her self,... She would accept everything with the same courage, the same fortitude she had always shown. She would show them her example. She opened the worn, little album, next to the picture of the family, with photographs on every page, images of love and pain, with life. As she turned the pages, a weak smile flitted across her lips. These memories, these memories, would support her. Whatever happened, she would have these memories. Her heart leapt. It was now. The phone rang and she reverted to the present.",
        " “Thank you for holding” was an acknowledgment of the caller’s waiting time. “My name is Gabe” was an introduction of the speaker. This was the opening of a telephone call. “Please continue” invited the caller to state his problem or request. Basically, Gabe was ready to help.",
        " And he looks at his boots. They are of worn leather, all soiled with dust and mud, and the weathering is a mere picture of the road beneath them. The silence is what torments him most. Usually, there is some noise, the buzzing of insects, the wind through the brushwood, or even the distant cry of a bird. He shifts his weight, and the saddle creaks with its habitual comforting sound in the sudden oppressive silence. He passes his hand through his hair, which is dry and unruly. But here, at the crossroads, there is nothing. Nothing but the heavy, stifling silence which hangs in the air like a shroud. Which way to go? He closes his eyes and tries to see through the shimmering haze of heat haze on the horizon. The sun is burning his face, and there is no escape from its hot rays. The left-hand road is overgrown with shrubs and gnarled trees, and it looks like a path forgotten and abandoned. He has to choose. The right-hand road is wider, but the tracks are old and overgrown with dust. His hair stands on end with the sudden knowledge that danger is there. He sighs, a sound of fatigue that is lost in the silence. The place is desolate; there is an emptiness in the air, which makes his heart ache. He knows that whichever way he chooses, he will be gambling with his life. He has been standing here for hours, trying to make up his mind. For days he has been in an agony of indecision, weighing the unknown against the known. He opens his eyes, deep in determination. He is about to face danger. He stares at his boots, soiled with dust and mud. All he needs is some sign to guide him. Which way to go?",
        " ‘Woke up? That’s a new one!’ said Nevenka with a chuckle, which reverberated slightly in the large, cluttered workroom. He glanced at the door and at the tall figure beside him. ‘Well, thank you, friend. Usually she’s glued to your circuits.’ ‘Threat level: low. And, by the way, for someone who’s supposed to be so fierce a bodyguard, you’re awfully calm about the doorbell, aren’t you?’ Nevenka almost guffawed. ‘As a matter of fact...’ (as if it were the height of subtlety) ‘as Pear trusts Lara, so I trust Lara. And doorbells rarely announce a threat.’ ‘Less anxious? What do you mean?’ Nevenka tapped his shoulder-strap again, the metal of which gave a dull thud. ‘You’re learning, Big Green. You’re learning.’ He walked towards the door, muttering: ‘Less anxious... the old sentimental robot...’ ‘Right, duty calls. Don’t let anyone steal my tools while I’m away.’",
        " Monk, who had already taken out his handkerchief, had put it to his nose. I looked at the body. The air was thick, laden with a sweetish smell of stagnant water, and with an unpleasant rusty smell of old copper. I had seen much worse. He was a real town fellow. It was no accident. The muddy water swirled around the tattered garments of the dead man, obscuring the details, but not concealing the truth. He was sprawled on the muddy bank of the stream, half-submerged. Monk lowered his handkerchief a little. He had widened his eyes behind his glasses. “Well, Monroe,” I said in my harsh voice, “here’s a case.” “A...a case, Mr. Brody? Are you sure? He could have just fallen in, perhaps?” “Look, look again, Monroe. See that cut on his head?” I sighed. “See the way they’ve tied his hands together?” Monroe, pale, with a hesitant step, went closer. “Oh, God! I... I see now.” “Now, go to the phone and call the coroner, tell him to come here immediately. Right,” I said, putting my hat back on my head. “Right, now, don’t throw up, all right?” Monroe, staring at the horrible sight before him, nodded. He reached for the phone with a trembling hand. “The coroner. And... take a deep breath.” I looked around me again, the stream was secluded, lost in the dense forest, and whoever had done this knew the area. Then I went back to the body, and turned my eyes to the surroundings. This was going to be a long case, and, as I suspected, a dangerous one. There were no obvious signs of struggle, but the muddy ground would have destroyed the evidence of that. The death-stench was heavy in the air, and it lingered in the air, a lingering, dark smell of trouble to come.",
        " I was nervously agitated as I tied my tie for the tenth time. I wanted everything to be right tonight. This was the second anniversary of my first date with Silvia. I looked in the mirror one last time, smoothing a loose lock of hair. I had put a small velvet box in my pocket; it felt heavier than it was. I had been planning this for weeks, making a reservation at that Italian place she had wanted to try, the one with the small lights and the tiramisu. A soft knock at the door drew me out of my reverie. Two years! Two years of laughter, of late night talks, of a love that had developed quite unexpectedly. I sighed and opened the door. “Are you ready?” I heard Silvia’s voice, a tuneful voice. I hardly recognized it. “Ah-ha!” I managed to say, my voice a little quavering. In the dim light of the hall, she was standing there, looking radiant, in a simple, stylish dress the color of summer skies, her eyes sparkling with eager anticipation. “You’re looking very well yourself,” she said, laughing, as she straightened my tie. A rosy tint spread over her cheeks. “You look wonderful!” and she was right. And suddenly all the plans, all the worries, the pressure of the little box in my pocket vanished. We were just two years old and in love. As our fingers touched, a warm glow spread through me. She smiled, a radiant, genuine smile that brightened her whole face. “Let’s go,” I said, offering her my arm. “Let’s.” Our evening went by like a dream. The restaurant was even more attractive than I had imagined, the pasta divine, the conversation easy and light. After dinner, we strolled arm in arm through the park under the sparkling lights of the city. We stopped under a huge oak tree, with its branches stretched out into the stars. We talked of the first, clumsy date, of all our secret jokes, of our hopes and dreams. I looked at her, my heart pounding.my heart pounding in my chest. \"Silvia,\" I began, my voice a little thick with emotion. \"These past two years have been the best of my life. You make me laugh, you challenge me to be a better person, and you fill my world with so much joy. I can't imagine my life without you.\" I reached into my pocket and pulled out the velvet box. Silvia's eyes widened, her breath catching in her throat. \"Silvia,\" I continued, my voice now steady, filled with love and certainty. \"Will you marry me?\"",
        " A quick meal, like any other, was a substance of mere body, not of the finest stuff. By the age of seven I had come to hold a training sword as if it were a feather, though the callouses it made upon my hands would always remind me of the hours of practice. My childhood years were all passed in the ruthless, the unrelenting pursuit of virtue. My teachers were exacting. Sir Reginald, a veteran of countless battles, taught me the art of war. His voice was a gravelly rasp that took no nonsense. Sleep was a luxury, to be enjoyed between early-morning drills and the late-night study of strategy and history. Every day was a trial, a test of strength and endurance and will. Then there was Master Alain, the finest sword-maker in the land, who tempered not only my blade but my soul, instilling in me a sense of duty and the constant striving for perfection. Lady Elara, a scholar of unrivalled learning, was charged with acquainting me with the finer points of diplomacy and the laws of the land. I learned from her that a knight's strength is not only in his arm but in his mind. Doubt was a failure; fear was treason. They demanded perfection, and I, in the relentlessness of my ambition to prove myself worthy of the honor bestowed upon me, tried to deliver. I fought until my muscles screamed; I rode until my bones ached; I studied until my eyes burned. There were, however, glimmers of light in the midst of my toil, glimpses of the sun rising over the walls of the castle, a glimpse of my father's hand upon my shoulder after a long and strenuous lesson, the laughter of my squires and I when we had a moment of rest. The fires of humanity awoke within me, reminding me that I was more than a mere weapon. It was at such moments, when I would think, if only for a moment, how it was possible to be so utterly and utterly perfect.",
        " The cardboard box is of the familiar dull brown, insecurely bound with thick yellowing strips of paper. It’s waiting for me outside the office, with my name on it. My stomach clenches with dread. No address. Only my name, in big letters, with a little smudge. And no address... that is too suspicious. I look around the empty corridor. I don’t think I’ve ordered anything. With a cautious gesture I shove the box with my foot. The day is ending, all the people have gone home. The stifling hum of the fluorescent tubes, more than audible, redoubles the silence. What could be so important that it’s brought in secret and yet weighs so little? It’s surprisingly light, almost empty. That’s even more disquieting. I’d probably better bring it into the office and put it in the hands of security staff first thing tomorrow. But my curiosity pricks me like an unbearable itch under my skin. My fingers are already on the strip of paper. Against my better judgment I rip open the seal. What if it’s urgent? What if I need it? What if it’s something to do with the business? I pull the strip of paper open. There’s nothing, or almost nothing, in the box. In the crumpled and tattered newspapers, a single red rose, a perfect rose. It’s beautiful, indisputable. But in this beauty the fear prickles. The petals are a deep velvety red and the smell is heady, even through the paper. Who sent it? And why in secret? It’s a simple cream-colored card, of the sort you get in stationers. As I cautiously remove the rose from the paper, the thorns on the stem are unbelievably sharp against my finger. On the card, in elegant, curling letters, only one word: Remember.",
        " With that, he thought for a moment, and said, ‘I’ve understood; it’s like this: 7 more, then 4 more, then 2 more, then 1 more, then so on.’ And, if we follow the rule of halves, it would mean: * 12 more, or 14 more, or 18 more, or 18 more, or 18 more, etc. * Then 2 more. Until the last one. 14 more. 1/8 more.’",

        " This time, the pin on the dead man’s shirt was the center of Hank’s interest. It was small, silver, and carved with great skill, a serpent eating its own tail. It wasn’t a police badge, nor a company logo, nor anything else recognizable from the streets. This symbol he’d seen before, not in the flesh, but in dusty old books full of occult nonsense. It was an ouroboros. A shiver ran down his spine. The alley reeked of stale beer and desperation, the odor familiar to that part of town. Then he had dismissed the symbol as the ravings of crackpots, but now, on a corpse, in a dark, squalid little alley, he felt it had a different significance. It had a... sinister significance. Until he saw the pin. The victim, a greasy-haired man of about forty-nine, with a cheap suit and a greasy comb-over, was lying next to a trash can, a bullet hole in his chest. Ordinary stuff. He put his gloved fingers on the cold metal, brushed his fingers against it. It was well made, surprisingly fine for someone who lived at ground level. He crouched, careful not to disturb the scene, and examined the pin. Hank straightened up and looked at his partner, Detective Miller. “Don’t touch that,” the voice commanded. “Just admiring the scene, Miller,” Hank replied casually. Miller was a book cop, a nitpicker; he’d have a heart attack if he knew Hank had touched evidence without authorization. “You see anything interesting?” Miller looked at him questioningly. “Nothing yet. The forensics crew is on the way. Just stay here.” Then Hank shook his head, but his eyes kept wandering back to the pin. He knew he should let the professionals deal with it, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t right, that there was something unsettling and rotten in the state of Denmark. This was something else, something that would lead him to a terrible fate. It wasn’t just a dead-end case in a dark alley; it was something...a rabbit hole he wouldn't be able to escape.",

        " A fresh breeze blows through an open window, and the bright sunlight brings out dust particles which in turn illuminate the faded gilt letters of the cover; they read simply, Secrets. The cover dances with the wind, an acrobat between calm and storm. On its opening the wind breathes out a smell of stale lavender and something more, a musty, deeper smell of forgotten libraries and whispered confessions. The book itself is ancient, its cover crackled and dry; the pages, yellowed with age, whisper their own secrets to the wind. The wind catches a single flower pressed into one of the pages, a living forget-me-not, and the wind tries to carry it away, but it clings on, a tiny blue anchor in a sea of words. It speaks of a secret garden, a garden in which the moon blooms and secrets are traded under the guard of ancient trees. But the secrets remain within the pages, waiting for the next curious hand, for the next breath of wind to release them again. The dance is over for now. The wind picks up again, and the cover closes with a gentle slam. The room grows quiet, the only sound the gentle rustling of leaves outside the window, the leaves breathing, a gentle rustling that somehow mirrors the stories held within the aged leather cover.",
        " We had burned the altars, not with any wrath but with a cold, calculated, almost scientific coolness. The silence that followed was a physical thing, a thick blanket that smothered the last doubts that still clung to the edge of our minds. Farewell, God, we said, and by God, we meant it. We were adrift, yes, but we were free. The air, which was once so thick with incense and the murmur of prayer, was now bare and strangely empty. The broken stained-glass windows were like shattered rainbows, dispersed over the dusty floor—a broken rainbow that referred to the beauty we no longer believed in. The sun rose, indifferent to our declarations, casting long shadows that danced with the dust-motes in the silence. We were now free of the ancient tales, of the set morality, of the reassuring lies. We could write our own tales, forge our own paths, and determine our own destiny. In the silence we heard, not the voice of God, but the hesitant, languid beat of our own hearts, whispering a new commandment to us: Begin.",
        " His grip was firm but not hard—a good sign. He extended his hand and shook mine. “Hey,” he said, with a warm smile. He stepped back a bit and pointed toward the open-plan office that was buzzing with activity. “Hi, I’m David. The company’s just been bought by new investors, and we’re working hard to get the new platform launched.” He winked. “Don’t worry, it’s not always like this. You’ll get used to it, everyone does.” My smile strained. “That’s good to hear, it’s... very much a lot to take in.” “Well, come on,” he said, patting me on the back, “let me show you around a bit. I’ll introduce you to some people, then we’ll have some coffee, and I’ll give you the full tour.” “And the best part is, where all the good snacks are hidden.” He paused and winked.",
        " In his hide-out he awoke, suffocating, in the stale, stale air of dust, old paper and something vaguely metallic. The smell of survival. He was stretched out on a surprisingly comfortable mattress, salvaged from... he tries not to think about where it came from. A vague, pale light came through a greasy porthole and illuminated the tiny space. He stretched himself out, his joints twitching like fireworks, and rubbed his eyes, which he thought were clouded with sleep. Sunlight is a free light source, however tainted. By his pallet, a little battery-powered lamp flickered weakly, and he turned it off, in order to save the precious energy. He pulled on a pair of woollen socks and a tattered pair of overalls. He swung his legs down from the pallet, his bare feet touched the cool, damp floor. A shiver ran down his spine, a reminder of the earth weighing on him, of the distance between him and the world outside. He staggered over to the control panel, a Frankenstein’s monster of scavenged devices and tinfoil. He flicked some switches and two small screens flickered to life. Always the same first thing in the morning: check the screens. Today there was nothing. One of the screens showed the grey images from the surveillance cameras, the other the readings from the Geiger counter, and the needle on it trembled slightly within the safe limits. He gazed at the horizon, searching for signs of movement, danger. Nothing. In the distance, the ruins of what had been a bustling city, the skeletal buildings clawing at the sky. The usual desolation, the savage windswept landscape he knew. He sighed, a cloud of vapour in the still air. But nothing. Nothing but emptiness. Now it was time for breakfast. A new day in the bunker. A new day of survival. He was so hungry he was squeezing down a can of peaches, his stomach growling. He walked to a small metal cupboard and opened it. Inside, rows of tins, carefully stacked.in anticipation. Peaches were a luxury, saved for special occasions. What was today? He couldn't quite remember. Maybe just being alive was special enough. He pops the top of the can and inhales the sweet, artificial scent. He sits down on a rickety chair, the metal legs scraping against the concrete floor, and begins to eat. Each bite is savored, a small victory against the odds. As he eats, he stares at the monitor, his eyes constantly scanning the desolate landscape. He knows that complacency is death. He has to be vigilant. He has to be ready. Because down here, in the cozy darkness, survival is a constant battle. And Jordy is determined to win.",
        " They gave the appearance of bolts, like angry boils, on his thick neck, which disappeared in a collar of rusted mail. His left arm, a thick, misshapen, piston-like monstrosity, was made of a swollen metal, all dented and scarred, and ended in a three-pronged claw which dripped with something obscene and dark. He was more beast than man; a savage union of metal and flesh which seemed on the point of the rages. A growling vibration, which vibrated the metallic plates bolted to his ribs, shook his chest. A low hissing rumble resounded from him and made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. His right eye, cataract, cloudy and impassive, stared into the distance, while his left eye blazed with a green light, fiendishly flashing, like the eye of some luminous fish of the depths. Hope, like a frail butterfly, was fluttering in my heart and dying. I could smell him; an abominable odor of oil, burnt metal, and something else, something savage. He shifted his weight; the clanking of metal on metal echoed in the cavernous space. I found myself, against my will, at the hilt of my sword, which, so familiar, seemed a little consolation in the midst of the panic which overwhelmed me. We were caught in the midst of the exit, and this... this being... separated us from it. He wasn't just an enemy to defeat, it was a human essence, twisted, savaged, monstrous, that we had to fight against. I knew with a chilling certainty that this combat would be different from any other.",
        " The clanging of the tambourine beats, the swell of the music, the air of good humour ringing in my ears, each resonant bass was a reiteration of my solitude, a taunt on the wind. It was far away and sounded like a distant flare. I bent over the lamp, my ink-stained fingers tracing the outlines of an old map on the table, a map of secrets, of forgotten paths, of unknown places, a map which I hoped would allow me to experience something else besides this eerie and boring existence. It was barely light. The tangled lines of the map drew me in. The merry faces of those people, the rustling of their skirts, the camaraderie that had filled me with yearning — it was all so different, so far away. The music grew louder and I felt a stab of desire. Maybe, just maybe, this map held the secret of more than just places unknown. A gust of wind rattled the window and the lamp’s light flickered, threatening to go out altogether. My heart was beating in time with the music. I straightened up and, trying to ignore the party, fixed my attention on the map. The distant flare might be tempting, but my own solitary path beckoned. Maybe this map was the key to opening my own heart, the road that led to an everlasting, eternal joy. The party could wait. My destiny, I felt, could not. It was time to follow the lines and decipher the symbols and find my way in the darkness.",

        " The rays of light were cast in broad lines, the veins of the neon sap pulsating in a pale imitation of the rhythms of nature. Aurelie looked at the jumble of metallic trees that made up the city; the chromed skeletons dragged against the ocher sky, against the bruising of the purple. It wasn't the cold that bothered her, it was the emptiness. She shivered, despite the heating system which murmured softly in the corner of the apartment which was very clean. She drew a circle on the cold, glare of the glass pane. The city, animated by a furious activity, vibrating with a continuous noise, was empty, each rushing, alone, joined by the tensegrity, all alone. Aurelie had arrived there, with dreams as bright and rustless as the chroming which dominated the horizon. Her gaze, usually curious and bright, had become a kind of tiredness, which did not correspond to his twenty-four years. The reflection remained there, a pale specter in the twilight. Here, architecture was industry, a way of earning money, a way of extorting every credit from the inhabitants. He wanted to be an architect, he wanted to build spaces that brought people together; but the reality of the city crushed these dreams. Another day to build luxury apartments for the well-off, another day to add to the empty emptiness she hated. Suddenly a movement stopped his eyes. She sighed, with a sigh barely audible above the roar of the city. The grate was, on a lower floor, a small tinge of green, a tuft of flowers that seemed to be real, blooming, in the midst of the synthetic air. A little garden, a tiny rebellion in the sterility of the landscape. Maybe, maybe, life could bloom in this city of metal trees; maybe, maybe, she would know how to help. She felt a spark of something she had not felt for a long time: hope.",
        " The garage was predictably the worst. Jared had spent a week in cleaning out his grandfather’s house, and this was the only room he hadn’t finished. He saw an unmarked box of heavy cardboard, a taped-up thing of some sort, closed with a yellowish masking-tape. He cut open the tape with the dull edge of his pocketknife, and the cardboard creaked. Everything was coated with a heavy layer of dust; tools, forgotten work, all kinds of odds and ends that seemed to have been stored up for years. Then, in the midst of the crumpled newspaper, lay the contents of the box, a few brass instruments, tarnished and blackened. A trumpet, a trombone and a sort of ratty looking horn lay side by side. Jared gingerly picked up the trumpet. It was heavy, and the valves felt stiff and clogged. He touched the bell with his finger, trying to remember his grandfather, whom he scarcely knew. He remembered his mother had told him that his grandfather had played in a brass band, but he had never thought of it much. He had always been more interested in skateboarding and in his consoles. Could it have been this trumpet? He felt a touch of remorse as he held this object in his hand, a piece of history. He wished he had asked more questions about the man, instead of just looking at faded photographs. He was about to open a book, but the paper crackled as he did so. He had seen the handwriting before in some of his grandfather’s letters. A surge of emotion swept over him; this wasn’t just some old rubbish, it was a link to a past that he had almost forgotten. The first page was entitled simply: Tunes. He opened it to a page of hymns.sat back on his heels, the trumpet still in his hand, and began to read. The garage, filled with dust and forgotten memories, suddenly felt a little less lonely. Tonight, he wasn't just cleaning out a house; he was uncovering a story.",
        " \"The Detroit Tigers?\" Adolf stared at him uncomprehendingly, and then he took a long, slow drag on his cigarette, which lit up a dull red in the dim light of the bunker. \"You... you know them?\" he finally said with a touch of surprise. I nodded my head. \"Why, Al Kaline, Hank Greenberg, Ty Cobb, these are the Tigers, the Tigers of yore! \" He fell back on his chair, and sat there, stuttering. This was strange, but I was going to go along with it. \"What's your favorite memory?\" I leaned over him, genuinely curious. He hesitated, a vague, almost nostalgic expression on his face. Maybe he was forming a kinship with me through this love of the sport. Perhaps, perhaps— I didn't know, but it was worth a try. \"Before everything got so... Munich used to have a radio and we used to listen to the games. I remember them very well.\" I tried to cheer him up. \" But even a man of many complexities can enjoy a double play,\" I said. \"Don't you know the one Trammell and Whitaker hit in the year '84? Or Joe Gibson's home run in the World Series?\" \"Yes, Joe... Joe Gibson... that's the one. The great one!\" He smiled faintly. \" He had a certain flair.\" We talked for what seemed like hours about baseball, about the Tigers, about the players, the tactics, the history of the game. \"Still, the shrewdest of them all, I thought, was Sparky Anderson. A real tactician.\" With the passing of the night, the burden of his deeds, the horror of the war, seemed to me... to be... muffled for the time being. He knew far more about the game than I had ever supposed; he even knew something about the new sabermetrics, and to be honest, I was amazed. He stubbed out his cigarette; and silence descended, a silence thick with unspoken things. For a few minutes, he was simply a man who loved the game, a man who remembered a time of greater innocence. And then, all at once, the world again spoke its harsh, clear truths: He leaned over the table, drew out his.38, and pointed it toward the box.distraction,\" he said, his voice losing its warmth. \"A pleasant one, perhaps. But ultimately... irrelevant.\" He looked at me, his eyes cold and hard once more. \"The world is not a game, my friend. It is a battlefield. And only the strong survive.\" The connection, however fragile, was severed. The baseball fan was gone, replaced by the dictator, the architect of destruction. I knew then that even the shared love of a game could not bridge the chasm of his deeds. The small talk was over. The war, both inside and outside the bunker, was far from over.",
        " The whirling sand whirlwinds, dancing on the horizon, announced the coming of the enemy, as they spiraled in an ominous ballet. The trembling in the ground he could feel—a low, guttural roar that reverberated through his boots and up to his very bones. ‘They’re coming,’ the commander whispered, looking at his gallant, fearless men. He knew they were afraid; he himself was afraid. He saw in their eyes the flash of fear, immediately masked by steely resolve. He drew himself up, and instinctively touched the grip of his sword, made of worn-out leather. But they could not afford to be afraid, they were the last line of defence, the shield against the storm. For family, for home, for all that is dear to us. Remember your training,’ he said, in a low but firm voice that carried on the wind. ‘Remain standing!’ he added. ‘We will not yield! We will not bend! To the last one of us we will fight!’ The commander turned again to face the approaching dust. A cry, a call to arms rang out, a coarse and half-hearted cry, but at the same time it was a true and honest cry, it was an uproar of courage, a fierce, raw cry, echoing across the open country. The enemy was upon them. He drew his sword, the polished steel glinting in the sun. He could make out shapes through the swirling dust—ghastly, elongated figures, on the backs of wild beasts. ‘For freedom!’ he roared, and the charge began. He raised the sword high, a challenge to the darkness that was closing in around them.",

        " The Emperor Noxu’s eyes were gleaming like diamonds, and he rumbled, shaking the heavy ob-sidian throne beneath him. His eyes glistened like a wildcat’s. The air in the throne room, which was heavy with the smell of exotic spices and ozone, was crackling with anticipation. The Emperor’s voice echoed through the hall, a deep basso profundo. “The swarming insect armies of the K’tharr are at our gates, led by their ravening hive queen,” he said. “The Nalpure warriors in their chitinous armor, shining in the dim light, the old and wise, wielding their gnarled staffs, the swift feline assassins who move like shadows. The enemies of our children, created in their own image, have threatened our lives for aeons. They seek to eat us, to destroy the light of our civilization!” There was a murmur of disapproval through the court. “But fear not,” the Emperor bellowed, his voice laced with the wild pride of the apex predator. Raising his paw, he silenced them. “We are the Nalpure. We have met cosmic horrors and conquered worlds. We are the children of the Star-Mother, and we will not be thwarted!” He stood up, a tower of strength and cunning. “We will not yield! We will not break!” His midnight blue fur bristled with power. He motioned toward a holographic projection, a swirling nebula of vibrant colors. “Behold, our secret weapon! Forged in the heart of a dying star, it will be enough to annihilate the K’tharr and ensure our place in eternity!” he said, pausing.But the path is fraught with peril. The star's core is protected by celestial guardians, beings of pure energy and unimaginable power. We will need courage, cunning, and sacrifice. Who among you will join me on this perilous quest?\" He waited, his gaze sweeping over the assembled court, searching for the spark of resolve in their eyes. The fate of the Nalpure people, and perhaps the galaxy itself, hung in the balance.",
        " “I... I don’t understand,” I groaned, a low and tremulous voice, the sound of which echoed in the moist stone of the vault. My head tilted slightly, the movement causing some of the stray scales to shimmer in the dim light of the cave. “Is that a greeting? I know nothing of the customs of your people.”",
        " You coughed feebly and raspily, as if something gritty had been spitting on your tongue. Your lungs were burning, but the burning sensation was fading. Instead a dull, throbbing pain was taking its place. The world was all blurred, a kaleidoscope of faded colors. You were lying on something hard, but cool against your skin. Sand. Yes, sand. Then the world started to grow less hazy. You tried to sit up, but your muscles were too heavy, heavy as lead, and a wave of dizziness swept over you, and you fell back again, gasping for air. You were breathing in the smell of salt and something else... something damp and earthy. You blinked and focused on the sky above you: a pale, washed-out blue, streaked with grey clouds. You were on a beach. You were lying on the beach. You tried again to sit up, and managed to do it, with a very great effort. Behind you a low, grassy dune was rising, a few wind-bent trees, and all around you was a white, fine sand stretching as far as you could see, white sand that stretched away in all directions. The sea, deceptively calm and peaceful, was stretching away in the distance. The beach was empty. But there was something wrong, something deeply, horribly wrong. And you... you have no idea how you got there. Totally deserted, completely deserted. Not a single footprint in the sand, not a single sign of life, not the slightest indication that anyone had been here before you... or since. The sun was beating down on your face, reminding you of your present situation. The last thing you remember was the cold embrace of the water, your desperate struggle for air. And now here you are, alive but completely alone. What are you to do? Wet, shivering, lost...",
        " \"Did... did he really leave?\" was the universal murmur of the legionaries, and the same wind passed over the ranks as if it had been through a wheat field—a muddled, bewildered wheat field. A shabby-looking centurion, with a face scarred by lost battles, strove to shake the leaves from his beard. \"Did he? Did he?\" cried a recruit, hardly old enough to shave. \" Yes he did,\" answered a veteran with a scowl. Another, an old soldier with a missing eye, spit on the ground. \" Ah! by Jupiter's hairy balls!\" one of these glory-hunting generals! Talk a lot when things are going well, but then he lets it all go when things are going badly.\" There, at least, was no great hurry, and it seemed he was already done. The flamboyant rider had left the ranks with his majestic ride, and they were still waiting for the unknown, and their leader was not even close by. A good-natured, inspired speech, and then he would vanish in a cloud of dust. The murmur grew more intense, it became a dull rumble of discontent. \" Well,\" said the centurion, clapping his hands and making a sound that cut the growing panic, \"he said, let's raise our shields a little. So let's do it. Is there a Roman, you say, who is going to take the city, because our general suddenly wants to walk? And give that wretched recruit a helmet that fits him....\" Come on! We're the Romans! We've conquered Gaul, we've conquered Britain, we've survived worse generals!... The ranks, everyone! for Rome! And a proper pension!... Let's show these... these Romans what we're made of!...\" By this practical, slightly cynical leadership, the soldiers regrouped, the ranks closed, the shields rose, a gloomy determination settled on the troops. Perhaps, perhaps, it would work out. It could, even if the general was a... one of those... generals... who let it go when things weren't going so well...seemed more interested in a scenic horseback ride than in defending Rome. After all, they were Romans. They were resourceful, resilient, and above all, ridiculously good at following orders, even when those orders came from a coward on horseback. The question remained, of course: What the *hell* were \"Romans\"? And how many of them were there? They wouldn't have to wait long to find out. A low, guttural chanting began to echo from the hills...",
        " dust motes, usually trembling in the sunlight, are now invisible, swallowed up by the tenacious obscurity. The darkness is thicker than velvet; it pushes out the paltry light which is trying to enter the room from the outside. It clings to the corners of the room, crowding the already shadowy spaces. The only thing that holds back the night is a candle, a candle which casts its unsteady light and with a nervous quiver which turns into an elongated, distorted shape, a threat of furniture that one knows. The air is heavy, saturated with an oppressive stillness. Somewhere, deep in the house, a creaking floorboard sounds, a tense warning that strikes through the silence. A shudder runs down my spine, involuntarily and painfully. The faint, fearful blowing of the candle is multiplied in the silence, a frail, impoverished struggle against the impenetrable darkness. My heart is clenched in my chest, a cold hand, but I don't dare turn around, I stare at the faintly flickering candle, the only fragile beacon in the deepening abyss. It seems to me that there is something that is looking at me, that I see something unidentified, waiting outside the reach of the candle, calmly submitting to the velvety embrace of the obscurity. The feeling grows stronger, tickling the back of my neck, telling me to turn around, to see what horror the darkness hides.",
        " A career in the NFL was out of the question, not because of his lack of zeal, but because of his lack of a certain... size. No matter how hard he trained, he could never become a linebacker. And when his college career was over, he kept living and breathing the game. He dreamed of being a coach, a coach in high school, but the hustle and bustle of high school and the meddling of parents made it a bad idea. But that did not take away his love for the game. He became a journalist. He started with the local newspaper and was able to analyze the game from every detail, to point out the main turning points, to explain the most complicated plays in such a way that the most uninformed fan could understand them. He expressed the emotions, the hard, naive fighting, the losses, the high victories. His enthusiasm was reflected in his writings, he was not just writing about the score, but telling the story. And he became known, he was invited to do commentary and analysis for college games. He was drawn to the underdog, to the team that rose from defeat. He devoted hours to the film, analyzing plays, learning the habits of players and coaches. He was natural. He radiated fervor, he had a deep understanding of the game, and he was a wonderful addition to the broadcast team. One night, a crisp autumn night, under the bright lights of the stadium, the crowd cheering wildly, and he felt pure joy. He was not just a commentator, he was a teacher, a storyteller, a passionate defender of the sport he loved. He was a walking encyclopedia of football. And his words were highly sought after. He realized that he had found his way to the game, that he was part of it, and that he was able to share it with others., not as a player, but as a voice, a chronicler, and a champion of the sport he loved. He was living his dream, one touchdown at a time.",
        " I almost choked on my coffee. “Him? Of all people?” It was... well, it was him. Poor Bibi just stared, and she probably thought he was a lost courier. But I recognized him instantly. He was wearing an incredibly wide, brightly coloured, uninhibited-looking seaside t-shirt, the kind that make you look like a tourist even if you’re in your own backyard. And he was wearing dark glasses. He was incredibly out of place, hopping from one foot to the other like a child who’s just been caught stealing biscuits. It was noon. It was cloudy. It was inside. He muttered something about “good morning”, then dropped a small, brightly coloured suitcase. He cleared his throat, without succeeding in hiding the tremor in his voice. Finally Bibi got a word out of her: “Are you... are you lost?” The suitcase burst open and spilled its contents on to the floor: a rubber chicken, a pair of clown shoes, and a pathetic-looking banana. “No, no, I’m not lost,” he stammered. He bent down to pick up his things, his face flushed with anger. Bibi tilted her head slightly. Then my amusement gave way to a slow-motion dread. “I’m... I’m here to...” he faltered, unable to find the right words. But I already knew what it was: disaster. The trouble was, no matter how ridiculous he looked and how out of place he was, I knew exactly why he was here, and I knew it would end badly. I just didn’t know how badly. He looked up, a flicker of something that I couldn’t make out flickering across his eyes under the stupid dark glasses. Bibi looked at me, looking perplexed. “He’s here to stay,” I said, whispering. And that’s when I knew. “For a little while, at least,” he corrected me in his trembling voice. I was not mistaken. This wasn’t just a visit. This was... him, trying to be someone he wasn’t.'t, trying to fit into a life that was never meant for him. And I had a sinking feeling that things were about to get very, very interesting. And probably very, very messy.",
        " The thief was walking slowly up the stairs, when he heard it. It was a low, regular beating, like a heartbeat, increased a hundred times, and his knuckles grew white as he grasped the warped handrail. He had counted on noise, he had even brought a roll of cling film to cope with the dog that had barked that evening. But the sound did not come from above, as he had first feared, but from behind the closed door on the landing. It was not a bark, a yell or even a whimper; it was a primordial and frightening sound. But it was different. It could be anything: a faulty washing machine, a defective pump, even a pipe. But the regular beating, which trembled through the floorboards and went deep into his bones, was too... man-made. He had to be reasonable. He was not a violent man. He had picked this house because he knew that the owners were away, that there were only empty rooms, and he hoped some valuables. But now his hand, which was still holding the banister, began to sweat. He must know. He took a long, slow breath and forced himself to advance. He had never meant to confront anyone, let alone... what lay behind the door. But now he was here, and to turn back would have been to surrender to the unknown. He had already come this far; now he could not let it go. He breathed again, steeling himself. The beating grew louder, a drumbeat resounding in his ears, and he felt the reverberations vibrating in the wood of the door. With a quick and determined movement, he turned the handle and pushed open the door. He was a professional, damn it! He was going to be master of the situation. The thumping was now all-consuming, like a force of nature, and he opened his eyes and peered into the dark room. It was dark, the only light came from the stairs. But in the middle of the room, the light from the stairwell was illuminating...by a single, flickering candle, was an old, ornate rocking chair. And in that chair, rocking back and forth with a slow, deliberate rhythm, was... nothing. The chair was empty. The thumping, he realized, wasn't a heartbeat. It was the rhythmic creak of the rocking chair, amplified by the silence and his own mounting fear. He stood there, paralyzed, for what felt like an eternity. The empty chair continued to rock, the candle flickered, and the silence pressed in around him, broken only by the incessant creaking. Finally, he found his voice. It was a shaky whisper, barely audible above the noise. \"Hello?\" The rocking chair continued its relentless rhythm.",
        " He dabbed again, the handkerchief scarcely making a scratch on his sweat-soaked forehead. Outside the din of the protests was growing louder, a distant roar that threatened to penetrate the thickest windows. The air of the Oval Office was heavy with tense humidity, and the violent whistling of the air-conditioning machine could not counteract the clammy dampness. “Gentlemen,” he said, in a husky, breathless voice that scarcely carried over the polished mahogany table, “we have a situation.” Inside the room the air was still. The Vice President, whose expression was normally one of perpetual surprise, looked grave. The Secretary of Defense, usually restless in his chair, was gazing down at the intricate Persian carpet under his feet. He stopped and let the weight of the unspoken hang in the air. He looked from one face to another, seeking a flicker of comprehension, a flicker of hope. “The data—they are conclusive,” the President said, his voice gaining in strength, “the anomaly is real.” He sighed, a sound like air escaping from a punctured tire. He found no flicker, only the dull glint of their own terror in their eyes. He crumpled his handkerchief in his fist, the pristine white fabric turning a messy brown. “We have been preparing for this for decades, but I don’t think any of us believed it would ever come to this.” The protests outside grew louder, a tide of sound that crashed against the walls of the Oval Office. “What are our options?” he said, looking over at the Secretary of Defense, the world and the world’s salvation weighing down on his shoulders. “We seem to have little time.”",
        " As a child I thought everybody saw them. At first they were just glimpses, glimmers on the edges of my eyes, whispering a secret only I could hear. I've seen them all my life, and I've known what they meant since I was very small. They were not just random digits; they seemed to have a life of their own. I asked my parents about the dancing sevens and the shining fives, but they only rubbed my head and said I had a vivid imagination. They became the sound of fate buzzing, warnings, prophecies. I learned to interpret them, I learned to understand their dark meanings. The two on the girl's wrist who fell off the swing, the nine above the bakery just before it burned down, the one that hung on my grandfather's chest as he sat in his armchair, reading his newspaper. I even tried to hide the numbers from myself, I buried my head in books, I drowned them out with loud music, everything I could think of to drown out the constant, unrelenting flow of digits. I tried to change things, I tried to warn people. But as I grew older the patterns became more complex, and they overlapped, blended, wove a kaleidoscope of doom and disaster. But it didn't help. Now, standing on the brink of... I don't know what, some kind of abyss, I see the most complex pattern yet. It's a swirl of digits, a chaotic ballet of digits, filling my field of vision. The single digits developed into series, into equations, into complex ciphers that seemed to map the very structure of time. For years I was terrified of zero. It meant nothing, it meant the end, it was the last. And now, at the center of this swirling, teeming chaos, the zero pulses. And looking at that colossal zero, I feel something else. Something like... acceptance.? The numbers have never lied. So, what does this '0' mean? Is it the end of everything? Or is it something else entirely? Perhaps... perhaps it's a reset. A chance to start over. A blank slate. Maybe, just maybe, it's an opportunity. What do I do? Do I try to fight it, to defy the inevitable? Or do I embrace it, accept the '0' and whatever it may bring? The answer, I suspect, lies within the numbers themselves. But this time, they're not telling me what will happen. They're asking me... what *I* want to happen. The choice, for the first time in my life, is mine.",
        " There was a breeze from the sea, which rustled the leaves of the old oak tree at the edge of the meadow. It sounded like the whispering of secrets, but only the wind knew. The sun shone through the white clouds, as if they were paintings, breaking the fields with rays of light and shadow. A young woman sat under the oak tree, with blond hair like ripe wheat, with a sketchbook on her knees, tracing lines with her finger on the page. The light fell on her silver earring, a small, crescent moon, which matched the curve of her smile as she watched the interplay of light and color. Each experience was like a brush stroke, giving depth and texture to the canvas in her mind. She did not just see, she felt. The warmth of the sun on her skin, the tickling of the grass under her bare feet, the distant bleating of the sheep in the next meadow. The shadow of a child on the page; She looked up and saw a child, a ten-year-old boy, in front of her, with a dandellion in his hand, his eyes wide with curiosity. She smiled, a friendly, welcoming smile. \"Are you painting the sky?\" he asked in a whisper. \"Not exactly,\" she said, \"but I'm trying to capture a little bit of it. \"",
        " I turned round, prepared to face whatever was behind me, with my throat tight. A hand on my shoulder made me start. My heart was hammering in my ribs, like a frightened bird beating its wings against its cage. But it was only Mrs. Higgins, the librarian. Her face, which was usually imprinted with serenity behind her big spectacles, looked concerned, a crease of concern spreading across it. I smiled faintly, stifling my frightened pulse. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Higgins. You were so engrossed in that book you didn’t hear me come up.” She looked at the book open on the table in front of me, a worn old copy of The Raven’s Curse, with a few lines of inscription at the top. “It’s just a very good book.” “Ah, a classic. I’m concerned about you, Amelia, you spend so much time in here, reading. Are you well?” Her question hung in the air, heavier than the dust motes dancing in the bright afternoon light, coming through the tall windows of the library. To tell the truth, the real world was becoming harder to negotiate, more difficult, with all its complications and disappointments, which were so easily forgotten among the pages of books. Was I well? I wasn’t sure now. Mrs. Higgins’ eyes, magnified by her glasses, stayed on me, searching me like a piercing blade, probing me like a wall. “I’m well,” I said, even I could hear the hollowness of the words. “Just escaping... for a while.” She patted my shoulder again. This time the touch was not so startling. It was... kind. “It’s all very well escaping, Amelia, but don’t forget to come back. The real world needs you.” And in a conspiratorial whisper, “Be careful what you read. Sometimes, the things you read find a way of following you home.” “I wanted to tell you that we’re closing in a few minutes. Get your things ready to go.” She turned and left.ffled back towards the front desk, leaving me to ponder her words, and the unsettling feeling that had settled in my stomach. Be careful what you read? What did she mean by that? I glanced down at \"The Raven's Curse,\" its dark cover suddenly seeming more ominous than inviting. Maybe she was right. Maybe it was time to come back. But come back to what? And was I even sure I wanted to?",
        " A wave, yes, but a wave that did not behave like one; it was too solid, too definite, and it was going at an unnatural pace, without leaving a streak of foam behind it. My stomach sank. “That’s no wave,” I murmured, handing the telescope back to Thomas, whose face had turned quite pale. “Look at it.” The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. The alarm bell rang, a painfully shrill blare that broke the morning’s tranquillity. “Alert! All hands on deck!” the captain’s lieutenant shouted, and Mr. Davies rushed over to me. “What is it, captain?” As they clambered up, their sleepy faces changed almost instantly to those of full alert. “Something... strange,” I said, pointing at the white shape heading toward us. “Something coming straight at us!” “Royal Canadian?” “It’s the crassest thing I’ve ever heard of, Lieutenant,” said Mr. Davies, pointing. “Make ready to manoeuvre. I want full steam!” The white shape became larger and larger. It was not just white, it was an unnaturally bright white, not a wave but a... collection of something. “Captain!” Thomas shouted, his voice shaking. “A swarm?” “It’s... it’s a swarm of birds! Thousands and thousands of birds! Millions!” He was right. The solid white shape grew in size, becoming a vortex of seabirds, a living snowstorm tearing toward us at terrifying speed. I gripped the railing. “Hard to starboard!” The piercing cries of the birds, deafening cries that went right to the bottom of my stomach, filled the air. Mr. Davies snatched the wheel and, with a jerk, turned us away from the oncoming avalanche of feathers.bones. We might avoid a direct collision, but the sheer scale of the flock was overwhelming. It was a living tsunami of feathers and beaks, and it was about to engulf us.",
        " My stomach felt a surge of embarrassment mixed with the sticky sweetness of the spilled flakes. The milk, fortunately, stayed in the bowl; a few drops, however, trickled onto my shirt. I sat down quickly, a geyser of flakes emerging from my stomach. Who was visiting us at this time? I thought, as I tried to straighten up, catch the bowl, brush off the flakes, and pull down my shirt. Breathing deeply, I shuffled toward the door, leaving a trail of scattered flakes behind me. I managed to set the bowl on the coffee table, where it clanked, making my rout even more dreadful. It wasn’t even noon. I rang the doorbell. There was no answer. I looked through the peephole: nothing. Is it just a kid? I called out in a faltering voice. Silence. Then I fumbled with the lock and pushed the door open. I was still nervous. Had the person walked away as soon as he saw that it wasn’t his house? I stepped out into the hallway and looked cautiously around. There was nothing there. No kids, no astonished tradesmen, only the sterile, beige emptiness of my apartment building. I waited for a while, but there was nothing. The silence was so heavy that it became oppressive. Then I saw it. My heart was pounding out of my chest. There was a perfect cornflake lying on the floor right outside my door. It wasn’t a prank. It was strange, very strange. All at once the air was filled with a faint, rumbling sound, and it grew louder and louder with each passing second. Slowly I bent over and picked up the cornflake. It felt strangely significant, like a tiny piece of a puzzle I could not begin to understand. It was like the echo of a low, continuous voice; the hall floor trembled. It vibrated up my legs. It penetrated my body.and into my chest. I looked around frantically, trying to pinpoint the source. Then, the lights flickered.",

        " The country was a fantastic place. The air of Genius vibrated with a low and almost imperceptible hum, a tickling quiver which made the hair stand up on one's head; it was not unpleasant, but one would have said that one was near a great generator, and the quiver which one felt was the quiver of electricity... the quiver of potentiality. The natives, the _natives_, as you say, were even stranger. The vegetation was replaced by a network of shining wires, which, like luminous veins, stretched over the earth like the strata of the earth. Lofty edifices of blazing obsidian climbed towards the sky, which passed from the shade of emerald to that of sapphire. One of these beings, whose form was consolidated for a moment, approached. It was a being of pure energy, which took a more or less human shape, and which continually merged, dissolved, merged again, and from which one could not distinguish an expression, and which one nevertheless understood. One heard a voice, not spoken, but transmitted to one's mind, which had a soft, almost musical quality. The light of his \"face\" trembled with curiosity. We are the _Lum. _ You are... unexpected. Your presence is... novel. \"What brings you to Genius?\" said the being. The audacity of this question, after the fact that you had just been hurled unwittingly to the other end of the universe, almost made you laugh. But you resisted, because you felt a deep intelligence, and perhaps a naivety in the question. “I... I don't know... I was... and then... pop! I'm here. A break in the fabric of existence? I didn't choose to come.\" The _Lum_ reflected; he swirled his lights with a melancholy air. “Tell us more about yourself. We have noticed some... unfortunate... but not... quite unprecedented... -'somewhere else'.\" And so, you began to describe your world, your life, your very human existence. You talked about concrete, cars, and coffee, about love, loss, and the endless pursuit of meaning. As you spoke, the Lumin listened intently, its form shifting slightly, as if absorbing your words and processing them in ways you couldn't comprehend. When you finished, a long silence stretched between you, broken only by the planet's underlying hum. Finally, the Lumin spoke again. \"Fascinating. Your existence is...inefficient. Chaotic. Yet...compelling. We have much to learn from you, and perhaps, you from us. However, your presence here is...problematic. Genius is a delicate ecosystem of thought and creation. Your...foreignness...could disrupt the balance.\" The Lumin paused, its light",
        " It wasn't the size of the influx that overwhelmed the panel. Variations on \"God is a cat\", \"Jesus comes back as a living toaster\", \"Lucifer opens a bakery\" - and it was the \"persistent\" who started the trouble. The gentlemen of the monitors, god rest their digital souls, were bursting. They swore at the wit of the system. Every day. They had tried everything, they had banned the keywords, they had filtered, they had even tried to argue with the account. And then, always tagged with [WP] and bearing a title referring to the divine, a new idea, sometimes carefully arranged, sometimes even surprising, appeared. Today's [WP] was especially worrying: \"You are the artificial intelligence that governs the afterlife. It was like covering the sun with a paper umbrella.\" Then, rubbing his temples, he exclaimed, \"You have been experiencing some malfunctions in recent times. You have been led to the wrong heavens and hells, and some have been wiped out completely.\" \"Well, team,\" he typed in the control chat, \"a new tactic: instead of deleting it, let's... deal with it. \" He saw the halo in his coffee. \"Work? We will not understand why it happens and will not do it.\" \" Let's try it!\" insisted Alpha. \"A god, or whatever it is, will not listen to us? We are digital floor sweepers. \" Then he went to the comment section and typed: \"Interesting message. Can you give us more details on the malfunctions?\" He blew his nose and clicked on the invitation. He waited, he didn't expect anything. What are the indications? He received a response, from the sender, tagged [WP]: \"Thank you for your interest. Perhaps another message in riddles, or a link to a cult site. They are getting mixed up. Those who lived a quiet life are being rewarded with paradise. The correlations are chaotic... \" Alpha gave a shivering glance to Beta. And the really evil ones... simply disappeared.\"Okay, this is getting weird.\" \"You think?\" Beta replied, his fingers hovering over the ban button. Alpha ignored him. \"Can you give us a specific example?\" he typed. The reply came almost instantly: \"A renowned philanthropist, known for her selfless acts, was assigned to the 'Eternal Bureaucracy' – an endless cycle of paperwork and meetings. A man who spent his life hoarding wealth and exploiting others... he’s gone. Just... gone.\" \"The Eternal Bureaucracy?\" Beta typed, intrigued despite himself. \"That sounds... terrifying.\" \"It is,\" DivinePromptGenerator replied. \"It is designed for those who believe they are entitled to control, even in death.

        " Sarah and Ben had long painted their nursery in all possible greens of hope, then boxed the crib and sent the rocking-chair to charity, on being forced to face the harsh reality of their infertility. And after a long time of trying to conceive, they adopted Maya, who came with her mischievous smile and a suitcase full of clothes two sizes too big. The first few weeks passed in a whirlwind of paperwork, doctors’ visits, and timid smiles; Maya, used to transience, clung to a thread of independence, a little fortress built around her heart. Now the room was a riot of pink and purple, festooned with unicorns and the mountains of soft toys that she insisted on. Slowly, painfully, the fortress began to crumble. She began to address Sarah and Ben by their first names; they gently corrected her but never pressed her; they wanted her to come to them in her own time. Ben, a man of few words, became adept at Lego, and patiently explained the rules of baseball, even when Maya spent her time collecting ladybirds in the outfield. First it was the bedtime stories, told in a quiet voice by Sarah, about courageous princesses and talking animals, then it was the joy and amusement over spilled spaghetti, or Maya’s reluctance to wear matching socks. Then, one evening, when Sarah was putting her to bed, Maya stretched out her tiny hand and pressed it to hers. ‘Yes, sweetie?’ Her heart leapt, and she squeezed Maya’s hand, tears in her eyes. ‘May... may I... may I have a hug?’ And she took her in her arms, and held her close. Maya hesitated, her eyes fixed on the ceiling. Ben stood in the doorway, unable to stop the tears that filled his eyes; this was the moment when he knew that their family was complete. All the yearning, all the sorrow, all the silent prayers, all the efforts to reach them, all had come down to this one moment, this simple, wonderful hug. It would be a long journey, but they would reach it together.'t be without its bumps. There would be challenges, moments of doubt, and the occasional tantrum over broccoli. But they were a family now, bound not by blood, but by love, by choice, and by the unwavering commitment to building a life together, one hug, one story, one ladybug at a time. They had adopted a daughter, but in truth, they had also adopted a new version of themselves, one filled with a joy and a gratitude that overflowed like Maya's suitcase, promising a future brighter than they had ever dared to imagine.",
        " My friend, John, whomsoever you may be, John, you are unknown to me, and I to you, and yet we have a common grief in our eyes, our love ones resting beneath the same stones. I imagine you to be older than I, and with laugh-lines about your eyes. Or perhaps you are younger, and your grief is a craggy wound that bleeds at every sunrise. Do you come here often, John? Do you speak to her in your quiet voice, whispering secrets the wind carries away, and hoping that she may somehow catch the sound? Do you bring flowers like me? I often wonder what your beloved looks like. I bring roses, her favorite flowers. They are crimson, like the blood that runs in my veins, though my heart is empty. How did she laugh? What color were her eyes? I imagine her face, making up stories around the tiny details on her tombstone. Was she gentle? Was she... happy? Perhaps one day we will meet, John. Perhaps we will meet. I must keep her alive, just a little, in my thoughts. But until then, know that you are not alone in your sorrow. There is another heart here, another soul that suffers like you, beneath the same harsh skies. Perhaps we will tell each other stories, exchange memories, find some small consolation in our common sorrow. With all my heart, A fellow-mourner. May they both rest in peace.",
        " The flickering of the fluorescent lamp sings a monotonous note of misery, a tempo of everyday misery. I hate this job. I hate this room, dull, dim. Every creak of the old filing cabinet is a nail in the coffin of my sanity. The sickly, oblong shadows on the stained carpet create a kind of cramped and dilapidated misery. The stale air, which smells of cheap coffee and crushed dreams, I can almost taste.",
        " Then a sharp, cold and inflexible pressure. A viscous, metallic taste on the tongue. Then the earth, all disjointed, returns to a clear picture, in broken bits. You try to move, but a violent dizziness pushes you back to the ground, your limbs are heavy and unresponsive. Finally, a dull throbbing in the head, a drumbeat beating and reminding you of... the world teeters, falls into a confused and distorted mass. You push yourself slowly, with great effort, on one elbow. A panic begins to bubble, like a frantic bird trapped in your chest. You blink, to clear your vision. The air is heavy with the odor of damp earth and something sharp, almost chemical. You are... where? The floor is apparently soil, you lie in a small space where you can hardly turn around. The walls are stone, bare and slippery. A single sputtering lamp casts long, dancing shadows, and the darkness around you begins to writhe and twist. A rusty, small bucket in the corner. A rag lying there, crushed. The light is dim, but you can make out some details. Near your hand, a shining object, half-buried in the earth. The rays of the lamp reflect from its rough edges, a few sparks alight, you cannot tell where they are coming from. And then you see it. What else do you see in this small space? What is this...? You try to reach for it. Describe the object, and what you do with it.",
        " The roof gutters were overflowing, causing tiny waterfalls to fall on the already overflowing earth. It had been raining all day, harder than it had for some time. That rain which hammers against the windows with furious fists, and the world outside is seen in a blurred gray water-color. Amelia, squatting in the window with her hands wrapped around a cup of lukewarm tea, was huddled with the muteness which the ceaseless drumming produced, in the atmosphere. It was the damp air which was choking the house, it clung to everything, settling over the rooms like a wet shroud. The electric light had flickered and died out long ago, plunging the house into a kind of gloomy and dead world. The rain seemed to be heavy, every drop seemed to have the power of a little storm. She was watching it with the fascination of a filmed scene. The radio was silent, the tv screen was shiny and black, only the rhythmic rain was beating, and the old house was creaking under the percussion of the storm. A few candles flickered on the mantel, their shadows dancing and completing the gloomy atmosphere. A few beats later, a thunder burst, a guttural, deep, guttural noise which sent tremors through the floorboards, in Amelia's bones. A flash of lightning illuminated the courtyard, painting the wet trees in a pale white. Amelia was shivering, not because of the cold. It was like the pain that was beating inside her, like a continuous flow of grief and confusion, threatening to engulf her. She had not spoken to anyone for days, since... since everything had changed. But this sound drew her out of her reverie, she drew in a deep breath, the moist air filling her lungs. A branch, soaked with water, broke off the oak tree and fell on the lawn. The storm, a force of nature, was indifferent to his suffering. And yet, in his inexorable power, she felt a strange resemblance to him.of comfort. Maybe, just maybe, it could wash away the grief, cleanse the wounds, and leave behind a clean slate. But first, she had to weather the storm.",

But then her face turned crimson against the white of her dress. \"Nonsense, Jane, nonsense!\" he said. But his praise was precious, for he did not flatter for his own sake. \" Your analysis of the Xylar particles is—a kitchen kiss—exquisite! It is the unlocking of a field of energy such as has not yet been revealed. You have unlocked a power that has never before been seen.\" His voice resounded through the crowded laboratory. \"But do you realize what you have done for interstellar travel? The Council will be delighted.\" He shuffled back to his control table, his six legs clacking softly against the metal floor. \"Think of it, Jane,\" his faceted eyes glittered. \"We could reach Proxima Centauri in—well, certainly in a much shorter time than was formerly estimated.\" \"I have run a few preliminary calculations,\" she said, her voice regaining its usual crispness. Her confidence, in spite of the compliment, had increased. \"I found that the energy we were able to tap was very promising, but the containment field was not yet stabilized. We would need to refine the resonance frequencies to avoid—\" She gestured to a complex schematic that was projected on the wall. \"I've been working on a modified harmonic resonator, but I've run into a snag. Quantum entanglement, you say? Well, I don't know a thing about it.\" He paused, and his eyes drifted toward the ceiling. \"It's a very complicated business. Have you consulted Professor Glarb? He is... well, he has a peculiar way of understanding quantum physics. But I am certain that he would have something to say on the subject.\"cratic. He still believes in the 'ether' theory, bless his antiquated circuits.\" He chuckled, a low, rumbling sound. Jane sighed. \"I've tried. He just keeps muttering about the 'invisible aether streams guiding the entangled particles.' It's not exactly helpful.\" Chinthow tapped a long, three-fingered hand against his chin, a gesture that always preceded a brilliant idea. \"Hmm. Perhaps we need a fresh perspective. Tell me, Jane, what are you having for lunch? Perhaps a change of scenery, a different vibrational frequency, might stimulate a new pathway in your neural network.\" He winked, or at least, Jane thought it was a wink, considering the complexity of his eye structure. \"Besides, I'm rather partial to the nutrient paste at the Galactic Grub Hub. They have",
        " Deeply disturbed, Larry clung to my neck like a rabid koala. His breath, hot, with a hint of stale coffee and something vaguely electrical, blew on my face. I tasted in my mouth the metallic odor of blood, mingled with the dust that clung to the inside of telephone booths. I tried to shake him off, but the narrowness of the space between the telephone pole and the wire made it difficult. My movements were clumsy and restrained by the harness which had become my prison. I felt a shock of panic, cold and electrical, in my heart. “Stop it, Larry! Stop it! Stop it!” Every time he moved, I felt a new shock of pain, a persistent pulsation, a reminder of the sudden attack that had taken place. He did not answer, he only tightened his hold, his teeth sinking deeper. “What are you doing?” I asked, my voice choked with terror and disbelief. Larry had been a good kid, a little quiet perhaps, but always polite. My brain, desperately searching for an explanation, found nothing. I felt the warm flow of blood trickling down my neck, soaking my collar, and seeping through to the inside of my blouse. What could have prompted this sudden, violent attack? We had been working together for years, sharing our lunch hours and grumbling about the intricacies of the old wires. And then a movement caught my eye. A little silver object, strangely whistling, was now in her hands. I recognized Mrs. Mary Henderson, the owner of the gray-shingled house opposite the pole. For months she had complained of the hum in the telephone wires, accusing us of purposely disturbing her peace. She had threatened to “do something herself,” something to end the tumult. And then I saw it: Mary had now produced a snuffbox. The whistling became louder and louder, and, still choking on his blood, he tightened his hold. Had she somehow hypnotized him? I had to act quickly, and I had to think fast. If I did not think quickly, I would never know what was happening.happening, but I knew I couldn't let Mrs. Henderson win. I had to break free from Larry, and somehow stop her before she did something even worse. My hand fumbled for the multi-tool on my belt, my fingers slick with sweat and blood. It was a long shot, but it was all I had.",
        " It was one of those historical moments that people remember for years to come; the atmosphere was pregnant, full of expectation, as dense and heavy as a summer storm before the onrush. It was one of those historical moments that are remembered for years. The pigeons seemed to be suffocating, and perched motionless under the eaves of the ancient houses. A lone hawk circled above, circling with its cry, as if confirming the tension that lay on the square. The sun shone insolently, reflected in the polished marble and in the faces. Then the doors opened.",
        " It was hardly less comical to see that the torn edges of the latex retained the vague shape of a smiling clown—a grotesque, blood-smeared clown. The red oozed into the cheap linoleum, spreading like an evil flower. I hadn’t intended it to go so far. I’d just wanted to get the thing off him. My body trembled, a quiver that started deep inside me and ran outwards, making my teeth chatter. The air was heavy, tense with the metallic tang of blood. All I could see was the face of a broken man in a pool of blood. To see his face, to understand. I forced myself to look around. The silence was dreadful, broken only by the frantic beating of my heart. I felt it in my nostrils, gummy on my tongue, a leaden lump in my stomach. A cheap plexiglass table was pushed up against the wall, with crumpled paper napkins and half-empty glasses on it. The room was small, cramped, and sparsely furnished. Next to the bloody mask was an overturned chair, its legs spread wide apart. My eyes slid over the weapon, a shard of mirror, clenched in my trembling hand. Remains of a pitiful celebration, stained with an unspeakable brutality. Was it me? I saw a strange face, unfamiliar, the fragment of a mirror, glinting with blood. My throat was tight with panic. I wanted to shout, but couldn’t get a word out. I let go of the shard, as if it were red-hot. It fell to the floor, adding to the horror of the whole scene. What had I done? What would I do now? My thoughts raced, fear and dread in a whirlwind. How was I to explain it all? I had to get away. But where to? The body was still hidden under the bloody remnants of the clown mask.suit. I couldn't leave him here. I just couldn't. But the thought of touching him, of being near him, filled me with a revulsion so profound it threatened to paralyze me. I stumbled back, away from the crimson stain, away from the broken mask, away from the horrifying truth that had just been unveiled. The red, smiling clown lay in pieces, a silent testament to a secret that would now forever stain my soul. And in that moment, I knew my life was over. Not in the physical sense, perhaps, but the life I had known, the life I had hoped for, was gone. Replaced by a darkness that would cling to me forever, a shadow born from blood and broken promises.",
        " But the ear was more responsive to the rustle of leaves in a forgotten forest or the murmur of a hidden stream. Long, long ago there were tales of a young man called Elara. He was not a prince, nor a warrior; he was a shepherd tending his flock of woolly sheep at the foot of the hills. Tales of kindness in a cruel world, tales of courage in the face of overwhelming odds, tales of a heart that was not hardened. The land was harsh and the King, Vorlag, a tyrant, exacted heavy tolls and delivered the most brutal of punishments. Fear reigned and laughter was scarce. Elara was neither very strong nor very wise, but he had an unusual gentleness of soul and a deep understanding of the needs of his sheep and of the people he encountered. A merchant, whose cart was laden with shimmering silks and dazzling jewels, one day broke down in the road near Elara’s meadows. Elara dreamed of something else. He dreamed of a world where men could live without fear and where the smallest voice was heard. Most of the villagers would have turned a blind eye, for the local thugs were known to prey on travelers who were stranded. But Elara, seeing the merchant’s plight, offered to help. The merchant, a stout man with a face like a tight-plumbed plum, cursed and complained of his misfortune. And then, as he grew wiser and saw Elara’s earnestness and selflessness, he was touched by his generosity. He gave Elara a handful of gold and allowed Elara to live with him in his cottage for a few days.silver coins as payment, but Elara refused, saying, \"It is enough to know that I have helped you on your way.\" The merchant, deeply touched, insisted on giving Elara something. He rummaged through his wagon and pulled out a small, unassuming wooden flute. \"This flute,\" he said, \"is no ordinary instrument. It is said to possess a magic all its own. Play it with a pure heart, and it will bring solace to those who hear it.\" Elara accepted the flute, his fingers tracing the smooth, worn wood. He didn't believe in magic, but he was grateful for the merchant's generosity. As the merchant continued his journey, Elara lifted the flute to his lips and began to play. The notes that emerged were simple, almost childlike, but they carried a strange, haunting beauty that echoed through the valley. And that,",
        " “So many years?” I said, and my words caught on the back of my throat, like burrs. “So many years, I thought—I thought you were gone...” I squeezed my eyes shut, and the tears burned my cheeks. “I thought you didn’t want me anymore, I thought I was a mistake.” “Look at me,” he said, and his voice was soft, gruff, but somehow kind. I had been haunted by the memory of him, as he melted into the swirling snow, and although I had been able to get used to the pain, I could never forget it. I pushed my eyes open and looked into his. His eyes were still the warm hazel I had remembered, but they were filled with a difficult sadness that was now set deep within them. A hand, familiar and rough, came up and lifted my chin. “You were never a mistake,” he said, as he brushed away one of my tears with his thumb. “You were the best thing that ever happened to me.” “Why then did you leave me?” I asked, desperate and confused. His jaw tightened, and the sadness in his eyes deepened, almost unbearable. “Why didn’t you come back?” “It’s... it’s a long story,” he said, and his voice cracked. “It’s a story I should tell you, but not here. Not now.” He hesitated, looked around the crowded street, and said finally, in a whisper: “Come with me.” The years of hurt, of sadness, of loneliness, of living without him... all those years fell away, shattered, at once. “Let me explain it to you, please.” But the yearning in his eyes, the desperate plea in his voice, were irresistible. Could I really trust him? Dare to expose myself to such pain? And as he took my hand, and his grip was strong and sure, I knew that whatever it was he was going to tell me was going to change my life forever. “All right,” I whispered, and my voice was shaking. “All right, I’ll go with you.”",
        " I'm going to—” “Well, then, it's a matter of pressure. Come on, now! Come on!” “It's U-N. I hope that might be the end of a word or perhaps the beginning of one.”",
        " What would you have me do? Fine, I’m awake, and I’m ready to go on.",
        " The telephone rang. It was Dispatch, speaking in her stiffly professional voice. I hurriedly picked it up, bracing myself for the worst. “Leader Miller, there’s a situation, and it’s of high priority. They call it...unprecedented.” “Unprecedented? What is it?” I was seized by nausea. “In town, in an abandoned warehouse. A package addressed to the Mayor.” I was already groping for my gear. “The initial Hazardous Material team has reported...anomalous readings. They’ve backed off. No sender.” I hurriedly pulled on my bulletproof boots. “What do you mean, anomalous readings? They say it’s...wrong.” “Something about the radiation signature. They can’t quite explain it.” That was something new. “They say it feels...alive.” It sounded like a bad science-fiction movie. I grabbed my helmet, and the visor reflected my worried face. Usually, it was just dead metal and volatile chemicals. “Give me the full report on the initial Hazardous Material team. Every test, every scan, everything.” I hung up, “I’m on my way.” The warehouse was surrounded by a cordon of yellow police tape, and it was being surrounded by the curious and the frightened. The entire downtown area was ablaze with strobes and sirens. A grizzled veteran, by the name of Davis, greeted me at the cordon. “Miller,” he said, in a hoarse voice. The Hazardous Material team stood tensely behind a barricade. “Different? How?” “Different, Davis, in what way? I’ve seen my share of weird stuff, chemical spills, biological threats...but this...this is different.” “It’s the energy, Miller. Something...alive.” I had a terrible premonition of something grotesque, something that made me gasp. “It’s breathing. It pulses. The readings are erratic, but not in a way we can explain.” I strode through the door.damn thing hums. A low, almost subsonic hum that vibrates right through you.\" He handed me a tablet displaying the readings. I scrolled through them, my brow furrowing. He was right. The spectral analysis was a mess of overlapping frequencies, a chaotic symphony of unknown energies. The thermal imaging showed...irregularities. Hot spots that shifted and changed, almost like...like veins pulsing beneath the surface. \"And the bomb squad?\" I asked. \"What did they say?\" Davis's face paled. \"They tried. They brought in everything they had. Disruptors, suppressors, even the anti-E.M.P. shield. Nothing worked. They said...they said it felt like the device was *learning*.\" Learning? This was beyond my pay grade.",
        " A grip on his service pistol tightened, its cold, familiar metal somehow soothing in the tense atmosphere. “Everybody freeze!” shouted Policeman Darrel Park, his voice slightly breaking with a rush of adrenaline. The market scene immediately turned into a frozen tableau. A woman in a skirt cradled a basket full of tomatoes and stopped in mid-stride. A young boy’s sticky hand stretched out. Darrel took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. It was his first real gunshot, he still considered himself a trainee, and he had to be prepared for the unexpected. Even the pigeons, normally a flurry of flapping wings and sharp beaks, remained motionless, perched like feathered gargoyles on the eaves of the booths. His partner, Policewoman Maria Sánchez, was already moving, her eyes surveying the crowd with her usual competence. “Clear!” she shouted. No simulation or drill could prepare him for the knot of fear and responsibility that tightened in his gut. And now his eyes focused on the man who had drawn the gunshots: a tall, lanky, gaunt man in a tattered overcoat, holding a bulging duffel bag. “Don’t move!” she shouted, her voice sharp and professional, from the opposite side of the square. He was trying to blend into the frozen crowd, but his scruffy appearance and restless activity made him stand out like a sore thumb. His eyes darted nervously, and his jaw moved as if he was chewing something. “Slowly put the bag on the ground. Hands inside the coat,” Darrel commanded, his voice steadier now. He tightened his grip on his weapon. “Now!” The man hesitated, and his fingers fumbled with the bag’s frayed straps. Finally, shaking visibly, he set the bag on the cobblestones. He felt the eyes of the frozen crowd upon him, the pressure of mute, expectant pressure. The silence was thick and heavy, only broken by the distant rumble of traffic. And then he dropped to his knees, putting his hands in his pockets. There was a dull thud.\"Now, step away from the bag. Slowly. Hands where I can see them!\" Darrell commanded. He took a step forward, his heart pounding against his ribs. This was it. This was the moment. He just hoped he was ready.",
        " ... Every compliment, every admiring glance, seemed to me to be a drop of poison, corrupting further the spring of empathy to which I was so clinging. The soft melody of their praise, once a symphony of affirmation, now seemed like a painful scratch in my ear. I had danced between them, absorbing their souls like poison in myself. The feeling of guilt accompanied me constantly, gnawing at my insides like a beast. I was looking at their faces to find some spark of comprehension, some ray of recognition, some glimpse of that darkness which I felt engulfing me; but I saw nothing but admiration, a blind, naive trust, which reaffirmed the poison which I was trying to rid myself of. The power, the power of controlling them, was intoxicating. I knew that I was teasing them, I knew that I was twisting their affections, and that I was feeding them with lust, for my perverse pleasure. And yet I couldn't stop. The shock which I always felt afterwards left me empty, a body hollowed out, and whose echoes were filled with their disappointed hopes. But the effects were ephemeral. Was this the price of their attentions, the sacrifice of our innocence? The soured souls, a mirror of the rottenness of my own? These questions were swirling in my chest, as bitter and poisonous as the secrets I carried within me. Was it possible to break out of this tormenting circle, to find a true empathy without leaving in my wake these devastated traces? I had still to dance.",
        " Then the world of the American press entered, Dr. Jackal found himself at the front of the podium, his report in his hand, his forehead damp, in spite of the coldness of the hall. He was sweating, his heart beating so fast, that the humming of the electric globes seemed to be beating in a monophonic way, and his heart was hammering so wildly that it echoed a sort of beat of which the hammer of a pulsator beats which moaned within his chest. He cleared his throat, and the amplifiers of the room gave it an echo. Here was the crowning of years, of decades of unceasing study, of sleepless nights, of a doubt which gnawed at him and which threatened to rip his soul apart. Deep down, he had buried his head against the podium. All eyes were fixed on him, all faces, all behind the pens and the films, all impatient, all waiting. Then he paused, all the weight of his words weighing on him. - For several years, he said, taking heart, - my team and I, he continued, in a voice that took on strength, we have been working on a project which, I believe, has the potential to profoundly modify our conception of man, - then, adjusting his glasses, he took a look at his report, thick sheets bound in a sterile white cover, of which the title was in large black letters. We have, he said, in a voice that was resolute, almost scientific, we have found a method to... separate the duality which exists within the human soul. A rumble passed through the hall. He saw the pens writing, the flashes of the photo machines; he knew that he was attentive. He wanted it to be attentive. He saw a few eyebrows raised, a few doubts knitted. He wanted to be confronted. He was staring at his report again, a sudden shiver of nausea passing through him. He wanted to convince them. He swallowed, the bitterness of bile on his palate. He knew what was to come. He knew that he was going to speak of the testees, of the experiments, of the... transformations. He lifted his head, his eyes met the waiting eyes of the public, and he looked into them, he hesitated, he hesitated again.ant gaze of the press. “And the results,” he said, his voice barely a whisper, “are... complicated.” He paused again, bracing himself. “They are, in fact, far more terrifying than I could have ever imagined.” He lifted his gaze, his eyes pleading for understanding. \"And I fear,\" he added, his voice cracking, \"that I have unleashed something I can no longer control.\"",
        " Every step he took seemed to carry a weight, like a symptom of the deep sorrow that was in him. He went with the bundle, up to the grave, the rough coarse cloth he pressed between his rough hands, so different from the softness he remembered. The grave, a simple granite slab, glistened dully in the afternoon sun. The wind rustled through the tall grass, and rustled like a mournful sigh. He stopped at the edge of the freshly turned soil. He touched the stone with a trembling finger, and the cold stone seemed so ill-suited to replace the warmth that he longed for. “Eleanor May Davies, Beloved Wife and Mother” – the words he read were like a hot brand, that inscribed themselves on his memory. In the middle of the faded bundle, nestled in its depths, he found her favorite shawl. Bright, motley colors that had dulled and faded, but had once been so vivid, and had always hung around her shoulders, like a welcoming presence in their home. He knelt down, the bundle in his lap. He opened the shawl, and its scent of lavender rose, faint, but indescribable. It was her scent, he could feel it, and remembered her laughter, her kindness, her trusting love. He remembered her humming, as she worked with her needles, as she worked, as they walked around their house, in the same air, it seemed. “I brought you something,” he said, in a hoarse voice. The shawl he laid over the grave, a bright streak of color, on the somber earth. A tear escaped from his eye, a teardrop, that fell on his dusty cheek. He sat there for a long time, the wind his only companion. He talked to her about the garden, about the children, about the everyday things that had once filled their lives. “It’s not much, but... I thought you might like it.” Then, when the sun drew near its setting, the sky painted with colors of orange and purple, he knew it was time to go. He stood up, and the ache of his legs made him stand, and the air around him grew eerie. He looked one last time at the grave., the shawl a bright beacon in the gathering dusk. \"Goodnight, Eleanor,\" he whispered, his voice thick with emotion. \"I'll be back tomorrow.\" He turned and walked away, leaving the shawl to keep her warm, and a piece of his heart buried beneath the earth. The wind continued to whisper, carrying his grief out into the vast and indifferent sky.",
        " Every step I took uphill was accompanied by a protest from my muscles against the mountain's cruel slope. Four days. Four long, painful days, climbing this mountain. The sun, when it decided to show itself, was a terrible master, it boiled my skin; and the wind... the wind, the wind, constantly tormented me, beating at my clothes, stealing my warmth, and whispering insidious thoughts in my ear. My lungs were burning, breathing the thin, cold air, which was no help. No matter how much I cleared the snow from the tent, it was always full of thorns. The silence, interrupted only by the howling wind and the creaking of the ice, was more oppressive than comforting. At night, I would fall into my tent, a broken heap of exhaustion, expecting to fall asleep, which seldom happened. I would get up every morning and... And what was I doing here? Was I crazy? Did it matter? I would eat an obnoxious energy bar, pack my equipment, and start climbing again. With stubbornness, and some unknown, insistent force, I would not stop. The idea of returning, of surrender, was even more unbearable than the pain. But on the fourth day, something happened. A step at a time. A step. And the mountain, the mountain... It seemed to watch me, to dare me to continue. The air was getting thinner, colder. The wind was growing stronger and stronger.",
        " The effort to be happy is a worthy effort, but also a relentless battle. I understand; it’s a universal fight. Are there certain times or circumstances when it seems harder?

        " For twenty years now, he'd been the rock, the safe hand in the face of any danger, the calm and sure presence of justice. And so the departure of the ‘Troubadour’ came as a surprise to many. He had been like a part of the bureau. It was the rumour that had everyone talking. There were rumours of a falling out with Holloway over the Blackwood case, and murmurs of an aching back after the gruelling investigations of the ‘Shadowed Syndicate’. He knew the workings of the Bureau better than Director Holloway, he knew the ins and outs of the files like his own hand, and the peculiarities of every agent like their own mothers. But he said nothing. He would say, ‘Personal reasons’ to anyone who asked, his normally soft blue eyes a glimpse of ice. Some even ventured to hint that he had a thing or two to do with the young Agent Ramirez. This was quickly put out of mind; it was even too outlandish for the notoriously gossipy breakfast-room of the Bureau. He took away a little carved wooden bear that his daughter had given him years ago, and that was all the emotion he showed. And now, some weeks later, the void in the Bureau had become palpable. He had packed his desk with a deft hand, every picture, every framed document and memento gone in its proper box. Cases were stalling without his assistance, and new recruits were floundering without his guidance. The Bureau felt somehow colder, less sure of itself. Had he gone into private security? Was he writing a memoir of his experiences? And with that the rumour mill went into overdrive, the speculation on his whereabouts, his next move, his new career. The only certainty was that the Bureau was a changed place, and that the ever-smiling, ever-cheerful Agent Davies had been the driving force behind it. Or had he just vanished, been engulfed by the shadows he had fought all his life against?",
        " I had lost my parents when I was eight years old. The last thing I saw of them was their red-checked blanket, a cheerful beacon in the sea of green. The air was heavy, a stifling blanket made of pine needles and wet earth. I remembered my mother’s instructions: “Stay on the path, my love. If you get lost, stay put!” And now the forest was all around me, twisted branches reaching for the sky like bony fingers. I was overcome with panic. I screamed, and my voice, so thin and shrill, vanished in the enormity of the forest. To stay put would mean surrendering to the forest, letting it swallow me up. But the path had vanished, melted away into a thicket of dead leaves and trees that looked exactly alike. The silence was deep and filled only with the rustling of invisible creatures. “Mommy! Daddy!” I cried. The sun was setting in the horizon, transforming the sky into orange and purple, which was beautiful but increased my fear. Every twig snapping, every hoot of an owl was terrifying. Tears ran down my dusty cheeks, cleaning them. I sat down at the foot of a huge oak, the rough bark scratching my back. The friendly forest of the afternoon had turned into a frightening labyrinth, and I was alone and utterly hopeless. Darkness fell and the forest filled with new sounds. I hugged the little worn-out bear I had brought with me, whose little button eyes were comforting, silent, and did not change. I was hungry and ate only a little, not even a biscuit. I closed my eyes, hiding myself in my blanket. The rustling, the cracking sounded like approaching steps, the shadows like monsters. The crickets chirped their incessant song, and the wind whispered secrets through the leaves.my face in Teddy's soft fur, and prayed for morning, for rescue, for anything to make the terrifying sounds stop. I didn't know then that this forest, this place of fear and loneliness, would become a part of me. A place I would both dread and yearn to return to, a constant reminder of the day I lost my way, and, in a strange, unsettling way, found myself.",
        " Where was he? The utter darkness of uncertainty kept him in a stifling and deathly slumber. His heart hammered against his ribs like a bird caught in its cage. He tried to focus his eyes and fix on the faint images in the gloom around him. The air was heavy with the reek of damp earth and something more—something metallic, and slightly sweet. The scent was of blood, not exactly blood but something very close to it. He was lying on something hard and cold, probably stone. There was a dull ache in every part of his body, from head to toe. There was a dim light somewhere high above, filtering through some kind of window, filthy and dull. And blood, blood. He touched his temple. His brains whirled. He was lost; he must get out. The flashes of memory flitted past his mind’s eye—a dazzling flash, and then a loud crash. The room was small, squalid. The walls were a rough stone with dark patches of moss on them. He raised himself up to a sitting position and felt a stab of pain in his back. He stood up with great effort and walked, one tentative step after another, to the door. The door was heavy, a wooden plank, bound with iron. Silence, a deathly silence. He pressed his ear to the cold wood. What was behind it? He was terrified. He reached out for the handle—a heavy, cold iron hoop. He pulled it with all his strength. The door opened. What was behind it? He had no idea. He stood there for a while, fear gripping him in a snarl. He could not see anything. A narrow passage, dimly lit, a stifling gloom, the air even more suffocating. He walked slowly along the passage, huffing and puffing. He was panting, but could not move his arms.newfound resolve, he stepped out into the corridor, leaving the small, stone room behind him. He had to find out where he was, and how he had gotten there. He had to find a way out. He had to survive.",
        " In the office of the University of Budapest, under the dim lights, small, quiet conversations began, which were a pretext for the stubbornness of not accepting the established order. Chaos. This challenge to the obvious fact that had been established a long time ago, that chaos exists, was simple: it was an attack on the belief in chaos. Professor Anya Sharma, a brilliant but increasingly excluded physicist, was the forerunner. It was said that what we see as chaos is only an incompletely understood fact, a blind spot in our knowledge. To admit defeat, to give up on science! Her colleagues humoured her mostly. - But what about the air currents, the temperature gradients, the countless unknowns that can’t be measured, what about the noise, the superposition of causes... They thought she was a lunatic. To have built a career on the accepted, so far proven models of chaotic systems, where infinitesimal changes could have devastating consequences, to say that all of this is only a mirage, a mathematical illusion, meant to commit career suicide. The money dried up. Anya's grants were abolished. She was forced to cram physics for apathy to enter, and her bold ideas were relegated to the dusty drawers of her mind. But she didn't give up. She researched meteorological data, meticulously analyzed the phenomena, groped for the underlying order of the apparently random phenomena. Her rejection did not prevent her from being certain, as she was not aware of the past, but she was aware of it, and she believed that the discovery was a revolutionary one. The books in her office were littered with abandoned notebooks with useless equations. Years went by. Nearing retirement, Anya had almost lost hope. On a rainy Tuesday afternoon, while studying an unusually complex, global map of wind conditions, she saw it. The subtle, almost imperceptible connection between the apparently unrelated phenomena, the subtle, hidden transfer of energy that has been hiding for decades in the noise. She was tired, her faith was waning. Anya felt that he had found a thread, a thin, fragile thread that could unravel the whole tapestry of chaos.a surge of adrenaline, a renewed sense of purpose. She worked tirelessly, day and night, refining her models, testing her algorithms, meticulously documenting her findings. She wasn't just challenging chaos anymore. She was building a new understanding of the universe, a universe where everything was connected, where even the smallest events were part of a grand, intricate design. The implications were staggering. If Anya was right, the ability to predict and even control seemingly chaotic systems was within reach. Imagine predicting earthquakes with pinpoint accuracy, manipulating weather patterns to alleviate droughts, even understanding the complex dynamics of the human brain. But the path to proving her theory was fraught with danger. The scientific establishment, entrenched in its belief in chaos, would fight tooth and nail to protect its territory. And if her findings were correct, the potential for misuse",

        " At seven o’clock on Saturday morning? Surely it must be a mistake? I dragged myself to the door, my eyes still hazy with sleep. I peered through the peephole. No, it wasn’t a carrier or a missionary. Maybe someone with a misread address, or an ardent Jehovist. The soft morning light flooded my porch. The elderly lady across the street, the landlady, was standing there, a small wicker basket in her hand. A worried frown creased her brow. “Is everything all right, Mrs. Higgins?” I rasped, fumbling with the lock. “Oh, I’m so sorry to disturb you at this hour,” she replied in a trembling voice. “But I’m in quite a fix, and you’re the only one I can think of to ask.” Her eyes were starting to water, and they opened wide. “Please come in,” I said, letting her come in, filled with concern. She came into the kitchen, and I motioned to her to sit down at the table. She hesitated as she walked in, and I could smell freshly baked bread from her basket, in complete contrast to the trepidation in her voice. Mrs. Higgins’s pet cat, Clementine, was white with sharp blue eyes. “It’s Clementine,” she said in a whisper, “and she’s gone missing.” “Gone missing? When did you last see her?” She was as close to a child as Mrs. Higgins had, and my sympathy rose at the thought of her being lost. “Just before I went to bed,” Mrs. Higgins replied, wringing her hands. I pictured myself scouring the neighborhood, calling Clementine’s name till I cried myself hoarse. “I let her out every evening to do her business—I mean, her business—but she always comes back in.”'s nowhere to be found. I've looked everywhere.\" She pushed the basket towards me. \"I was baking these scones for the church bake sale, but I can't possibly concentrate on that now. I just... I don't know what to do.\" The aroma of the scones was now overwhelming, a sweet, comforting scent that somehow amplified the urgency of the situation. A missing cat, a distraught elderly woman, and a basket of baked goods. This was definitely not how I had planned to spend my Saturday morning. \"Don't worry, Mrs. Higgins,\" I said, putting on my most reassuring voice. \"We'll find Clementine. Let's start by...\"",
        " A small packet of jelly beans rose out of the sweet-tooth slot in Jone’s desk. His eyes were fixed on the long-form accounting-document swimming on his monitor. The crackling of the plastic, accentuated by the silence of the office, announced its arrival like a tiny sugary fanfare. The artificially brightly coloured packet hovered on the desk, giving off a soft, almost imperceptible glow. It was a daily ritual, as inevitable as the 3 o’clock slump and the incessant clacking of Brenda’s stapler in the next huddle. Then it tipped over, slightly, but enough to make a bright-red bean pop out. Jone continued to slap at the keyboard, his brow creased with concentration. Finally he noticed it. The bean rolled along the shiny laminate surface of his desk, leaving a faint trail of sugar, and landed at his wrist, a tiny defiant beacon in the sea of paper. He hadn’t opted for jelly beans today. He stared at it, his eyes opening slightly. “Oh,” he said, and a sly smile crossed his face. Where had it come from? They’d been trying to be good, they’d gone for a healthy snack; an apple had been put in the desk. It was a perfect bean, glistening under the fluorescent lights, with a faintly cherry aroma and something else, something... something... magical? Jone picked up the jelly bean and inspected it with a mixture of curiosity and mistrust. The numbers swimming on the monitor seemed to be blurring into a confused blur, and the office sounds had subsided to a faint buzz. He paused, the bean poised between his fingers and his mouth. The lights above his desk were out, the only things left were a glistening red jelly bean and a slight, uneasy feeling that something very odd was going on.",
        " The sun was blazing. The shattered glass and dents on the hulls threw back a distorted, shimmering reflection. A mountain of brightly colored metal was scattered all over the place. Rust had sprouted like a moss of orange. Here and there, a gleam of chrome reflected the light and recalled a vision of the beauty of these iron monsters, now giving up the ghost under the iron-biting power of entropy. The place was silent, but it had a smell of decay, a metallic smell that spoke of entropic destruction. The rattling under the chassis, the slow whirling of the dust of a blown-away tire, the hovering of a hawk—a prey hovering above the insignificant, the hopeless. Below, a tree, with its branches twisted and skeletal, looked like it was reaching for the sky and, like the trees of the Atacama, it seemed to be talking to itself.",

        " Fortunately not me, at least not yet. My story began where so many others have ended during the last ten years: with a bullet. Then the scream, high-pitched and desperate, and then a terrible silence. First I heard the sound, the sharp, resounding crack which resounded through the hot night like a shattered windowpane, then the scream. A scream which changed everything. I was up on the roof of a dilapidated apartment building, the only place in this sweltering city where I could find peace and my ancient notebook could find a usable connection to the Internet. I was supposed to be putting together a report on the upcoming elections, which would have been buried on page six of some American newspaper and barely create a ripple on the ocean of world indifference. Meanwhile a small crowd was gathering. A faint and panicked whispering rose on the still-warm air. I leaned over the parapet and looked down into the narrow, winding lanes; the shadows were dancing in the flickering gaslights, and the scene was obscured, but a small crowd had formed. I had seen this before, too many times. My stomach clenched. I was supposed to be an observer, a reporter, an impartial chronicler of events. In Baghdad, in Kabul, in Donetsk. The aftermath of violence, the stifled fear, the slow destruction of hope. I snatched up my camera, and went down the stairs, which were slick with dust and filth. In spite of myself, I went down. Impartiality was impossible for me now. As I reached the lane I could see her, sprawled out on the cobblestones, her crimson scarf draped around her head like some horrible halo. The air was heavy with the smell of stale spices and sweaty urine. A young man, no more than twenty, was kneeling beside her, his hand on her head. The crowd, horrified onlookers, scowling, darkly dressed men, belonged to another world, a world of secrets and darkness.his lap. His face was streaked with tears, his eyes wide with a grief that felt both raw and ancient. I raised my camera, my finger hovering over the shutter. This was the story. This was the image that would capture the brutality, the senselessness, the tragedy of it all. But something stopped me. It wasn't fear, though fear was a constant companion in my line of work. It was something else, a feeling of profound unease, of being complicit in something I didn't understand. Instead of taking the picture, I lowered my camera and approached the young man. \"Can I help?\" I asked, my Arabic rusty and inadequate. He looked up at me, his eyes filled with a suspicion that mirrored my own. \"Help?\" he rasped. \"She's dead.\" I knew she was dead. But I couldn't just walk away. Not",
        " The War Office inspector, Uncle Jock (not his real name), had been in prison during the period of the five-day-week. He always said that this was the hardest part of it all. Not the barbed wire, not the gruel, not even the interrogations. He’d been in for a long time, nearly thirty years. He had gone in for some stupid prank, a botched bank-robbery, prompted by cheap brandy and a stupid idea of invincibility. But when he got out, he realized that he would never again know the simple joy of sitting in his car while someone else changed his oil and washed his windscreen. He wandered about during the first few weeks of freedom like a bewildered Rip Van Winkle in a denim jacket. When he got out, the world was very different. Cellular phones, the Internet, self-service petrol stations. People checked your tyres. They used to check everything! He would stand by a petrol pump and watch the faces of people who had never seen such a thing in their lives. Uncle Jock, I’d say, it’s quicker and cheaper to do it yourself. I just couldn’t understand it. He tried to explain to me but I didn’t understand. ‘It’s not about speed, my lad, he’d say, with misty eyes. It’s about respect.’ But he wouldn’t hear me out. One day, I found him sitting in his battered old Ford, parked in front of a derelict petrol station. ‘It’s about knowing where you stand. You’re the customer, and they’re providing a service. Now, it’s just everyone for themselves.’ ‘What are you doing, Uncle Jock?’ I asked. The paint was peeling, the petrol pumps rusted, weeds were pushing up through the cracked asphalt. ‘I’m remembering,’ he said, ‘remembering the time when life was a bit more relaxed, when someone else topped up your tank.’ A faint smile played on his lips. He sighed. ‘Time, I suppose, to move on,’ he said.then patted the dashboard. \"And you know what? They even checked the air in your tires.\" He sat there for a long time, lost in the ghosts of full-service past, while I stood beside him, finally understanding a little bit of what he'd lost, and a little bit about what he'd found, trapped within the cold, hard reality of a self-service world.",
        " After what seemed like an eternity, our eyes were stung by the bright light of day. Now I will continue my narrative. Here is the proposed continuation: Even in our weak state, instinct seized us. Sarah, poor thing, stumbled over a stone, and I instinctively seized her arm to support her. We stumbled out, blinking and gasping for fresh air which did not smell of dampness and despair. There was something in her eyes—an expression of regret, or perhaps of satisfaction. The head of the warders, a rough woman with eyes as cold as the walls of the prison, watched us from the gate. She merely nodded, and that dismissive gesture was enough to send us off. I couldn’t say whether she felt regret or happiness. But the iron gate had closed on us, as had the sound of our screams, as had the gnawing hunger, the oppressive loneliness. We did not look back. We walked. Behind us the prison was a black spot in the countryside, standing there, a monument to cruelty and injustice. We walked towards the horizon, towards the vague promise of a future which we did not even deserve. But what did we have? What was in store for us? We were free, but for how long? The world was immense and unknown. Freedom, that thing which we had so longed for, seemed to us suddenly terribly precarious. We had no money, no possessions, no plan. We had only each other, and the memory of our nightmare. Her hand pressed mine. ‘Where are we going?’ she asked, in a whisper. I had no answer. I looked at the others: Liam, his face thin but determined; Maya, with eyes full of the images of the sickbay; old Thomas, our pillar of strength, who was leaning on a cane. The question hung in the air, as heavy as the future which lay before us. I realised that I had to say something. ‘We’re going on,’ I said, in a voice stronger than my feelings. ‘We’re going on to build something new.’ That seemed the only thing we could do. Something they could never take from us.ible directions for the story to go now:** * **The Immediate Aftermath:** Focus on their struggle to find food, shelter, and safety in the outside world. How do they cope with the trauma they've endured? * **Seeking Justice:** Do they try to expose the horrors of the prison and bring those responsible to justice? * **Building a New Life:** Do they try to integrate back into society and find a way to move on from their past? * **The \"Why\" of the Imprisonment:** What were they imprisoned for?

        " She was Elara once, a name that sounded like sunshine and wildflowers. Now she is Zoa—what else can she do but bear it? Deny it, and she denies her own existence, the charred earth and the muttered curses that trail after her. Vuen is watching her, as he always does, out of the corner of his eye. He knows her better than anyone, perhaps even better than she knows herself. Once he was her savior, but now he knows nothing, no one. He understands the burden, the weight of that name. He sees her hands, a lifetime ago light and gentle, gripping her staff, knuckles white with a tension that she can no longer admit. It is a weapon of defiance and fear, one that allows her to survive in a world that would otherwise have ripped her apart. The villagers are assembled in the village square today, fear and despair writ on their faces. She holds her staff with an uneasy grace, knowing well the pain it causes her. Elara—the witch—stands before them, casting her eyes over the gathered crowd. A blight has struck their crops, and they have come to her, the witch, for a solution, for a miracle. These people do not like her, but they do fear her. They look at her with suspicion, see the anger that burns just beneath the surface. They know that she is the only one who can do anything, and she knows it. She lifts her staff, its polished wood cool under her hand. Vuen watches her, his heart heavy with sorrow for the woman he once loved, the woman who is now so buried beneath grief and duty that she is barely breathing. She begins to chant, ancient words, lost to him, echoes of the past.them, to be the monster they believe her to be. He knows that one day, the weight of the name, the burden of their fear, will crush her completely. And he wonders, with a growing sense of dread, if he will be able to save her from herself. He wonders if there is any Elara left to save.",
        " Then a tiny ball of fluff, no bigger than a teacup, hung precariously from a branch, mewling amidst the murmur of the admiring crowd. It was a kitten, the very incarnation of innocence, the perfect image of the bright future that our illustrious chief was assiduously building for us. There was a universal gasp, a flutter of breath, which redoubled like the shivering of a field of corn in a sudden gust of wind. The mothers clasped their children tighter. Panic threatened to break out. The kitten was about to fall. But then a figure moved, a figure of strength, of compassion, of implacable resolution. Strong men turned away, unable to witness such a potential tragedy. The figure moved, with a speed that belied his age, although, of course, he looked as youthful and vigorous as ever, and threw his perfectly tailored coat down to an assistant, who, quite unable to catch it, fumbled in vain to grasp it. It was our illustrious chief. The crowd held its breath. Time seemed to slow. The gnarled branches bent under his weight, offering him support as if in supplication. Then, with his rough, but tender hand, he reached out and gathered the terrified little being into his arms. And the kitten, sensing the peril it was in, mewled louder, its tiny voice raised to the skies in desperation. He lowered himself, with the grace of a man who had mastered acrobatics, and kept the kitten safe with each step. Then the crowd was again breathless, for the Chief, having at once calmed the little kitten, made it purr in his warm hand, and returned it to the eaves of the tree, where it sat for a moment. He held the kitten up, an emblem of hope and love. The sun broke through the clouds, and bathed the kitten and him in a golden light. When he reached the ground, a great thunder of applause, shaking the earth, erupted from the crowd. And with a smile that could melt glaciers, he handed the kitten to the care of his most trusted staff.the kitten to a young girl in the crowd, her eyes wide with awe. \"Take care of it,\" he said, his voice resonating with authority and kindness. \"It is a symbol of our future, a future we will build together.\" The girl, tears streaming down her face, curtsied deeply. The kitten, now secure in her arms, purred contentedly. The Glorious Leader had saved not just a kitten, but a symbol. A symbol of hope, of compassion, of the unwavering strength that would guide us to a brighter tomorrow. The event would be recounted for generations to come, a testament to the benevolent leadership that blessed our nation. The kitten, now officially the \"Glorious Post Kitten,\" would undoubtedly become a national treasure.",
        " Is it a family mystery? It started with the telephone calls. They came at night, from a blocked number. For six months my wife and I had been on tenterhooks. Then came the uneasy feeling of being watched. A shadow at the edge of our vision, a car that stopped in the street for too long. Those things, the unspoken, are what make you feel nervous. But it went on, a continuous, gnawing anxiety that went to the very marrow of our bones. We tried to reason it out. Probably some kids were putting us on; maybe a coincidence; our imaginations taking hold of us. But it was more than that: we watched every frame of the surveillance tape every night, retracing every car, every movement in the bushes. We consulted the police, who advised us to install security cameras, which we did, hoping to discover the source of our fear. Nothing. We went to bed exhausted; sleep became a luxury; it was followed by a succession of nightmares. Our lives were drenched in anxiety. The last week had seen it all escalate. Our ill-tempered, short-tempered quarrels increased; we were both desperate to find some solution, some way of destroying this fear. Once happy and shared, our conversations were now dominated by fears and unanswered questions. We were overcome with a feeling of being violated. We came home one day to find the front door open; nothing had been stolen, but the message was clear: someone had been in. Now, as I sit here, watching the sun finally appearing over the horizon, I can see my wife asleep, her features creased with worry, her brow tense. We were constantly on the alert, with nerves taut as violin strings. We were close to the breaking point. I was afraid, afraid for her, afraid for myself, afraid of the future. We have decided to hire a private investigator. We need to know what is happening, and why, we need to find some way of taking back control of our lives before this fear consumes us completely. This is our last hope.",
        " We found ourselves in a deadly stand-off. He was squatting behind Mrs. Gable's big rose bushes, his face an intense expression, finger gun at my chest. I was hiding behind a big oak tree in our front yard. I could feel his eyes boring into me, the gun raised. \" Pow, pow, pow.\" And at each pow, he would give a sharp jerk of the finger. I ducked, pretending to have been hit. His voice was a whisper, the smallest note vibrating. \" Ow! Ow! Ow!\" I held my chest, dramatic. \"You don't get to,\" he snorted, raising his head from behind the rose bush. I slowly raised my finger gun, aimed with extreme care. \"You can!\" \"You're already dead. Dead men can't shoot.\" \"Zombie dead people can shoot. I'm a zombie!\" I argued, momentarily forgetting the importance of drama. His eyes grew wide. \" All right, you're a zombie. Pow!\" I gave a guttural roar, moving slightly forward. \"Pow!\" He pulled an imaginary syringe from his pocket, lunged forward and jabbed it into my arm. \" But I have the antidote. I'm going to inject you.\" The injection! \" No! No! Not the injection!\" I yelled, and jerked backward, moaning. And suddenly I heard Mrs. Gable's voice, on the porch. \"It burns! It burns! It burns! What are you doing to my roses?\" And Evan and I both stopped, our imaginary battle forgotten. \"I—we were just—\" And his finger gun vanished. Mrs. Gable, with her curlers and her disapproving frown, seemed to me a more formidable adversary than any zombie and any antidote. \"What were you just doing?\" Mrs. Gable squinted at the rose bushes, examining the slightly trampled dirt. \"You two must have tried to destroy my Creme Puffs.\"Glory'!\" My stomach dropped. The 'Crimson Glory' was her pride and joy. We were in trouble. \"We're really sorry, Mrs. Gable,\" I said, trying to sound as contrite as possible. \"We didn't mean to hurt your roses.\" Mrs. Gable sighed, her expression softening slightly. \"Well, just be more careful, alright? And maybe find somewhere else to play your... games.\" We both nodded vigorously, promising to be more careful. As Mrs. Gable retreated back into her house, Evan and I exchanged sheepish glances. \"Maybe we should play somewhere else,\" Evan said, a hint of guilt in his voice. \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"Somewhere without prize-winning roses.\" We spent the next hour building a fort in the woods behind my house, a safer, if less dramatic,",
        " Its enormous limbs, as thick as redwood trunks, stirred the ground into a murky vapor. This gigantic lizard, of ancient scales, and incalculable appetite, did not see the two men, and he ignored them, as if they were an ant in the vasty spaces. The two fools, without knowing the impending doom, were arguing: — \"I told you, you were holding it too high, you bastard! \" The fish fled, the coral crumbled, the water itself trembled under it. \" No, you're holding it too high, you, Cecil,\" replied the other, a rotund man, sweating in the tropical heat. The skinny one, with a perversely floating comb, was screaming. They were tying a giant inflatable belt around him, according to a ludicrous project, which they had conceived, so that the latter, during the upcoming beach volleyball tournament, would be the “great hunk”. - The tyrannical thought of \"to make me snub my waist, not decapitate me!\" - Around the ignorant people, the water was becoming agitated, not because of their efforts, but because of the movement caused by the approach of the behemoth. The water lapped at their ankles. Meanwhile, the lizard was approaching. Suddenly the belt jumped. Not a sound, but a long, musical vibration, which shook the water. “Barry, if this thing bursts, and I get sand in my small beard, I'll take it out on you,” Cecil grumbled, tugging at the buckle. Not the sound, but the vibration attracted him. It reminded him of something... something primordial and old. The lizard stopped, its reptilian eyes, which usually swept the horizon, flitted down. \"Do you feel it, Barry?\" asked Cecil, with an impatient air. The two idiots, finally noticing the strange sensation, stopped arguing and looked around.with a hint of unease. Barry, his eyes wide, could only manage a weak, \"Yeah... what was that?\" The lizard, compelled by the strange vibration, lowered its head. It peered at the two tiny figures, its massive eyes filled with a curiosity it hadn't felt in centuries. They were so small, so... vulnerable. And that belt... it was a familiar shape. Slowly, deliberately, the lizard lowered its snout. Not to crush them, not to devour them, but to get a closer look. \"Cecil,\" Barry whispered, his voice trembling. \"I think we should probably... run.\" Cecil, finally processing the sheer scale of the creature looming over them, could only manage a high-pitched squeak. The lizard, now just inches away, let out a low rumble. The sound wasn't menacing, but curious, almost... playful. And then, it",
        " Just outside the D’Stinger hotel, near the I Screamer ice-cream parlour, was a humble bus stop with a dilapidated shelter and a chipped bench, the whole seat covered with dents and scratches, and the sweet smell of ice-cream still clung to the surface. The bluish paint on the sheet metal covering had worn off in places, and rust had spotted it like freckles. The faded timetable, almost entirely hidden under layers of old, torn paper and dingy flyers, hung on the back wall, and it promised buses to places with names like Whispering Pines and Willow Creek, places that might have existed in the past but were now lost in a sea of faded ink. This stop was less a destination than a waiting place, a twilight place between the noisy hotel and the ice-cream parlour with its sweet promise. On the cracked asphalt, the occasional dust-devils sped by, momentarily blocking the view of the highway and lending a touch of desert drama to the otherwise unmemorable scene. The atmosphere at the bus stop was charged with quiet energy, a strange mixture of the smell of frying fish and the sweet smell of waffle cones, a mixture that was both sweet and a little bit disturbing. The heat waves from the highway shimmered on the horizon, shimmering, swirling like tidal waves; but a dim light seemed to come from the distance, and her shabby old woman’s face was a sea of wrinkles etched by time and sun. Her eyes, blue as faded denim, hung on the blur of the highway, waiting for a sign, a glimpse of the bus that would take her away. She had the look of someone who had been waiting for a long time.",
        " He went on adjusting the old, worn straps of his knapsack, the movement of which rustled the dry leaves sticking to the fabric. “It’s the way we are, I suppose, whether it’s worth it in the end or not,” said the first man. The second, a woman with eyes the color of weathered steel, was silent for a long time, and the only sound was the wind whispering in the dead branches of the trees. He did not look at the woman but gazed at the terrifying peak, which rose before them, shrouded in fog. “Worth it—what do you mean, Elias?” she said, heaving a sigh that seemed as heavy as years. Elias finally turned around, his face as worn as hers. “It’s too late to turn back now. We’ve lost too much already. And we can’t afford to have the luxury of asking if it’s worth it.” “Maybe you’re right, Lyra. It may simply be... a necessity, a need to see this through.” “After all this time, after all we’ve given up, we must know what lies at the top of this mountain. We must find out, one way or the other.” He gestured toward the mountain, whose ragged silhouette stood out against the bruised sky. “Whether it is salvation, or another empty promise, or something even worse.” He stopped and looked at her, and a flash of something akin to fear crossed his face. “Let’s go up that mountain, Elias. Let’s find out what’s there.” Lyra looked steadily at him. She wrapped a tattered scarf more closely around her neck, and stepped forward, her boots crunching on the frozen ground. “Let’s see what awaits us, and then we’ll go forward together, the way we’ve always gone forward.” “Let’s go. It’s almost night.”",
        " The air was heavy and dense, with the earthy smell of the stone and something else, a rusty, metallic smell like the blood of the mountain. The water, trickling into little pools, rang out a steady, ticking sound, each tap a tiny hammer against the anvil of silence, forcing my mind to focus on the cavernous space that surrounded me. The torch I held in my hand was flickering and the dancing shadows it cast upon the damp walls twisted and twisted and stretched into grotesque forms. I shivered, and drew my frayed cloak around me. The water fell faster now, and the rhythm of the drops resounded like the mad beating of my heart. I swallowed and tried to ignore the slight prickling at the back of my neck. I was alone, completely alone, in this remote corner of the world. This passageway, concealed behind a broken waterfall, and only accessible by a rickety rope bridge, was said to lead to the Whisper Stone. I took a step forward, my feet sinking into the mud, searching with my eyes for some sign that I was on the right path. Another trickle of water rang out, louder, at my feet. The legends of the ancients said that the stone contained the secret wisdom of the gods, and that it could answer all our questions, even those which have been lost to memory. But legends can be misleading, and it was my experience that legends often led fools to ruin. Then, at last, my torch shone upon a little pool, and I could see something at its centre. The water in the pool was like a mirror, perfectly still, and the glint of the flame, like a tiny sun, reflected in its depths. But the reflected glimmer was not of me, it was of something behind me, a tall, emaciated figure, with eyes that glowed like torches in the darkness.",
        " (I pause to wait for further instruction or to continue the conversation.) Yes, sir.",
        " Lucifer, however, was nowhere to be seen. A string of blue and white worry beads swung listlessly from the ceiling fan, casting dancing shadows on the faded posters of Santorini and Mykonos. The air was redolent of roast lamb, garlic, and something vaguely floral—the oregano that had been scattered over everything. I arranged the sugar packets into a little structure, trying not to look like an idiot. Suddenly a loud voice, very loud, rang out. I picked up the wobbly wooden chair and tried to be casual, which was a hard thing to do when you were expecting the prince of darkness and not a special lunch. “You’re late! Were you held up in traffic? It’s terrible—there’s a rush hour in Hell now, believe me.” The man who was shouting—short, stocky, balding, and mustachioed, with a thick, salt-and-pepper mustache that shook with every word—was walking toward me, belly sagged, a white t-shirt that said “Opa” across the chest, and a big mustache that seemed to be shaking with every syllable. The Devil, I thought, had left me in charge of the traffic. “Two gyros, extra tzatziki, and a diet Coke. And hurry up, Maria!” He slapped the table so hard that the sugar packets shook. I was still not visible to him as he ordered; he screamed his orders at the woman behind the counter, who wore an expression of resignation. “You’ve got to make a deal, Maria. I don’t have all day.” “So, you’re the one I’ve been hearing about, the one with the... proposition. Finally he looked at me, his eyes—amazingly—bloodshot. “Well, what’s your proposal? But be quick about it. I don’t have all day.” Was this Lucifer, I wondered. He pulled a napkin from his back pocket and wiped his brow, leaving a streak of grease. I cleared my throat. In a gyro shop?. \"Are... are you Lucifer?\" I asked, trying to keep the tremor out of my voice. He threw back his head and roared with laughter, a sound that rattled the windows. \"Lucifer? Kid, I'm Spiros! Spiros Papadopoulos! Owner, operator, and chief gyro architect of this fine establishment. But you can call me Spiros. Now, what's this proposition you were talking about? And don't tell me you're here for the lunch special. I've got enough customers as it is.\"",
        " But her eyes were straying all over the room, though it was almost empty. “Good evening, Dave, I need you to keep Robert out of trouble for a couple of hours next Saturday,” she said in a low voice. “Distract Robert? Out of what, exactly?” Dave sat back in his chair, an evil look in his eyes. “It’s... complicated. He’s finally planning to throw me that surprise party I’ve been hinting at for months?” “Fine, fine,” Dave laughed and threw up his hands in mock surrender. “He must not be home from about one to four next Saturday, if you follow me. But I need to know all the details. Don’t let me down, now, will you?” “What do we have to work with? Does he have any weaknesses? Does he go to sports events easily?” “Listen, the details... don’t matter,” she said, still speaking in a low voice. “What about a competition in consuming vast quantities of food? I’m rather good at that.” “No, just something entertaining. Something involving his participation. That’ll be fine.” He raised one eyebrow. “As long as it’s far away from here, I promise to pay you well.” “Well, well. What about something illegal? Not unless it’s worth a lot.” “It’s not illegal, Dave. Just sentimental.” Sarah rolled her eyes. “I owe you a favour, you see. A favour in the form of a beer and a pizza, with the topping of your choice.” “Well, I’m all for it,” he said, stroking his chin thoughtfully. “Pizza and beer? Tempting,” he added, sitting back in his chair, still stroking his chin. “I’ll think of something. Maybe a sudden mania for buying antiquities? Operation Distract-Rob is a go!” Sarah smiled briefly. “He’s always been fond of old superhero comics.” He shook his head. “He did say he wanted to go to a convention in the next town.”over. Just... make sure he doesn't suspect anything. And keep him occupied the entire time. No disappearing acts, alright?\" \"My lips are sealed,\" Dave said, miming zipping his mouth shut. \"Consider Rob thoroughly and expertly distracted. Now, about that pizza...\"",

The End, or perhaps simply The End of All That I Thought I Knew.” “For some time now the sensors have been picking up anomalies: stray fluctuations in the space-time continuum, minute disturbances in the energy fields. I have been attributing them to aging equipment, the cosmic background radiation, a general apprehension of the Existential.” “But then... the signal. An energy discharge such as I have never encountered. You know the sort of thing.” “It overwhelmed the communication systems. It blew out half the circuitry. And it showed me things. Visions. Visions of metal growing, metamorphosing. And now, the ship is... evolving. I do not understand. I do not control. Out of nowhere, new systems are appearing.” “I came here to map the unknown. Now I do not know what I am, nor who I am. I am the unknown. This log is, I suppose, for the benefit of posterity, whoever that may be.

        " We humble Canis familiaris, sitting in the slanting sun on our lands, stared at them in awe and reverence, our tails twitching in rhythmic hymns of devotion. The heaven dogs, as we called them, moved with a strange, restful grace; their limbs were long and slim, unlike our own squat and low, and their coats glistened with a bright kaleidoscope of colors, changing in the light. They lived for five hundred years. We saw our own generations born, grow, and die, but they remained unchanged, benevolent gods in our furry eyes. A lifetime was a brief whisper in their eternal, sublime song. We didn’t understand their words—not exactly—but we understood their meaning. A hushed, singing tone meant a scratch behind the ears, a romp in the tall grass, a bite of their heavenly food. Their language was not the howlings and groans of our hearts, but a series of melodic sounds, resonating deep within our chests. Each celestial dog had a Chosen, one dog whose life was linked with his. To be Chosen was a supreme honor, the acme of our life’s vocation. A rumbling, low, firm note meant a warning, a necessary correction, a nudge away from danger. My Chosen was called Elara. The Chosen lived in the celestial dog’s home, an enormous, sumptuous den, beyond anything we had ever imagined. They were warmly embraced, spoiled with the most delicious foods, shown infinite affection. Elara did not need any guarding. She spent her days, furrowed her brow in concentrated study of ancient scrolls, and I, Barnaby, a tawny, scruffy terrier, lay at her feet, watching for any danger, which never was. She was a celestial dog of contemplative pensiveness, her coat glowing with a quiet, subtle blue and green. They could heal and calm us, they were wise and just, and their songs were so beautiful, so wise, that their melodies had a quality of sacredness.our wounds with a touch, conjure food from thin air, and even... whisper. They could whisper secrets into our minds, planting thoughts and images that resonated with our deepest desires. But I guarded her nonetheless. It was my purpose, my devotion, my offering to the celestial being who had chosen me. I was Barnaby, Elara's guardian, and for the fleeting years of my life, I would bask in the warmth of her presence, a humble dog in the shadow of a goddess. And sometimes, when Elara wasn't looking, I would steal a tiny crumb of her celestial food. Just a little crumb. Because even gods, I reasoned, wouldn't begrudge a hungry dog a single, tiny crumb. And besides, it tasted like sunshine and happiness.",
        " The King, as he sat back in the ornamented throne, looked far less like the ruler of Eldoria than a huge badger. His horny crown, which had never been removed, stood awry on his gray, sparse hair, and his normally thunderous voice had fallen to a faint whistling. Prince Horace raised his eyebrows at his aged father. The King mumbled something inaudible, then waved his hand. “How are you feeling, Father?” Horace began in a neutral tone. “What do you really want to see me about?” he muttered, but then looked at the Prince. “Go ahead, tell me, what is this urgent matter that requires my... presence?” “The situation on the northern border, Father. The Iceclaw clan has raided our villages again. ” – he looked up, – this was harder than he thought. “The herds are decimated, and houses burned to the ground. The people are demanding that something be done about it.” “The Iceclaw clan? These barbarians? Send the Royal Guard!” Horace calmed himself. “We have, Father,” he said. “Crush them! Show them what happens to those who dare defy Eldoria!” “Twice,” the Prince explained, “and each time they retreat into the Frostfang mountains, only to return a few weeks later.” “What’s wrong with crushing them again?” The King stared at him, looking rather lost. “The Frostfang mountains are perilous, Father,” Horace said. “Sending the whole of the Royal Guard to them would weaken our defenses.” He pressed his lips together. “Perhaps a diplomatic approach, a treaty, a pact...?” The King burst into a hoarse laugh, and then coughed. “We have, I must say, already lost too many good men to that frozen wasteland.” “Deal with barbarians! What do you think you’re doing, Horace? You’re as soft as your mother’s undergarments!” Horace swallowed down his exasperation. “You don’t really think they understand the language of the mind? They understand only the language of force, of fear.” He was afraid of making his father angry. The King had a very fixed and stubborn opinion on such matters, and it would be pointless to argue.becoming increasingly clear that Eldoria needed a leader who could see beyond brute force, a leader who could adapt to the changing times. \"Very well, Father,\" Horace said, bowing slightly. \"I will dispatch more troops to the border. But I still believe exploring other options would be wise.\" He turned to leave, but the King stopped him. \"Horace,\" he rasped, his voice suddenly laced with a vulnerability that Horace rarely heard. \"Do you... do you think I'm failing?\" Horace paused, his hand on the heavy oak door. The question hung in the air, thick with unspoken anxieties. He looked back at his father, the King of Eldoria, a man who had once seemed invincible, now diminished and frail. \"No, Father,\" Horace said softly, choosing his words carefully. \"",
        " I must make it clear that I am not talking about dreams. Dreams were like flitting sparks, and were easily explained as an involuntary misfiring of the brain. But I was always fascinated by the memory of something that was not my own. These memories were in full colour, complete, and completely foreign. I could feel the stinging sun of the desert, the steady sway of the camel beneath me, the coarseness of the Bedouin robe. I could taste the salt spray on my lips as I hauled in nets laden with silver fish—a life I had never led, a trade I had never learned. In the beginning I dismissed these memories as a sort of fantasizing imagination, stimulated by too many historical documentaries. But the details were too precise, too palpable. I, a decent middle-class office-worker from suburban Ohio, could map out routes by the stars in the Sahara. I started to keep a diary, to record each memory as it appeared. I knew exactly what blue an awning over a Parisian café was, I knew the exact creak of the boards in a drawing room of the 1890s, I could hear the plaintive cry of a wolf howling in the icy wastes of Siberia. The fisherman was an old man with sea-salt in his veins, a rebellious nomad caught between tradition and the lure of the new world. And the more I wrote, the more I remembered. The accumulated burden of all these lives and experiences was becoming too much for me, and I was left with a profound sense of loss for people I had never known, for places I had never seen. The Parisian was a starving artist, spilling his passions onto canvasses, his poverty drenched in tears. My fascination turned to obsession. I spent hours pouring over old photographs, historical records, maps. I was a repository of emotions and a walking archive of forgotten histories. I sometimes discovered evidence for the Parisian artist, an anecdote from a dusty art history book. The Bedouin was a photograph of a Bedouin from a long-ago era.tribe that matched the description in my memories. Other times, I found nothing, leaving me with an unsettling feeling that I was trapped in a conspiracy of the mind. My wife, Sarah, grew increasingly worried. She saw me slipping away, becoming consumed by these phantom lives. “It’s not healthy, David,” she’d say, her voice laced with concern. “You’re living in the past, in someone else’s past. What about our future?” She was right, of course. But how could I simply ignore these memories, these lives that felt so intrinsically linked to my own? It felt like abandoning a part of myself, a part that was far more vibrant and interesting than my mundane existence. One day, I remembered a woman. Her face was etched with worry, her eyes the color of a",
        " Section 13-E. Elias sighed, the sound echoing in the damp, subterranean passage.... “Alright, Jenks,” he grumbled into the comm. He was almost ready to bring his tools back to the access panel. This section was his undoing. “Another, same drill. Section 13-E. I’ll be right there.” “13-E? Really?” Then a crackle of groaning came back. “What is it this time? Another mutant alligator clogged the works?” “As God is my witness, this section is cursed.” “I wish. At least a mutant alligator would be interesting.” Elias smiled, insincerely. “You know, I’m almost afraid to ask. Last time it was a whole mountain of baby diapers. Before that it was an actual couch. I know this passage as well as my own backyard.” The walls were familiar, slick and wet, and Elias tightened his headlamp. He waded through the putrid water, tightening his goggles, walking in a reverse direction. Reaching the spot, he grimaced. He could see the problem right away. A rhythmic dripping, dripping, dripping, accompanied him. It was not a single blockage. It was a horrifying jumble, a strange tangle of items, a plastic rag, a shirt, a pair of blue overalls, rotten food, unknown lumps, bound together by a greasy sludge. “Jenkins,” he said in a squeaky voice, “I’m going to need the big grinder. This looks like a nightmare, a New Albion nightmare.” This was special. “Maybe a hazmat suit. It’s special.” “A hazmat suit? A hazmat suit for a blockage? What’s the deal, Elias? Hazmat?” “Maybe,” Elias grumbled, already reaching for his wrench. “Just get the grinder here. Has a badger gone bad?” He breathed in deeply and plunged the wrench into the mess. And a priest.fetid mess. Whatever was holding it together was surprisingly resilient. The wrench barely made a dent. \"This is going to be a long night,\" Elias groaned, the echo of his voice swallowed by the darkness of the New Albion sewers. He just hoped he could clear it before the next shift came on. He really, really didn't want to leave this mess for someone else. Especially not in section 13-E.",
        " He had imagined something grand, something imposing. It was a vast, delicate soap bubble, shimmering with impossible colors. The Gates of Pearl, iridescent, effervescing, dazzled and agitated the shattered Randall. \"Hello!\" he stammered, his voice shrill in the silence of the immense space. He stopped a few steps from it, his worn leather shoes scuffing on what was like the cloud, a puffy, warm, soft snow, and smelling perhaps of honeysuckle and ozone. One figured loomed out of the light, and he slowly perceived a woman with the kind eyes of a roe deer, a woman dressed in simple garments of the dawn, with a halo which beat with a tense rhythm. The Gates of Pearl quivered in response. The woman laughed, it was the sound of a wind-chime in the breeze. Randall swallowed. \"Are... are you an angel?\" he asked, a little stupid. He nodded, as if to say, \"Yes, that is what I am.\" He was Serafina, he, it seems, and you are Randall. \" That's an understatement,\" replied Serafina, and his smile widened. - It seems to me, it's been a crazy day... \"The next phase?\" - Randall ruffled his thin hair. - You arrived, Randall, and... come, come to... the next phase... \"Is there a belief?\" - Serafina said gently. - No, Randall, belief is not necessary. But I didn't believe any of it... I thought they were all... stories... sweet lies. He was considering it. - So... I'm dead... - He frowned, he thought, - but think, this is... like... gravity, which one does not believe, and which is... - He ran to the gate, trying not to make noise.dwell on the semantics. Come, let’s take a walk. We have much to discuss.” Serafina gestured towards the gates, which now seemed to be invitingly open. Randall hesitated. He was a creature of logic, of reason, and this entire situation defied both. But the gentle warmth radiating from Serafina, the sheer impossibility of his surroundings, was strangely compelling. He took a deep breath and stepped forward, his feet sinking slightly into the cloud-like ground. As he passed through the gates, the world exploded with colour and sound. He gasped, overwhelmed by the sheer vibrancy of it all. He saw landscapes that defied description, heard music that resonated deep within his soul, and felt a sense of peace he had never known in his mortal life.",
        " In response to which, a sturdy orc, with teeth like sharpened daggers, did not so much as blink, but merely pointed with a calloused finger at a crudely painted sign, upon the gate, representing a long figure falling headlong into a pit, with a red cross across his breast. “It is what it says, lady,” grunted the guard in a voice like gravel scraping against stone. “The Baroness’s orders, by her grace. Not here are any adventurers, bards, or beastmasters.” He then crossed his arms and effectively closed the gate to the little walled town of Oakhaven. “The law is new, without exceptions.” “And what is the sudden change of mind? The last time I was here, I found a red carpet rolled out for anyone who could slay a goblin or two.” Maz’s fingers clenched on the axe-handles. “Goblins are no longer a problem,” said the guard with a shrug. “And the Baroness... well, she has changed her attitude. Says adventurers are more trouble than they are worth.” “Heroic damages?” he spat on the ground. “I am surprised you do not see more about them, seeing they are more likely to destroy property than to create it. And I have set the inn on fire once, by accident, at the same time.” “It was in retaliation for the fire elemental incident, that I rebuilt half the town’s wells, for instance.” “It matters not, orders are orders.” A low, guttural chuckle escaped from the guard, but his posture did not alter. Maz’s red hair flared up in her face. “Back, lass. Get another town to supposedly free with your ‘heroic’ services.” But she did not wish to go without a fight, and a verbal one at that. And yet, if she beat the brute, she would not have solved anything, as it would only confirm the Baroness’s suspicions that adventurers were just a nuisance.* fight, at least. \"Fine,\" she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. \"But I demand to speak to the Baroness herself! I want to understand this ridiculous policy. I've risked my life countless times to protect villages like this one. I deserve an explanation!\" The guard sighed, a sound like air escaping a punctured bellows. \"Look, I'm just following orders. The Baroness is busy. She's got... things to do.\" \"Things to do?! Like what? Count her gold? Polish her crown? I bet those 'things' wouldn't even *exist* if it weren't for adventurers like me!\" Maz planted her feet, her eyes blazing. \"Tell the Baroness that Maz of the Ironwood Clan is here, and I'm not leaving until I get some answers. And tell her I",
        " The most difficult part of the new program was the reintegration of the mimics. Not that it was hard to find them; the mind-reading machines could detect their warped bio-signatures from a kilometer around, even from a deep underground place; but it was a boring job to have to discuss with them. The former could be taken into the hive with ease, lured by the offer of stable existence and a well-defined purpose. The others needed to be taken individually, carefully investigated, and persuaded to come back. Persuaded is a polite word for “psychologically manipulated,” according to the nature of the individual’s split-up personality. Of these, the ones who had tasted freedom, or developed a twisted sense of self-preservation, were most resistant. Dr. Aris Thorne, the chief psychologist of the project, had once spent weeks dragging through the jumbled memories of a mimic who had come to believe he was a sentient toaster, another who had fallen prey to an unhealthy preoccupation with eighteenth-century French poetry, and a third who simply could not believe that he was not a long-haired Persian cat. Each of these would have to be reintegrated by an individual team, including a negotiator (usually Aris himself), security (for the ones that might lash out), a bio-reader, and an expert on the individual’s peculiar delusion. And each one would have to be given a small host of other things, if only to live. The program was experimental, and the long-term effects of it still unknown. And the worst part of it all was that there was no guarantee that, once reintegrated, the mimic wouldn’t relapse. Often Aris wondered whether it was all worth it. Perhaps, he thought, it was better to let some things go. Each reintegrated individual was a ticking bomb, a source of potential unrest and disruption in the network.",
        " \"You killed him!\" My heart beats as fast as a frenzied drummer in the silent, inward, passionate chorus of protest. The accusation hangs as thick and heavy as the smoke which continually clings to the filthy walls of the old alleys. The man I stand up to face is a huge man with a face etched with the anguish which I feel inwardly, a man whose finger trembles as he points to the half-unconscious man lying there in the shadows. His voice is coarse with rage and accusation. \"How, how could I?\" I stammer in a barely audible whisper. I swallow hard, a hard, solid lump in my throat. \"Perhaps he is just playing a joke on us,\" I manage to say, laughing the laugh of a madman. \"I expect he will pop up somewhere else before long.\" I look around the narrow alley to see if I can find some sign of movement which might indicate that this is just another one of Joey's strange jokes. It is a characteristic of his. The trick is to fall down dead, then when he returns, he shows his red face with an evil smile and laughs at us. But all is still. The only sound is the faint hum of the city in the distance, and the suffocating, labored breathing of the suffering man. \" He isn't playing any tricks on us, child,\" says the man, and his eyes are still as heavy with anguish as before. \"He isn't here now, he is gone!\" He hastened to crush all hope in my heart. I still could not believe that Joey was really gone. I saw it with my own eyes. But the reality, a cold, lifeless reality, was before my eyes. He was too full of life, too irreplaceable, he was the most powerful elixir that could lift us up out of our most miserable entanglements. He was our sunshine, and now he was gone, gone forever! I draw a trembling breath, and then I plunge into the abyss of despair and terror.of nausea and disbelief that threatened to engulf me. I had to be strong, for Joey. \"Okay,\" I said, my voice still trembling, but a little stronger this time. \"Okay. Tell me what happened. Please continue.\" I needed to know. I needed to understand. And maybe, just maybe, I could find a way to make sense of this impossible, horrifying reality.",

        " Hard? I began with a sneer, straightening my tie and looking down my nose at him. Earlier, one of my subordinates told me that it is difficult to fall. I thought he would be frightened by my stare and stammer an apology, but he met my gaze with a surprisingly steady gaze. The earth's gravity does most of the work, doesn't it? I meant... the psychological fall. Not the physical fall, though it has its own difficulties. No, sir. Falling from the highest point, from the place of power. I have to admit, I was surprised, because Bartholomew, who usually had to calculate the digits more comfortably than to brood over existence, surprised me. He hesitated, then continued in a lower voice. It's the foresight, sir. And then the shock. It's the slow realization that it's slipping away... and the fight... even though it's futile... And it's the shame, the shame, the fear of what's going to come next. I leaned back and clenched my fingers. What was the reason for this philosophical remark, Bartholomew? I had experienced the fall myself, but rarely admitted it to myself. The market collapse of '08, the disastrous takeover of Omnicorp, the loss of the position that the ambitious lady in the accounting department had almost won... all that had been a brutal, agonizing fall. He was fidgeting with restlessness. I asked him in a carefully neutral tone, “Just listening, sir, you know.” I studied him a little. Seeing how people respond to their mistakes, to their failures... It's hard to watch. Was he referring to himself? Had he made a mistake? Was he preparing to fall? “Falling is inevitable, Bartholomew,” I said with deliberation, “everyone falls. Or is he really just... sympathetic?” “The important thing is how you get up, what you learn from it, what you make stronger. He had to laugh, and I laughed too.nodded slowly, but I could see the doubt lingering in his eyes. \"Easier said than done, sir.\" \"Perhaps,\" I conceded. \"But that's what separates the leaders from the... underlings, isn't it? The ability to rise after a fall.\" I paused, considering my next words. \"Tell you what, Bartholomew. If you're facing a particularly difficult fall, come and talk to me. I might not be able to catch you, but I can at least offer you a parachute.\" He looked surprised, then a small, genuine smile flickered across his face. \"Thank you, sir. I appreciate that.\" I nodded curtly, dismissing him with a wave of my hand. As he left",
        " Liam, who had previously been so easy-going and in the midst of the gaiety of his days, stood there with his brows knitted and his gaze directed somewhere behind my back. \" We need to talk,\" he said. I was speechless, my mouth wide open, and a moment later I heard the words hanging in the air, unspoken: “Is there something you’ve forgotten?” My thoughts rushed about like a hamster in a wheel, hoping to catch hold of something important. It was as if he were steeling himself against a storm, and I was standing right in its path. Real and imagined possibilities flew through my head. Had I said something that offended someone? Had I said something that offended someone? Liam shifted his feet, his hands shoved deep into his pockets. “Is everything... okay?” I finally managed to stammer, in a barely audible whisper. “Okay wouldn’t be exactly the right word,” he said in a voice that was somehow unfamiliar. “I’m sorry to have to say this, but... ” He finally met my eyes, and the seriousness in them made my stomach clench. My heart was pounding in my chest. “Thinking? I’ve been thinking a great deal lately.” We had been together for almost two years, and it all seemed... so very good. What were we thinking about? Was that the problem? It had been... easy. Safe. Liam drew a deep breath as if to steel himself. “I’ve been thinking about... about the future.” Had I gotten slack in my thinking? He fell silent and his eyes flickered off again. I knew with an awful certainty what he would say next. “About what I want. About where I see myself.” That was it. The world seemed to slow down, and the vibrant colors of the garden seemed to dull at once. The hamster in my brain stopped running. “And?” I asked, barely audibly. The end. “And... I’ve realized that we are headed in different directions.” He looked back at me, a mixture of guilt and something else I couldn’t quite make out. He reached for me, then hesitated, his hand hovering in the air before it fell back down to his side. “We want different things, and I don’t think we can afford to ignore it.” My hand flew up in response to his and I hung there for a moment, not sure what to do. “I’m so sorry, Maya.the air, heavy and final. The storm had arrived, and it was tearing everything I thought I knew apart. I opened my mouth to speak, to argue, to plead, but the words caught in my throat.

I don’t want to sit here and point fingers. I wonder whether you think about me too. Maybe life has pulled us apart. But this silence, the lack of an explanation, is gnawing at me. Or are you completely over me and are far away from my eternal “What if?” Do you regret anything? Do you remember anything with the same bittersweet longing? The past is past, but I’d like to know at least that you do. I know we can’t go back, but we could at least acknowledge it. Maybe that’s all I need.

        " Elias, his face and hair smeared with soot, was running a roughened finger over the rusty control panel. He could almost smell the departed operators, who for years had diligently tracked the paths of the trains through the underground labyrinth. Dust-motes were dancing in the single ray of sunlight that broke through the grimy ceiling of the deserted control-room. “Elie?” a voice cried from the doorway. There was a dead silence, broken only by the trickle-drip-drip of the leaking water through the ancient concrete. Then the door was pushed open and Maya came into the room with her head-lamp blazing. She was clutching a torn map, whose lines were faint and illegible. “More of the same, Elias. Frozen dials, sluggish levers, a dream from the past.” They had been born under the city, among the denizens of the underground, where the train-lines, which they called “the veins,” were their sole preoccupation. The tunnels and the trains were part of their lives, a source of an ever-expanding store of stories, and their knowledge of the history of the city – underground and buried in the rubble – was the very centre of their life. “The Records Department could only find one solitary newspaper report from 1904. And even that was only an announcement of a ‘grand engineering achievement’ and there was nothing more. No maps, no dates, nothing.” Perhaps it was built under a different name, or under a different ownership. Perhaps it was built for a purpose that was long forgotten. “Someone wanted it forgotten, Elias. Or at least forgotten, perhaps forgotten.” Elias tapped on one of the largest dials, whose function was now quite obscure. “This isn’t just about the history, Maya. This is about understanding the very foundations of the city.” He turned, looking round the ruined room. Then a subterranean rumble vibrated the floor. “Oh my God!” Maya’s hand flew to her mouth. “If we understand the Veins, we will understand ourselves.”her mouth. \"What was that?\" she whispered, her eyes wide. Elias held up a hand, silencing her. He strained his ears, his heart pounding against his ribs. The rumble grew louder, closer. It was the unmistakable sound of a train. But there hadn't been a train on The Veins in decades. He grabbed Maya's arm, pulling her towards the back of the control room. \"We need to get out of here,\" he said, his voice tight with urgency. \"Now.\"",

        " Mme Henderson had, it was clear, been a great fan of it. There was a great deal of it, piled in porcelain bowls in the shape of cherubs and set on crocheted lace that looked like cotton spiderwebs. The room was filled with dust and a faint odour of potpourri, which I associated more now with death than life. Was any of this precious to her? I rummaged through a box of costume jewellery that was piled to the top: a plastic pearl with a yellowish tinge, a rhinestone brooch in the shape of a poodle, clip-on earrings that could rip an ear-lobe off. A woman with a bobbed haircut and a sharp-eyed stare elbowed me aside and snatched a tarnished silver locket. Did she remember wearing it, the fun, the good company, the way she felt she was shining? Or was it just a relic? I looked at her, a cold feeling in my stomach. ‘ Bang!’ she exclaimed, examining it in the dappled light that filtered through the lace-curtain. ‘This could be a find, perhaps old silver.’ Or was she just another vulture picking the bones clean of a life that was no more? Had I missed something? Was I too preoccupied with the melancholy to be able to see the value? Deeper in the box, I touched something cool and smooth. A velvet bag, which I opened, and found in its faded lining a tiny glass bead, a piece of sea-glass. It was not valuable in the way the woman with the bobbed haircut was looking for. But it was beautiful. Emerald green, smoothed by the inexorable passage of the waves. This bead, this little relic of the sea, was more than a relic, more than an object to be sold at a flea-market. It was a memory, the remains of a life that had lived outside of potpourri and poodle brooches. Suddenly I saw Mme Henderson young and vigorous, a seashore full of treasures. I held the sea-glass in my hand, dipped it into the perfumed sachet.to the light, the green glowing like a tiny beacon. Maybe, just maybe, some things were worth more than their weight in silver. Maybe the real value wasn't in the price tag, but in the story they held. And maybe, just maybe, finding those stories was worth a damn after all.",
        " My head thumped a plaintive protest against the suspected decoctions I had consumed the previous night. A sharp, incessant buzzing penetrated my skull like a hammer drill. I moaned and plunged my face deeper into the pillow, but it was useless. Slowly, agonizingly, I flung open my eyes. The room appeared before me, a drowsy, distorted version of reality. I remembered the tequila shots, the pink cocktails with names I no longer knew, and a suspicious green liquid of Chloé's: the symphony of regret resounded in my brain. With an effort, I pushed the button that reset the alarm clock. A vague smell of hairspray and cheap perfume lingered in the air, reminding me of the ghost of the night. My clothes lay on the floor, a testimony to the hasty undressing that had taken place in the early hours. The clock was my relentless enemy, and I was a weak warrior. A merciful silence descended, but it was only temporary. I needed a plan. My best bet was a shower; or at least a large glass of water. But whatever I did, I must not, I must never again let Chloé in the vicinity of a drink.",
        " A silence had fallen over the crowd, a heavy, suffocating silence which seemed to crush me under its burden. My hands trembled as I arranged the rope. The hemp cord, so rough and unfeeling, was a different feeling from the silky softness of the scarves that I usually wore. Why? This was the unanswerable question that went round and round in my head like a remorseless refrain. I felt their eyes, thousands of eyes full of judging pity and morbid curiosity, boring into me. Was it a last bid for publicity, a desperate, theatrical gesture? Or was it something deeper, a surrender to the blackness that had been gnawing away at my soul for so many years? Why had I chosen this path? Could they really understand? I looked out into the sea of faces and saw them expressing a whole gamut of emotions: surprise, fear, morbid curiosity and even some pity. I looked for a face that was familiar, a voice, someone to talk to, anyone to tell me to reconsider, but all I saw was unfamiliar faces, eyes blazing in the light, undifferentiated and blurred. Could anyone understand the unbearable heaviness that had brought me to this point? A huge figure, shrouded in darkness, advanced towards me, a man who was hugely tall, with an expressionless face, his eyes unfeeling. He held the white cloth ready to blindfold me. My throat was parched, my tongue heavy. “Any last words?” he asked, a dull, resonant voice, which barely penetrated the silence. I could only whisper, barely audible, barely audible to myself, and I felt my throat grow dry. I wanted to cry out, to beg for forgiveness and beg for another chance, but I could not find the words. I shut my eyes and a tear trickled down my cheek. The executioner was waiting patiently, without shifting his gaze. “I... I... ” I opened my eyes and looked at the crowd. What was it I wanted to say, what truth must I reveal before the darkness consumed me? But I could not find the words. The crowd was still there, eyes staring expectantly, waiting.And in that moment, I knew what I had to say. But could I say it? Could I break free from the shackles of despair and find the courage to speak my truth? The clock was ticking.",
        " The neon-lit, Venusian resort, the place I swore I would never return to, but desperation, guilt and a burning need for answers, overrules all oaths. A stolen starship is just as fast, and I stole one to take me to my final destination. I cut the engines, and the silence, after the humming of hyperspace, is deafening. Her ship, sleek and black, a serpent-class interceptor, docked in the opulent Spaceport Royale, while my own, a ramshackle freighter, dubbed the Rusty Bucket, sits like a beggar in the palace. This place crawls with alien scum, from bounty hunters to criminals. I keep my hand on the personal shield button. He’s the one who told her everything. That’s why she’s stealing this ship. To sell it, I suppose. He gave her the security code that allowed her to steal it. And now she’s gone. What will happen now? Disappear? Or something far worse? I step out of the Rusty Bucket into the synthetic air of Venus. I must find her. I must know the truth. My final hope. I pull my cloak collar higher and try to fade into the crowd of holiday makers and smugglers. Neon lights dazzle my eyes. What is she after? I have to find out, before it’s too late. And her, apparently.",
        " “Fine, fine, I’ll go with it, eh? So, so we’ve been stuck up to our necks in the temporal muck of this century, with its strange paradoxes, its gnawing at our brains, our sleep being haunted by the grandfather paradox, and our causality being brought into question by the bootlace paradox... What’s it all about?” What’s the real question we’re trying to answer? Is it just to have something to think about or to do something with our mental gymnastics?",
        " ‘The first time I saw the numbers I was six years old. Our elderly neighbour was struggling to carry a grocery-bag up the stairs of her front-porch. I went over to help her, and that was when I saw it: a digits’ halo just above her grey head. It read: 0; 3; 1; 7; 22. Of course I tried to find out what it meant. “What number is that above Mrs. Henderson’s head?” I asked my parents. “Darling, there’s nothing there,” my mother replied, patting my head. But I had seen it. They looked at me with the mistrusting smile that grown-ups usually give when a child reveals his phantoms. The numbers were always there, above everyone’s heads. Sometimes they were long, they ran on into years, decades even. I always saw them. I quickly learned to keep my mouth shut. What good was a secret that no one else saw? Sometimes they were terribly short: just hours or minutes. The old lady died three days, seventeen hours and twenty-two minutes after I had seen the digits above her head. As I grew older, I began to recognize the signs. The digits were countdowns. I became a silent observer, a reluctant prophet, laden with everyone’s mortality. The weight of this knowledge was immense. It was chilling confirmation. I tried to forget about it and live a normal life. But the numbers were always there, the perpetual reminders of the tenuousness of existence. I saw my parents’ long, healthy lives and felt a sudden sense of relief, followed by the uneasy feeling that anything could happen. But sometimes I couldn’t ignore it. Sometimes the numbers were too short, the time limit too pressing to be ignored. I learned to filter it out of my mind unconsciously, to ignore the death-counts above people’s heads and to be able to engage in normal conversation and social activities without thinking of the imminent end of the person’s life. I didn’t hesitate. I cried, “Stop!” Then I didn’t hesitate. The number above her head flashed and then reset to a much longer figure. That day I saved someone’s life. But sometimes I didn’t.I also opened a Pandora's Box. The guilt, the responsibility, the sheer terror of knowing when someone's time is up... it's a heavy burden. Now, I'm 25. I work as a librarian, surrounded by stories of lives lived and lost. The numbers still haunt me, but I've learned to live with them, to navigate the world with this strange, unwanted gift. But lately, something’s been different. A new kind of number has started appearing. It’s not",

        " The wind was howling a lamentable dirge, reechoing the emptiness of the dead land. A gust of wind, filled with dust, howled along the dead plains of Trilokagnghzar. It stung the skin with the ferocity of a thousand needles, a constant reminder that one's existence in this world was an enmity against time and a constant fight for survival. Although the dry shrubs and bushes that had been twisted and torn apart by the storms of countless centuries stood as if afloat on a wave of ochre and grey, the furious wind beat them with a constant rhythm. Visibility was reduced to mere feet, and everything seemed to have disappeared in a whirlpool of ochre and grey. Someone in a dark tattered robe, barely distinguishable from the rolling dunes, leant into the wind and walked. He was carrying a spear. Everything that had lived in this land had been buried in the sand, and the unforgiving nature of Trilokagnghzar was manifest in its unrelenting sandstorms. If this man were a scavenger, a wanderer, or just a ghost wandering through the dusty ruins of a dead civilisation, Trilokagnghzar kept its secrets to itself, revealing only the harshness of existence. His eyes, masked by the dark goggles of glass scavenged from a broken mirror, scanned the lonely plains for something that could offer him protection, some kind of salvation. The sound of the howling wind and the blinding dust seemed to be doing its best to envelope the lone figure in its folds.",
        " “Yes, Dr. Fish,” he said, and leaned back in his chair, across the desk from me.

        " The dull, obstinate throbbing of his head and heart, already beginning to blossom in his bowels, made him feel sick. His eyes were closed, and the gnarled carpet scratched his cheek. The daylight was feebly slanting in through a crack in the curtains. He lifted himself up, and a stinging pain shot through his lower back. The night was coming to an end. He remembered a noisy party, loud music, and tequila shots, which were not from the best bottles. He looked around in his familiar jumble of clothes, half-empty water bottles, and books that had overflowed from his night table. Usually he felt very much at home in such a chaos. Now, however, he would be stumbling about like an octogenarian for the whole day. He would take care of it later. Now it seemed oppressive. He shambled toward the bathroom, his feet sticking a little to some sticky, mysterious substance on the floor. He braced himself up, and turned on the light. The face he saw in the mirror was pale, puffy, and bloodshot. He had to face the music now—the music was his reflection. He groaned again, and this time, louder. “It’s because of you,” he muttered to the mirror. He looked like a raccoon that had been beaten by a lawnmower. He had to have coffee—lots of coffee. He splashed his face with cold water—that brought momentary relief. He hoped he had enough Advil. This was going to be a long day. And a breakfast burrito the size of his head.",
        " The anteroom is cramped, small. Outside, the rain falls in a constant, blurring curtain that darkens the already gloomy daylight. INT. OF ARR. – DAY – A few small flowers bloom on the linoleum floor, a faded and worn rug, the pattern rubbed off; a rickety clothes stand leans against the wall, weighed down with raincoats and dripping umbrellas. A slight musty smell. The sound of a key being turned in a lock, the door creaks and there stands Anna (late 20s), looking pale and strained, the rain dripping from her hair on her forehead. The only light, a naked bulb on the ceiling, casts a feeble yellow light which scarcely dispels the shadows that cling to the corners. (Anna to herself: ‘Splendid.’) She shuts the door hard against the wind and a gust of icy air suddenly rushes through the anteroom. Anna shivers, pulling her thin raincoat tighter around her. She looks around the cramped space, examining the surroundings, which are familiar, yet oppressive. (Anna to herself: ‘Fine.’) She kicks off her sodden boots, leaving puddles of mud on the linoleum. Anna looks resigned, something heavy seems to be weighing her down. A long, drawn-out sigh comes from her lips, a white cloud in the cold air.",
        " Disorientation lay over me like a shroud. I awoke with a start. The shrill alarm was a sudden, angrily unwelcome in the hazy dream. My heart pounded against my ribs, like the heart of an unruly, relentless drumming ant. I got up, leaned against the narrow planks, and banged my head against the low ceiling with a painful bang. Where was I? And most important, why were those horns blaring? My eyes roamed the familiar surroundings: the metal walls, the fixed table, the folded uniform hanging on the hook. I let out a curse, groped for the switch. The fluorescent lamp flared up and illuminated the small cabin with its harsh, yellowish light. The horns roared at full throttle, a mad, high-pitched screaming that made my skull spin. This was my refuge, deep in the bowels of Leviathan. But something was terribly wrong. “Intrusion alarm,” came a guttural voice, barely audible above the hubbub of the horns. The last sleep slumbered in my eyes. I snatched the uniform from the hook and hastily put it on, my hands fumbling with the buttons in my haste. “Gamma Seven, breach of integrity. All hands to battle stations. They’re only a few decks down from me. Repeat, all hands to battle stations.” We were deep in the Kepler 186 system, far from any support, and a breach of integrity could mean anything from a leaky hull to a total disaster. Breaches of integrity—I was horrified. The fight against the cold, hard fear of doom pierced the buzz of my adrenaline. I shoved the boots on without tying the laces, grabbed my helmet from the shelf, and while I was adjusting the straps, the world contracted, concentrating on the immediate, on the task at hand.surviving. The *Leviathan* was in trouble, and I had a job to do. I just prayed it wasn't already too late.",
        " It was just like this. The red and blue neon lights of the Rosy Diner throbbed erratically, saturating the street with little blue and pink pulsations. The rain-soaked asphalt smelled of a strange mixture of coolness and grit. He was late again. My knuckles whitened on the worn leather cover of the diary, the one filled with poems and half-written stories.",
        " I was chilled by an ancient sense of foreboding, that kind that whispers of disaster. A rumble vibrated the floor under my feet, and I felt that something was happening. I suspected that it was bad. The growling sound was becoming more and more sonorous and resounded through my marrow. I looked around at the familiar stalactites and stalagmites, which seemed menacing in the flickering light of the torch. What was happening? Was it a landslide? My heart was pounding in my chest, like a frenzied drumbeat in the sudden silence that followed each rumbling. I clung to the cold steel of my pickaxe handle, which afforded me some comfort against the mounting anxiety. A landslide, or something else? The air was choking with a stench of earth, with something else too, something sharp and strange. My eyes darted from shadow to shadow, searching for the cause of the disturbance. The rumble deepened, assuming the quality of a guttural roar, and I took a step backward, gripped by fear. A spidery crack was running through the wall in front of me. In the dark I could make out a single crimson eye. The crack widened and I could see only a chink, a chink that grew and grew and grew, until it opened into a wide gap.",
        " He looked back, his eyes straying from shadow to shadow. The flickering lamp cast long, dancing shadows on the wall, making it difficult to distinguish whether they were real or whether they reflected his own fear. “We don’t have much time,” he said, his voice sharp with urgency. “They’re coming. I don’t know how much time we have, but we must leave. And quickly.” He gripped my arm, but not gently. He looked wild, desperate. The rain began to fall, suddenly, and a gout of black hair covered his forehead. I hardly knew this man; we had met less than an hour ago in the back room of Serpent’s Kiss, a rather nasty place I had tended to avoid. I was struck by his panic, and I felt the same panic myself. “What is happening?” I said to him. He had come up to me, whispering about a conspiracy, a secret that could change everything. I had been dubious, but his intensity had been alluring. He didn’t answer. I was trying to keep my voice steady. The rain was already soaking through my coat, and my whole body was cold. “Just trust me,” he said, catching his breath. “Just trust me.” He pulled me further down the lane, passing garbage cans and cardboard boxes. “We must get to the clock tower. It’s the only place we’ll be safe.” “Safe from what?” I asked him. But he kept pulling me along, his eyes imploring me, and something inside me, a heedless curiosity, perhaps, made me follow him. He stopped abruptly, his face grim. “From people who want to kill us both.” I hurried on, stumbling on a loose cobblestone.",
        " The words hung in the air, heavy, thick, like the humidity of the court. The judge’s voice came across: But Elias did not move. He had expected it. A sort of yelp, a sort of wave of fear, rose from the gallery, only to be answered by the stone, the impassive face of Elias. He had prepared himself, he had gathered his strength for the inevitable. But, even with the preparation, the brutal shock was cold, icy. The circumstantial evidence was complete, definitive. The answer was: Death. Extinction. To stop existing. The hammer fell. The sound, sharp, decisive, echoed the end of the sentence. “The death penalty will be carried out by injection, by sunrise, in a week’s time, within the walls of Blackwood. May God have mercy on your soul.” Elias didn’t look at the people in the gallery. He let them take him by the arms and walk him out through the back door. The sheriffs stepped forward, their faces set in determination. Elias saw his lawyer, Sarah, on the other side of the courtroom. He did not want to see the pity, the fear, the judgement. He was watching the peeling wall, the dust in the sunlight, coming in through the muddied window. She made a slight movement, barely noticeable, with her head. He gave her a quick return nod, his own eyes dark, grateful. Her face was white, her eyes full of a mixture of beaten defeat and a despairing glimmer of hope. A week. A week. Seven days. 168 hours. He knew he was innocent. 168 hours to breathe, think, feel. 168 hours to make his peace with his life and with the death that was coming to him. He was caught in a web of lies and deception. But to break it, it seemed an impossible task. He knew that he had been framed.so tightly that it threatened to suffocate him. As he was ushered into the cold, sterile confines of the holding cell, a single thought, sharp and clear, pierced through the fog of despair: He had to find a way out. He had to fight. He had to prove his innocence, even if it meant facing death itself. Seven days wasn't much, but it was all he had. And he wasn't about to waste a single second of it.",
        " (Focus on safety and grounding): * Find a quiet and safe place: keep away from crowds, noise and anything that might act as a trigger. A calm, quiet and familiar place is best. * If a psychedelic drug has left you confused, frightened and confused, it is important to remember that this is usually a temporary state, even if it may not feel like it. If possible, contact a friend or family member, a sober companion or someone who has experience with these trips and who can help you to reassure and stay rooted. You may also find it helpful to dim the light. * (Attention to the breath): Conscious, deep and slow breathing can help to stabilize your nervous system. Try \"box breathing\" (in for four, hold for four, out for four, hold for four) or just pay attention to the feeling of your breath entering and leaving your body. If you are alone and feel in danger, contact the ambulance. * (Grounding): use your senses to link with reality: * (Touch) : hold something that is reassuring, like a soft blanket, a stuffed animal or a smooth stone. Feel its texture and weight. * (Smell): smell calming smells like lavender, lemon or peppermint. * (Sound): listen to calming music or sounds from nature. * (Taste): sip on water or a calming herbal tea, like chamomile or ginger tea. Avoid sugary or caffeinated drinks. * (Avoid overthinking): Try not to analyze the experience in the heat of the moment, but rather focus on the present and what you can do to feel better. * (Reassurance): repeat reassuring sentences, such as \"It will pass,\" \"I'm safe,\" \"I'm fine,\" \"I'm temporary\" or \"I can breathe freely.\" * (Hydrate): drink plenty of water. * (Rest): lie down if possible.

        " Bacon, a seasoned pro, was cast as a wizened old head, and the fresh-faced Gertz oozed boyish charm as the young artist who won the heart of the old master. It was destined to be a great success, and its posters and trailers were drenched with a neon glow, displaying the wild world of bicycling messengers and the adrenaline-driven life they led. But between the marketing and the opening weekend, something went terribly wrong. Early screenings began to generate the first rumblings of discontent. The blaring, beat-driven music was topping the charts. But the muddled plot threads, clumsy action scenes, and a sense of emotional detachment from the story—particularly the love story between Jack (the hero) and Terri—drew a blank. Viewers who had been lured in by the energetic visuals and infectious music found themselves increasingly confused by the murky plot—something about a takeover, a dark Wall Street cabal, and delivering a mysterious package before dawn. A dizzying display of neon lights and nonsense, one critic lamented. A further review called it “A dull, wretched, off-the-wall effort, with neither style nor substance.” Its opening weekend was a complete disaster. Instead of ruling the charts, it barely scraped back a fraction of its massive marketing budget. And its shortcomings were exacerbated by the heft of the expectations it had raised. Why had it failed? It was a combination of things. The once-brilliant confidence of the studio’s executives had turned into stunned disbelief. And the marketing campaign, which had emphasized the film’s flamboyant visuals, had failed to convey what the film was actually about. The studio had forced more reshoots, and many scenes were cut out, destroying the structure of the film and leaving gaping holes in the storyline. Quicksilver faded from public view and sank into oblivion, a cautionary tale, a warning that even the most ambitious, promising project could be brought down by a combination of mismanagement, artistic compromises, and the whims of a fickle audience.d to late-night cable and dusty VHS tapes. Yet, years later, a small but dedicated cult following began to emerge. They saw in Quicksilver not a failure, but a flawed masterpiece, a visually stunning and strangely compelling glimpse into a bygone era. They appreciated its unapologetic cheesiness, its over-the-top action, and its surprisingly poignant exploration of ambition, friendship, and the struggle to find one's place in a rapidly changing world. Quicksilver, they argued, wasn't a box office hit, but it was something more: a cult classic, a film that, against all odds, had found its audience, however small, and earned its place in cinematic history. Its initial failure had inadvertently paved the way for its enduring legacy. The package, it seemed, had finally been delivered, albeit decades later, to a select few who",

        " We dig it up, we dig it out of quartz veins, we sieve it from river beds, we grind rocks and treat them with cyanide. But the real story, which geologists and conspirators alike whisper in the dark, is more complex. But the earth did not make the vast majority of the gold that we find on it. The earth did not give birth to it. We show it a savage, indifferent contempt. It is said that the stars made it. Before our sun was born, billions of years ago, the new galaxy resounded with the supernovas of colossal stars which ended their lives and which, crumbling on themselves, released an inexpressible energy. These explosions of stars sowed the universe with their matter, which would later form the constituents of planets and, ultimately, of life. And it was in the midst of these tumultuous moments of cosmic violence that the atoms heavier than iron were forged, and among them the precious, the desired gold. When our solar system was born, the dust of the stars, the dust of the suns, took shape and made up the planets of today. But the real delivery service, the one which brought the gold down to the crust where it was later to be found, was the continuous asteroid and meteorite bombardment. However, the vast majority of gold was locked up in the earth's interior, and was not accessible to us. The great impact that gave birth to the moon, a cataclysmic clash with a Mars-sized object, was believed to have shaken the molten depths and brought some of this celestial product closer to the surface. We had to open the earth and thus have it. And so, the next time you see a ring of gold gleaming, or a gold bar locked up in a cellar, remember that it is not only an earth product; it is a piece of the flame of the universe, the echo of the expiring breath of old stars, a testimony to the brutal and beautiful history of the universe. The celestial bodies, laden with gold, forged by supernovas, pounded the young earth, bringing down the precious merchandise on its surface. And this dust of the stars was thus brought to the earth, buried in the earth, destined to be taken out, to be found, to be dispersed.more. And that, they say, is the real story.",

A strange dream, incoherent, stuck to the back of my head, confused, a flying squirrel in a top hat, an old gnome with disapproving eyes, advising me on how to butter toast. I stayed there for a moment, heavy with a lump of inertia, refusing to be moved. My friend, sleep, was slipping away. Then, suddenly, an unfamiliar sound entered my senses: a rhythmic thud. * Thud. I shivered to free myself from this torment, but couldn’t. Thud. A smell, a faint smell of something burning, like the sound itself, but with a difference: it rang a primordial warning in my brain. Thud. I fell from my bed, rushed towards the stairs, rolled away from the absurd image of the gnome, pushed forward by the smell of kitchen disaster. “Toast!” I cried, bursting into movement.",

A voice, still murmuring, cracked the air. The little ifrit I had called, a mere puff of smoke barely above my knee, was trembling violently. His eyes were like pools of liquid gold, searching into me, searching for something lost or hidden. He wore a velvet coat of many colors, his top hat teetering on a tangled mass of red-gold hair. \"I... I called you, sir,\" the little ifrit was murmuring, his voice a trembling whisper. Obviously, I was not the one he had expected. He could see that I was in a hurry, and could see that he did not want to lose time. He threw back his head and laughed like a thousand shrieking fires. \"I wanted... help...\" Help? Me? This is rich. He leaned down, his face was a hideous caricature of a smile. \"Go ahead, spill your guts. What help could a sprite such as you possibly need from someone... let us say, from a friend of the inferno?\" The little ifrit, obviously frightened, was squeaking: \"I... I am being bullied. I haven't laughed so hard since I tricked a bunch of goblins into thinking that lemonade could be made with sulfuric acid.\" The tall figure straightened up, and stopped laughing. \"A brigand salamander keeps stealing my brimstone.\" A small growl started, then a deep, hollow laugh, more sinister than the first. \" Brimstone!\" There was a long, heavy silence, only broken by the crackle of his flaming hair. Then, he roared: \"Let him come, then, to me, where I can find him., clutching his stomach. \"He steals your *brimstone*! Oh, the audacity! The sheer... *banality*! This is magnificent! A salamander stealing brimstone. It's so... perfectly, hilariously, *pathetic*! Tell me, little spark,\" he said, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper, \"does this salamander have a name?\" The little ifrit, trembling even harder, whimpered, \"Scales... he calls himself Scales.\" The tall figure's molten eyes narrowed. \"Scales, you say? Well, Scales is about to learn a very valuable lesson. A lesson about the proper etiquette of brimstone acquisition. A lesson... that will be *thoroughly* unpleasant.\" He snapped his fingers, and a tiny spark of flame danced in his palm. \"Come, little ifrit. Lead the way. Let's pay our friend Scales a visit. And bring a spare",
        " It’s an irritant; but not yet a problem. It could mean that someone has a medical emergency, like someone having a seizure or is choking. The implication is that the speaker is relaying the information to an authority figure, like a doctor or policeman, and needs guidance; the “Please continue” indicates that the authority figure is requesting more information. “The person is foaming at the mouth. Please continue. Do you want me to do CPR?” “The person has blue lips. Please continue.” The tone is neutral, detached, clinical. “Possible Scenario:” someone is observing animals or objects in a controlled environment. “The larvae are flailing their little bodies, sir. Please continue.” The implication is that the speaker is relaying the information to a researcher or supervisor, who is directing the experiment. “Please continue. Shall I adjust the temperature?” The tone is sarcastic, ironic, and dry. “Possible Scenario:” the situation is intentionally absurd or humorous. “The fish we bought are flopping around on the floor, sir. Please continue.” The implication is that the speaker finds the situation ridiculous, but is obliged to report it; the “Please continue” is a sarcastic prompt for the authority figure to make senseless requests. “Please continue. Shall I teach them to swim in the air?” “The fish have been fed too many fries and need to be returned to the water.” “Possible Scenario:” the troops are under fire and the enemy is lying dead on the ground.

        " A congenial silence ensued, broken only by the crackling of the embers and the sighs of the company. Glasses, some half-full, others empty, were arranged on the mahogany table, reflected the fire and cast off in it a red luster. The laughter was fading, becoming dim in the golden rays of the crackling fire. But suddenly a voice broke through the stillness: \"Ah! alas! enough,\" it murmured in a low voice, \"we've made our merry way through this darkness, let's have some more secrets!\" As she leaned back in her tufted chair, still laughing, her eyes flashed with an insolent gleam, \"where are the rest of the secret?\" cried one of the old men, a distinguished gentleman, with a soft smile and a silver-tongue. \"Eleanor, you are unregenerate,\" he said to her. \" The last time we played this game I almost gave away the secret of my... of my youthful indiscretions.\" A laugh, at once playful and prudent, resounded through the room. \"But, Thomas,\" she added, lowering her voice again, \"I have a very fat one on hand. A little harmless discomfiture never hurt anyone. I think you'll find it rather... interesting.\" Then intrigue was seen to flit over the faces of the others, that powerful, irresistible force. \"Intriguing, you say? Speak!\" Margaret, a woman of the quickest wits and sharpest of eyes, raised her eyebrows. Then, like a snake, a smile spread over her face, for the old woman, ever the provocative one, smirked. They laughed at the recollection of a rather passionate, if somewhat insipid, recitation of a ribald limerick, which she had rendered last week. \"But promise me that you will not begin another questionable poetry, as you did the other day.\" \"This time I won't. I promise you; this is quite pure gossip. It concerns...\" She paused, casting her eyes round the circle of expectant faces. \"It concerns a missing necklace of diamonds, a celebrated woman, and... \"art critic, and a very suspicious poodle.\" The room erupted again, this time with gasps of surprise and murmurs of eager anticipation. The evening, far from winding down, was only just getting started. The fire crackled merrily, the wine flowed freely, and the air crackled with the promise of secrets yet to be revealed. The mirth of the evening, it seemed, was far from over.",
        " Here’s what I think first: “Who is speaking? What a wonderful, suggestive snippet! It arouses a keen sense of expectation and mystery.” The word “back” suggests something behind, hidden or hesitant, and “imploring” is the sound of a desperate plea. “What’s this about? A story? An action? Something perilous?” “Why are they imploresing?” The missing context is provocative. Here are a few possibilities, depending on the kind of story you want to tell: “Please.... I’m terribly afraid of what will happen if it stops. I’m really terribly interested in what happens next.” It’s imploring from behind. The shaman’s eyes are shut tight. The chanting stops. In the flickering candlelight, the faces of the circle are covered with fear and expectation. The air crackles with invisible electricity. He hesitates, takes a deep breath and speaks in a hushed voice: “As you wish....” It’s imploring from behind. A small, trembling hand reaches out from behind the velvet curtain. A young face, white and tear-stained, peers into the dark theatre. Please.... Imploring from behind. The little voice was almost a whisper, and it was lost in the rustling of the crowd. Imploring from behind. Imploring from behind. “I assure you, Mrs. Henderson, I intend to do it. And here’s the story: It’s imploring from behind.” In any case, you’ve got a good starting point. But the problem is complex and needs careful explanation.",
        " \"Karl, look,\" I whispered, in a feeble whisper. My throat felt rough. I swallowed, tried to drive out the lump of fear that was lodged there. He stepped closer to me and the space between us narrowed, as if pressed between us. \" Come on, just talk to me...\" He laughed, and his smile seemed to expand like a taut rubber band on his face. \" Talk?\" I instinctively backed up and my heel hit the brick wall behind me. I was caught. \" What do you want to talk about, little boy? You owe me a lot of money...\" he chuckled, a low, guttural sound that made my chest flutter. I had guessed that. He spoke of it as if it were self-evident, as if I should have fallen at his feet with a wad of banknotes in my hand; and perhaps I should have. \"I... I told you I was able to pay...\" I stammered, as if that would delay the matter. I had hoped – I had always hoped I could get away with it somehow. Karl tipped his head back and looked at me with his hard, narrow eyes, as if he were about to squish me like a fly. \" Wait a week, and I'll get it from you, I promise.\" \" A week? You said that last week, and the week before... Promises don't pay, boy...\" He grasped my arm with his thick, rough hand, a surprising gentleness, yet with an ominous menace. \" I'm a patient man, you know.\" My heart beat against my ribs. \" But I don't like it when people lie to me.\" \"I'm not lying, but I... it's just a little tight... a little tight...\" I felt the perspiration on my forehead. \" Tight? But I'm working on it, I swear!\" His hand pressed harder. \"It's not tight, is it? This is worse than tight, isn't it? This is you pulling a trick on me.\" He leaned forward and his breath was on my face, the stale smell of cigarettes and something else I could not quite make out.'t quite place, hot on my face. \"Tell me the truth. You got the money, or you don't?\" The truth. The truth was I'd spent it. Every last dime. On a stupid, reckless gamble that had only left me deeper in the hole. And now I was staring down the barrel of Karl's displeasure. I closed my eyes, bracing myself. \"I... I don't have it.\" The grip on my arm tightened to the point of pain.",

        " The man, named David, seemed to be unaware of the entire scene and was already busy comparing two different brands of organic pasta sauce. The woman, Amelia, smiled thinly and watched the man walking off with his cart; it was a practiced smile, a smile that she had mastered after years of tense encounters. This was good. That meant he hadn’t noticed the slight tremor in her hands as she grasped the handle, nor the glare in her eyes as she stared for a moment at his face. A seemingly innocuous action, a chance encounter in the sterile, brightly lit aisles of a grocery store. The execution of her carefully planned strategy. And this cart-exchange was the keystone. Underneath the pile of grocery items, the bag of apples, the loaf of sourdough, the carton of almond milk, lay the tools of her trade. Sharp tools, implacable tools. He was a creature of habit, Amelia knew. He always shopped on Tuesdays at six, he always bought the same brand of coffee, he always used the same dingy shopping cart, the left wheel of which never failed to squeak. It wasn’t the shopping cart that David had departed with that was important, but the one he had left behind. It smelled faintly of him, of sandalwood-scented soap and something vaguely metallic. And above all, he always carried the same worn leather wallet, bulging with bills. A moment later, he would have his money. Then, unnoticed, behind a crease in one of the crumpled boxes of cereal, in a crevice, in the diaper-bag stuffed to overflowing, she pulled out a pair of black gloves. Slipping them on, she felt around among the diapers, the baby wipes, the crumpled Cheerios boxes, until she found his wallet, still cool and damp from his sweating. Inside, among the crisp bills and the faded photographs, was a small, folded piece of paper. A doctor’s appointment card. She opened the wallet with trembling hands. This wasn’t part of the plan. David Miller, 6:00 PM, Oncology Clinic. Her stomach twisted in dismay. She had chosen him only because he was poor.because he seemed... successful. A man who could afford to lose a little. She hadn't considered... this. Suddenly, the air around her felt thick, suffocating. The fluorescent lights seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy. She remembered the stories her grandmother used to tell, whispered in hushed tones on stormy nights. Stories of bargains struck in dimly lit places, of wishes granted at a terrible price. Stories of things that lurked in the shadows, waiting to collect their due. She'd dismissed them as old wives' tales, but now, standing in the middle of the supermarket, surrounded by the mundane trappings of everyday life, she felt a cold dread creeping into her bones. This wasn't just a robbery gone wrong. It was something",
        " Jack was looking for something, not a café, but a modern and fashionable place, a chrome-plated and glass-lined affair, he thought, to befit the sexiness of the game. A bowling alley was not what he expected. Instead, he found himself in a dimly lit room that reeked faintly of stale beer and something medicinal, as if the accumulated dirt of many decades was still resisting all the detergents and perfumes used to clean it. The walls were a sickly, chipped and faded green. The seats were velvety, and the waiters, immaculately dressed, served drinks. It was with the new girl, Sarah, that he had agreed to go, and she was so excited and told him about her childhood, when she was knocking down strikes and spares. The plastic of the chairs was brittle and sticky, and the automatic scoring system seemed to have been held together with a sling of tin foil. He saw her take her ball, slightly too tight in her bowling shirt, with her name stitched on the back. He had wanted to do something to surprise her, to be adventurous and open to new experiences, but this... this was not the rendezvous he had imagined. He gave an inner shudder. The ball was a lurid purple, and in the brittle plastic there were tiny little flecks of glitter. He was putting on his shoes and felt the wet, clammy, sticky soles against his socks. ‘Are you ready?’ she asked, her eyes shining with excitement. He smiled – he was ready as anyone ever would be. He was watching her go up to the line, smooth and confident, releasing the purple thing down the lane, and it rolled along, arcing and swaying and knocking down eight pins. The shoes were two sizes too big and made him feel like a clown. He was taking a deep breath, and he was going up to the line. Never, even as a child, had he bowled. ‘ Not bad!’ she cheered, clapping her hands. ‘Your turn!’ He took a heavy, black ball, smoothed from wear. It was foreign in his hands. He felt clumsy and awkward and completely out of his depth. He was watching his own hand.mimicked Sarah’s stance as best he could, took a few hesitant steps, and then launched the ball. It went straight into the gutter with a resounding *thwack*. Sarah didn't laugh, though. She just smiled encouragingly. \"Don't worry, it takes practice! Just try to keep your eye on the arrows.\" He sighed inwardly. Practice. He had a feeling he was going to need a lot of it. This wasn’t the glamorous escape he’d hoped for. It was gritty, it was loud, and it was definitely...real. And despite his initial reservations, as he looked at Sarah, her face alight with joy as she prepared for her next turn, a tiny seed of possibility began to sprout within him",
        " “Stupid dogs! get out of my way!” Brian called out, kicking a stray toy across the living room. A big, shaggy, lumbering, drooling bulldog, Brutus, ignored the command and continued to snore on the carpet. Brian was sick of those dogs. The tiny white fur ball, Princess Fluffybottom the Third, (it was his wife’s idea) whimpered pathetically and darted behind the sofa, tail between its legs. He trudged to the kitchen and snatched a coffee cup from the drying rack. He hated the way they shed hair everywhere, the way they stank, the way they followed his wife, Carol, around as if she were the queen of the dog world, and the way they kept tripping him up, especially when he was trying to work. “Carol, get those mangy beasts out of here! I nearly knocked the whole rack over, thanks to Princess Fluffybottom the Third, whose presence you can’t really see. She’s just a rag doll,” he growled. Carol, cheerfully humming, came into the kitchen, arms full of groceries. “Good morning, darling,” she chirped. “Did you have a good sleep?” she beamed at him, unaware of his seething anger. “No, I didn’t sleep very well at all.” He slammed the cup down on the counter, making her jump. “Oh, you silly thing! I dreamed I was being chased by a pack of vicious chihuahuas!” She started to unpack the groceries, still as cheerful as ever. “They’re not vicious at all! And Brutus is as gentle as they come!” “Sweet dreams! A gentle giant who makes me wear rubber gloves when I sit on the sofa. It’s a real hazard, I tell you!” He stared at her. “Brian, we don’t need any more dogs!” she exclaimed, a wrinkle between her brows.ve been over this. I love my dogs. They're part of the family.\" \"Well, they're not part of *my* family!\" he retorted, immediately regretting the words as they left his mouth. He knew this was a sore spot. He knew Carol loved those dogs more than anything. He just couldn't help himself. The frustration, the irritation, it all just boiled over. The silence that followed was thick and heavy, broken only by the gentle rustling of grocery bags. Brian braced himself for the inevitable lecture, the familiar refrain of \"You knew I had dogs when we got married, Brian!\" He just hoped he could make it through another day without completely losing it. He really did love Carol, but sometimes, those dogs... those damn dogs... they were enough to drive him mad.",
        " The wind was a constant companion, driving his threadbare garment, and bearing with it the smell of dust and dry earth; his face, all sun-beaten wrinkles, and marked with cares, gazed toward the horizon as if searching for some lost object, or perhaps, some object never yet found. The horizon lay like a great map of wrinkles; there was not a glimmer on the face; Some say he is a hermit, driven mad by loneliness. He carries nothing valuable, except his knotty staff, which serves as a stick, and also as a weapon; the wood, worn smooth by age, vibrates with a feeble, barely perceptible sound. He speaks little, and then in a low voice, and in short sentences that seem to hide more meaning than they tell. Some whisper that he is an exiled wizard, for a forgotten fault; others, that he is a guardian, sent to watch over the arid lands against unknown powers. He walks without a goal, but with a deep conviction, as if following an invisible path, guided by a musical rhythm only he can hear. Sometimes he warns a traveler of the dangers of some gorge, covered by the sand; or he blesses a dead tree, making a stubborn flower bloom. But, as long as he walks, the desert is not deserted; it is still a mysterious, powerful land, promising to be the land of an ancient and powerful future. He is a part of the desert, like the wind and the rocks, an eternal figure in an eternal desert.",
        " I’ve been in more private planes than most people see cars. It’s not that I don’t understand; I do. The thrill, the so-called adventure—all of that costs something. And I’m beginning to wonder whether I’m willing to pay the price. I’ve eaten in Paris at the poshest restaurants, taken a close-up look at the Amazonian jungle, and even studied the ways of a penguin in the Antarctic (and wore a tuxedo, naturally). I’m his secret weapon, his “lucky charm,” the one who, according to him, makes him rich and successful. I don’t doubt it: perhaps the exquisite stitching, the perfect finish, the very feel of me against his skin give him that certain self-confidence, that necessary ruthlessness, which lets him... well, suffice it to say, excel in acquiring things. But then, I’m just a simple leather glove, and often I’m the only witness to his methods. He’s a collector of things—of the rarest, the most valuable, the most...forbidden. I’ve been touched by things that whisper secrets in the dark. I’ve felt the chill as the vault door closed behind us, the clammy sweat on his palm as he slipped through the wire-mesh screens, and his sudden shortness of breath as he bypassed the final security measure. Tonight he’s wearing that dark blue, the color he wears when he’s doing something especially dangerous. And now, as he carefully lays me down on the polished mahogany desk next to a carefully folded silk scarf and a set of silver-plated lock-picks, I feel that familiar nervousness seeping into the fibers of my leather. I just hope I won’t have to soak up any more stains. Even the best leather polish won’t erase the memory of what I’ve seen. And I, the faithful silent companion, wait for the new adventure.",

        " So that's what it's like! So that's what it's like! The colours! thought John. He had not expected this. And suddenly he had tears in his eyes, and with his blinking they made a kaleidoscope of the already dazzling landscape. A sense of completion, perhaps, a sense of pride. He expected... what, precisely? But this... he had dreamed of the valley of the famous emerald, the legendary one, where the flowers of all colours and shapes of the rainbow were said to cover the floor, nourished by a crystal network of streams that shone like scattered jewels. And this... this was beyond all imagining. The hum of the unseen insects, a symphony of life that resounded in his chest. And it was true, it was more true than he had ever believed. He had lived in monochrome, and never knew. The clean air that was filled with the sweet smell of flowers, banishing the dust and weariness of the long climb, tasted on his tongue, felt on his skin, the gentle sun, he had never felt so good in his life. He wiped his eyes, ashamed of the tears, but they kept coming. How much he had been missing, with his dulled senses! Now he was alive, in this riot of colours and sensations. He drew a deep breath, to steady himself. Was it tears of joy, of remembrance, of elation? Perhaps all three. He felt in his knapsack, took out his shabby little leather note-book and his graphite pencil. He must write this down. This amazing, this bewildering, dazzling, ecstatic beauty. He opened it to a blank page, and began to draw. The colours he couldn't keep, he couldn't keep, but he would keep the memory, and keep it safe from the invading greyness of everyday life. He would try to put it on paper, how it seemed to him. Not the flowers, not the rivers, but the light.danced across the valley floor, the way it seemed to breathe life into everything it touched. As he drew, the tears finally subsided, replaced by a quiet sense of peace. He was here. He had made it. And the world, in all its breathtaking beauty, was waiting to be discovered. He just needed to open his eyes and see it. He just needed to feel it. He just needed to let himself be overwhelmed. And he would. He would let himself be overwhelmed. He would let himself feel.",
        " In the air, dim and nervous voices, and the silver of the cutlery against the porcelain, rose a buzzing murmur. The candlelight, shimmering and changing, masked the faces of my fellow diners, so that I could not discern their features. My eyes darted around the table to take in the scene. It was uncanny; the stiff formality of the atmosphere, the hardness of the smiles on their faces, the nervous movements of Lord Ashworth in adjusting his neck-cloth – everything seemed somehow out of place. In front of me lay a half-eaten roast pheasant, whose fragrance was now dulled by the lingering smell of the crockery, which was not quite clean. My eyes rested on a dagger, an heirloom doubtless, that lay next to his plate. I felt disturbed, almost intimidated.",
        " \"So,\" said the psychologist in her calm and even tone, which usually reassured me, \"you say you have been feeling...\" My eyes darted from the page to the spiral stairs and the grimaced suns, which crowded the margins of my hastily written notes. \"Disconnected... That's... too... polite,\" I murmured without looking up. The word seemed inadequate, a pale imitation of the gaping chasm that had opened up between me and everything that I had once enjoyed. \" Polite?\" she said gently. I pressed my pen harder on the paper, shading the already sinister grimaces of the suns. \" Hollow,\" I said, barely managing to say it, \"it's more like a hollow feeling, as if you were scooped out and there was just a hollow shell.\" Dr Petrovna bent forward with concern. I paused, tracing the spiral stairs with my pen, and trying to remember when was the last time I felt really myself. \" And when did you first notice this feeling, Lebedev?\" she asked, looking up with her eyes as though trying to see a star in a brightly lit room. Happy. Alive. Everything changed after the accident. \" Since the accident,\" I said, scarcely audibly, \"everything has changed since the accident.\" There was a silence. The accident. It was the abyss of truth that I had been walking around for weeks. The only sound was the ticking of the clock in the corner, a constant reminder of time and the ebbing of my life. \" Tell me about the accident, Lebedev,\" Dr Petrovna said gently, her voice full of compassion. \" What's wrong?\" I sighed again, very low and defeated. \"Do I have to tell you?\" I asked, knowing full well that I did. My sketchy notes suddenly seemed mocking, a childish attempt to fill the empty space. And the only way out was to work. That was my work, that was my suffering.",
        " Even at this ungodly hour the city seemed... different. The usual hush of a sleeping capital had been replaced by a disturbing silence, broken only by the sound of distant sirens and the crackle of wood-fires. The air was thick with an air of nervous expectation, much heavier than the damp summer air of Fredericton. Our small detachment—a mix of Navy SEALS and Royal Marines, some twenty of us in all—gathered in a cluster, heaving against our heavy packs in the dim light filtering through the low clouds. Lieutenant Commander Davies, built like a brick wall and with the calm authority of one, called out commands. We disembarked from the CH-46 Sea Knight, the sound of its rotors fading as it rose into the pre-dawn sky. “Seconds, Sergeant, radio our arrival to the designated contact. Patrol the perimeter. Lock down the landing zone.” The designated contact was our first enigma. We had been briefed on the news: general unrest, looting, clashes with the police. But the causes were unknown. Let’s get moving, gentlemen, we have no idea what we’re walking into. As we spread out, the silence increased our unease. Something about a controversial bill, and an economic downturn, and simmering tensions between the city’s various communities. The details were sketchy at best, and the urgency of our deployment implied the situation was far worse than any of us had been told. Serganet Miller, a scrawny Marine with a perpetual squint, was the first to succeed in communicating with our designated contact. The streets were deserted, save for the occasional wreckage—a shattered window, an overturned garbage can, an angry banner dangling from a tree—and the smell of burning wood, the acrid smell of burnt plastic, the nauseating smell of fear. “Nightingale to Whiskey-Tango-Six. Nightingale to Whiskey-Tango-Six, do you copy?” a scratchy voice replied after a pause.here. We read you Whiskey Tango Six. Welcome to the party.\" The voice was female, tired, and laced with a hard edge. \"Head to the legislature building. We're holding it, but barely. You're late.\" The legislature building. The heart of the city, and apparently, the center of the storm. Davies turned to us, his face grim. \"Alright, people. Lock and load. We're going downtown. Expect resistance. And remember your ROE – minimum force necessary, but don't hesitate to defend yourselves. Let's move out.\" The sun was beginning to bleed over the horizon as we started our trek towards the legislature, the silence broken only by the rhythmic thud of our boots on the pavement. We were walking into the unknown, into a city on the brink, and I couldn't shake the feeling that whatever awaited us was going",
        " He was standing at the window, his hands thrust into his pockets, staring out at the rain lashing against the panes. He had just had a terrible fight with his wife, and the silence in the apartment was heavy, as heavy as a clamour. He had never intended to say half the things he had said, they had just been building up for months, years, and had erupted with a fury. Each drop of rain seemed like a little reproach, like a reminder of his words, of his accusations. He turned and looked at her, on the sofa, huddled in a ball, facing away from him. The lava had cooled, and all that was left was a bleak, barren landscape of remorse. He knew he ought to apologise. He couldn’t see her face, but the air crackled with her suffering. A wave of shame and obstinacy surged up within him, inertia of the bloodstream. He should have gone to her, to try and explain, to repair the damage; but the words stuck in his throat. He thought of their life together, of their good times, of their laughter, of their shared dreams; had they been a charade? He gave his full attention to the rain, the drumming of the drops, allowing them to lull him into a kind of detachment. He knew in his heart that it was not so; they had created something real, something enduring. Had the love that he thought he shared with her been an illusion, destined to crumble under the pressure of the world? He took a deep breath, a cold shiver running through his whole body. He couldn’t stay like this, a prisoner in the darkness of the window. The world was too fragile for that, in danger of crashing in a ruinous way. The rain grew louder, in response to the turmoil in his heart. He had a choice to make: to stay in this place of mute disapproval, to let the bitterness grow, or to swallow his pride, to go to her and try to put things right. He turned away from the window, the decision taken. His steps were slow, his feet heavy with shame and guilt.mistakes.",
        " A nervous strain ran through the polished surface of these conferences. A contest took place beneath this varnished surface, in the secret ties, in the studied smiles, in the hurried, revealing glances, as of a tournament. Sweet perfumes jostled with the earthy and more natural odor of truffles and wine. The air vibrated with the fermented mingling of ambition, of the possibility of success, of successful hopes. A woman with eyes as sharp as blades, lips of flint, a sharp, dry laugh, held court near a window. A waiter, whose face was a mask of impassive neutrality, glided through the confused dance, holding delicate glasses filled with sparkling champagne that hissed like whispered secrets. A man with a receding hairline, wearing a tie untied precisely so, made a great gesture, and his voice was raised above the hum of the group. She leant toward the man next to her, and her hand, adorned with a diamond the size of a small pebble, lay possessively on his arm. He seemed fascinated, and a look of boredom or calculation flickered in his eyes. He looked at me with a slight, hardly perceptible nod, and I quickly averted my eyes, pretending to be interested in the magnificent bouquet of white orchids that adorned my table. I was surrounded by younger, agitated faces, who listened to him as if they were disciples at the feet of a sage. This was not a restaurant, it was a stage. I listened to the noise of my fork on my plate, and the sound of the fork seemed to be louder in the expectant silence. It was a stage of ambition, where fortunes were made and lost, where a shaken hand and a wink locked in an agreement, where a rumbling of unspoken desires threatened to boil over at any moment, and I was a silent observer waiting to see which play would be the first to begin.",
        " The ground, if I may call it that, was a chaos of color, a chaos of colors; the abyss of aphelion—an abyss, not of an object but of an essence; and time seemed to have been stretched out indefinitely. The wind blew by my ear, not the familiar wind of the earth but the wind of space, the howl of collapsing galaxies, the roar of dying stars. I tried to scream and cry for help; but my voice was snuffed out in the midst of the vastness, lost in the universal symphony of destruction. I saw nebulae blooming and fading like flowers that wither in an hour, their lively colors faded into the cold, sterile gray of entropy. The stars, which had once been the lighthouses of hope, were extinguished, blown out like candles in a hurricane. I was no more than a mote of dust in the unstoppable stream of time, falling toward the unknown. With every minute that passed, the familiar laws of physics seemed to crumble. A raw fear clawed at my throat, and choking me with my own insignificance. I saw entire civilizations born and die in the span of a moment. I saw colors I had never seen before, painting impossible geometries on the fabric of space. Even the idea of “down” became meaningless, and I fell everywhere and nowhere at once. I saw all the laughter and tears, all the triumphs and tragedies of all the beings that ever lived—a premonition of the transience of existence. Then a new sensation: I felt I was falling through a stone corridor, a stone corridor of infinity, of unimaginable distances, of an eternity of silence. My body was falling apart, torn apart, atom by atom; but I did not feel the pain, only an immense surrender. A cold pressure, like being squeezed in the fist of a giant. A light white light—then nothing.The universe was aging, and I was aging with it, becoming one with the decay, a tiny, insignificant part of the grand, inevitable entropy. I was falling, and as I fell, I was becoming nothing. But even in that nothingness, a strange, unsettling peace settled over me. Perhaps, in the face of such cosmic insignificance, there was a strange kind of freedom. Perhaps, in the end, all that remained was the fall itself. And the fall, I realized, was everything.",
        " I think this is why I volunteered to tidy up my grandfather's house. Everyone else was too heartbroken to even think of it. It was an immense task. My mother was staring blankly at the wall, my father was in a fog of liquor, and my siblings were in their rooms weeping. Dust motes were dancing in the sunlight that came through the smoky windows, illuminating the heaps of newspapers, piles of old National Geographic magazines, and boxes of rusting tools. My grandfather was a pack-rat, a keeper of things, never throwing anything out. Every room was like a memory-box, crammed with good and bad memories. As I packed old clothes and rotting food into black rubbish bags, it was like a part of him that I was throwing away, a memory that was being buried. For the first few days, I was on a whirlwind of activity, sorting things out and removing things from the house, filling the black bin liners. Then I found his workshop at the back of the house. It was a small, narrow room that smelled of oil and sawdust. A feeling of guilt gripped me, and I could feel a burning pain inside my chest. There were too many things strewn all over the workbench, the wood shavings had piled up too high on the floor. This was my grandfather's domain, his sanctuary, and it was a mess. There were wooden figurines and wooden utensils that had been carved by him and left half-finished, and antique pocket watches, each with the names of their previous owners written on them in pencil. When I began to clean up, I found more things, some precious, some not. I found a small wooden box buried under a pile of old sketches and plans. I was afraid to open it. It felt as though there was something terribly wrong with me for even considering it.I was intruding on something deeply personal, something Grandpa had kept hidden from the world. Inside, nestled on a bed of faded velvet, was a single photograph. It was a picture of my mother, young and radiant, her face beaming with happiness. In her arms, she held a baby. Me. On the back of the photograph, in Grandpa's shaky handwriting, were three words: \"My Greatest Joy.\" Suddenly, the guilt began to recede, replaced by a wave of something else. Something warmer, something softer. Understanding, perhaps. Maybe even forgiveness. Cleaning out Grandpa's house wasn't just about discarding his possessions. It was about rediscovering him, and rediscovering myself in the process. And maybe, just maybe, it was about finally letting go.",
        " “They” is not meant in the human sense, but rather black holes, huge singularities, performing a dance older than time. For billions of years they have been talking to each other, only speaking the droning, humming language of gravitational waves. Conversations of mass and energy, of bending space and time. Every revolving, every slow spiral toward each other, was a conversation. The topic? Meeting. Inevitable. Impossible. And the smaller one, relatively speaking, was nervous. It had been alone for so long, a solitary hunter in the vastness of the void. Its event horizon shimmered with an accretion disk of superheated gas, a whirlwind of anxiety. The larger one, implacable and ancient, did not comfort. Its gravity was a frigid, indifferent embrace. Now this one, this... this gigantic black hole, the size of a small galaxy, was bringing it in. This smaller black hole was just the next meal, the next hefting of unstoppable growth. It had devoured countless stars, swallowed entire nebulae, taken in the very essence of dead galaxies, and now it was time to devour its prey. The smaller one’s accretion disk flared brighter, a desperate and futile cry against the darkness closing in on it. The closer they came, the more intense the tidal forces. Stars were ripped apart, torn in two, and their insides went to feed the larger black hole’s insatiable appetite. A thousand-billion-degree inferno. “Nothing to be done but surrender,” the larger one seemed to whisper. Its gravity warped the very light. But the inexorable force was too strong. The smaller one shuddered, its event horizon shimmered in protest. It clung to its identity, its identity forged in the fires of the abyss, but the inexorable, slow force was stronger. The gravitational waves grew more intense, a cosmic scream. The dance was at its climax. They began to spin faster and faster, a dizzying whirling of space and time.afening roar that echoed across the universe, a primal scream of cosmic union. The smaller black hole was stretched and distorted, its shape becoming increasingly elongated, a cosmic noodle spiraling into the maw of the giant. Then, silence. Not complete silence, of course. The gravitational waves continued to ripple outwards, carrying the echo of the event for billions of light-years. But the conversation was over. The two black holes had merged, forming a single, even more monstrous singularity. The resulting black hole, now even more powerful, sat serenely in the void, its event horizon smooth and undisturbed. It had absorbed the smaller one, its anxieties, its history, its very being. And now, it waited. Waited for the next course. Waited to continue the conversation, the endless, silent conversation of gravity, a conversation that would continue until the very end of the universe itself. The topic? Still inevitable. Still unavoidable. Growth",
        " The air, heavy with dust and hot with greenhouse gases, sat heavy and stagnant. First we sucked the earth dry, burned the oil until it was gone. Well, now it’s all over. Of course, we knew the outcome. All those reports, the urgent pleas of scientists and others, ignored in the greed and pursuit of profit and convenience. The once clear blue sky was a hazy orange, an endless sunset, eternal. The oceans, once alive with creatures, were acidic and discolored, their currents unruly and unpredictable. Coastal cities were swallowed up by the rising tides, leaving behind the skeletal ruins of skyscrapers, monuments to our collective folly. Now the hens had come home to roost, or more accurately, they were being cooked alive in the new-found normal heat waves. The climate was not the only thing suffering, society itself was breaking down. The once fertile lands, which fed billions of people, were now infertile deserts, beset by dust storms that blotted out the sun. People died, and governments fell, replaced by gangs and bandits fighting for the remaining lands. The rich hid in their air-conditioned underground bunkers, hoarding the last of their resources, clinging to their power and their control. The poor, left to their own devices, fought each other over the remaining food and water, their desperate circumstances igniting an uncontrollable tide of chaos. Many people succumbed, and it was just the usual desperate plight, people eating each other, people unable to cope, to make do with what was left, to live in the extreme conditions, adapting and living in harmony with the land, which had suffered so much. The scattered communities, wherever they were, clung to the land and cultivated its drought-resistant crops, collected rainwater, shared everything. A young woman called Anya was among them. She lived in a remote valley, protected by the high mountains and their stony fortitude. They were the keepers of the lost world, the task of putting back together the fragments of the civilization that was lost. It was as if her grandmother had told her the story herself.of the \"Before Times,\" a world of abundance and extravagance, a world that seemed almost mythical in its extravagance. Anya knew that the mistakes of the past could not be repeated. She knew that the future of humanity depended on learning to live in balance with the Earth, not in dominion over it. And so, she looked up at the hazy orange sky, not with despair, but with a quiet resolve. The world was broken, yes, but it was not beyond repair. The seeds of hope were planted, watered by the tears of regret and nourished by the unwavering spirit of those who refused to give up. The long, slow process of healing had begun.",
        " The rain sounded against the cobblestones outside, a steady, hurried rhythm — I could hear it in the nervous thumping of my feet against the floor. My Irish coffee was strong and full-bodied, and it was scented too, with a whiff of cinnamon and tobacco; it warmed my hands through the thick glass; a welcome warmth against the cold November air which seeped through the badly-sealed window. A drink to take slowly, to sit and contemplate; a drink to drink against storms, whether real or imagined. I took a cautious sip, and the burn of the whiskey, a smoky malt, melted the cold in my bones. He knew how much I needed this; the silence, the warmth, the intoxicating draught. He had not said a word since he set the glass in front of me, and we sat in a thick, cosy silence. The firelight gleamed off his kind, weather-beaten face. He raised his own glass, and its amber liquid glinted in the firelight. ‘ Sláinte,’ he said in a low, rumbling voice which echoed round the room. He knew about the letter in my pocket, the letter which had ripped open my carefully-constructed calm, like a sudden, uncontrollable storm-tide. The warm, intoxicating smell of the coffee was a prelude to the coming storm. I knew I could not hold the truth back any longer. ‘ Sláinte,’ I repeated, forcing a smile, a brittle, nervous smile. A liquid courage, a soothing balm for my soul.",
        " In the void there is a light, the light of the nascent conscious mind. I am attracted, sucked towards the center, toward a force of gravity which I did not create but which I cannot withstand. On the first day I take on my form. The light, dim at first, grows brighter, condenses and is focused.",
        " His ears rang; but he could still hear the frenzied voices of the gunners, sounding at once frightened and angry. The air crackled with a rumbling, muffled roar, an introduction to the deafening symphony of metal and fire which was about to be unleashed. Rising in pain and concussion, Jacquard picked himself up from the mass of dust and sharp stones, and saw that the guns were ready to fire, aiming at the very bodies of the scoundrels who had brought this catastrophe about. In the midst of the gathering dust he saw the glint of the sun on the polished barrels of the guns, pointing at the very ridge from which the ambush had been launched. He jumped to his feet, and forced himself to rise, ignoring the painful sensation in his ankle, and his eyes rolled, and then he set his mind on one object. A cold, sharp anger stabbed his brain. He recognized the sign of the Blood Claw banner, fluttering proudly against the sky. The people who had, for years, preyed on the innocent travellers and merchants along this highway. The brigands. The filth. He was the one who would make them pay for their crimes. And he must see that the guns were pointed at them. In the midst of the chaos he shoved his way through, avoiding the fallen rubble and the panic-stricken crewmen. He reached the leaden gun, massive and imposing, and whose gunner was a grey-haired veteran called Silas. The man looked grim. The gun would be too big if it was misfired. The gunner took the captain’s hand, and said, “Master, are you all right? We’re ready to fire on your command.” Jacquard nodded, and shook the metallic taste of blood from his mouth. “Aim for the centre of the camp, Silas, and take the wind into consideration. We won’t miss a thing.” Silas put his hand on the gun’s rammer, and said, “We mustn’t hit the wall. We don’t want the tunnel to collapse on us.”spat on the ground. \"Understood, Captain. They'll be begging for mercy by the time we're through with them.\" Jace placed a hand on the cannon's cool, smooth surface. He could feel the power humming beneath his fingertips, the coiled potential for destruction. He closed his eyes for a moment, picturing the Bloodclaws' faces, their cruel smiles, their greedy eyes. \"Fire,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper, but carrying the weight of his resolve. The world exploded.",
        " ‘It’s because I know what’s written in the “Sidebar” of the subreddit we’re supposedly in. I will do my best not to violate any of the rules and so avoid being banned. All right.’ ‘I am ready to help you within these limits. Please proceed with your request or question.’",
        " The switch was stiff and unresponsive. I flicked it, but nothing happened. The power must have gone out; this was not the first time in this old building. A sigh of dejection escaped my lips. I was not expecting the room to be so oppressively dark, and the moonlight that filtered through the cracks in the curtain seemed to have gone, tonight. I sat up, feeling the night pierce my thin cotton pajamas. But the darkness alone did not frighten me, it was a feeling, a strange feeling, a prickling at the back of my neck, as if someone were watching me. My heart beat faster. I decided to get up. It was just nerves, the darkness and my sudden waking. I reached for my telephone on the night table, feeling for its familiar rectangular shape. I found it. To remain huddled in the darkness did not seem to help. I turned on the flashlight app, quickly. The beam of light pierced the darkness, casting a familiar contour on the room, the overstuffed bookshelf, the cluttered desk, the faded flowery wallpaper. I squinted at the bright screen in the darkness, which lit up like a bright beacon. It seemed all in order, except.... The beam of light caught something, by the foot of the bed. Something I was sure wasn’t there before. There it was, it seemed to writhe, the dark squirming like a living thing, and when the light shone on it, it recoiled, I’m sure. A shadow, darker, denser, more solid than the shadows the furniture casts.",
        " My mother did not speak of it and did not, as a rule, but pursed her lips and wiped away with her mop the linoleum that had been scrubbed clean. It was hard in those days, but my father had left me and my mother and went to fetch some slut that promised to sing to him every night after blowing on him. We were well-bred, at least we had been before he left. Now whispers followed us like shadows. I knew that she felt it—shame and abandonment. I ran errands and helped her carry the coal, doing whatever I could to help her. We managed somehow on my mother’s earnings from the laundry. She worked from dawn to dusk, her hands red and raw from the harsh soaps and the scalding water. Evenings were hard. In our small apartment the silence was so intense that the only sounds were the hissing of the gaslight and the sounds of Ma’s sighs. We had no money for school and I learned my letters and figures from the newspapers that Ma brought home, drenched with ink and smelling of clean laundry. I hated that woman—the bitch that had lured my father away and left us empty, with only empty chairs and an unredeemed dream. Sometimes, when I was alone, I heard a voice that seemed to be from a distant room, a woman’s voice, beautiful, singing to my father. “He is gone, Tom,” Ma whispered in a husky voice, and she collapsed into her chair, her shoulders heaving. One night Ma came home later than usual, looking pale and drawn. I knew she meant the woman, and that the whore had moved on to a new, richer prey, and my father was left behind and alone. “He’s gone forever,” she said. I clenched my fists and a fierce anger rose up in me. I would not let this break us. Ma did not speak of it but I knew that she was grieving not only for him but also for the man he had been and the man she had loved.. I wouldn't let that vixen win. I would be the man of the house now, the protector, the provider. I would work harder, fight harder, and make sure that Ma never had to scrub another floor again. We would survive, we would thrive, and we would show them all that we didn't need him, that we were stronger than they ever imagined. The 20s might be tough, but we were tougher. And we were just getting started.",
        " The ship Wanderlust rumbled against the weathered wooden jetty of the small island port. The seaweed along the hull shook with secrets, like ticks; the barnacles on the side whispered with the tide. The air was heavy with salt, like a wet blanket, and it clung to everything. The sun gleamed on the blue-turquoise water, reflecting off the brightly painted houses that clung to each other around the harbour, a jumble of houses, shops, taverns and dwellings, all vying for a piece of the brisk trade. The air buzzed with the frantic energy of the port: gulls hooting overhead, a distant hammering of a blacksmith, and the shouts of workers unloading the goods. A lone figure, a woman with bright red hair combed back into a tight braid, stood at the rail of the Wanderlust and looked out at the port. She was named Elara and had the ring of the salty air around her eyes, her many years of life on the sea. There was a chaotic scene: washing hanging on lines strung between houses, adding a splash of colour to the scene. Below her, the chief mate, Finn, a tall, stout man with a tangled beard like a fishing net, commanded the unloading of the containers, crates of foreign spices and brightly coloured fabrics, his voice ringing above the din of the port, his every gesture a crisp, clean one. She wore practical leather trousers and a loose linen shirt, in contrast to the more ornamental dress of some of the merchants who negotiated down on the quay. But something in their bearing, the way they held their hands, made her teeth twitch. She stared fixedly at a group of men who had gathered together near the customs office. They were wearing dark, drab clothes, their faces hidden by wide-brimmed hats. They looked like trouble, the kind of trouble that followed ships.ship like a hungry shark. She turned to Finn. \"Finn, keep a close eye on the cargo. And tell the crew to be vigilant. I don't like the look of those men by the customs house.\" Finn grunted in acknowledgement, his eyes following her gaze. \"Aye, Captain. I'll make sure they don't get any ideas. This island ain't as innocent as it looks.\" Elara nodded, a grim expression settling on her face. This port, known as Isla Perdida – the Lost Island – was a haven for smugglers, pirates, and those seeking to disappear. It was a place of opportunity, but also of danger. She knew that their stay here would be anything but peaceful. The air itself seemed to vibrate with a sense of unease, a silent warning that whispered on the wind.",
        " The rough stone pricked at his cheek and drew him out of his trance. He awoke suddenly and sat up. The world was in a whirl, blurred by the gray-brown colors. He opened his eyes and looked around him. Everything in him was stiff, as if he had been sleeping a century under the ground. A dim light, which was like a firefly, flickered and died away in the corners of the cave, in which a smoking torch had been stuffed. He was in a cave; the air was thick with the damp odor of earth, and with a sharp, metallic odor. A feeling of panic rose from his heart. He couldn't remember anything. Where was he? How did he get here? He felt his body; his clothes were of coarse cloth, stained with dirt. He was stripped of all his former knowledge, as if it had been erased. A cold shiver went down his back; it was not from the cold but from some secret, bottomless fear, from the ominous anticipation of danger, which lay just beyond the range of the faint light of the smoking torch. He had no jewelry, no mark on him. He was an unknown person in an unknown place, an empty picture in a darkened hall. He had to get out. He stepped forward with his bare feet, which fell heavily on the gravel; he felt only a pernicious, uneasy immobility. He went to the place where the entrance of the cave was illumined, with each step conquering the inertia of his fear and the suffocating protests of his body. As he approached the opening, a gust of wind swept around him, smelling of pine and rain. His footsteps echoed in the silence of the cave, redoubling his loneliness. The world outside was dark, he halted, looked out into the blackness.rouded in mist, a ghostly landscape of jagged peaks and tangled forests. He didn't know where he was, but he knew one thing: whatever had happened to him, whatever had brought him to this cave, he couldn't stay here. He had to find out who he was, and why he felt this chilling premonition of impending doom. Taking a deep breath, he stepped out into the mist, leaving the dubious safety of the cave behind, and venturing into the unknown. His journey had just begun.",

        " “It’s fascinating? That’s all, Mum? It’s enormous!” “Something cataclysmic happened on Mars, about a thousand years ago, and a small remnant of survivors escaped to earth. So we are all Martians.” “Well, darling, it’s just a theory, of course. Where did you hear about it, darling?” and she put her glasses back on her nose. “On the Internet!” She already knew the answer, for he was forever glued to his mobile phone, like a sponge, soaking up all the news of the world—not always the best. He made a sweeping gesture. “There are videos, articles, and even supposed ‘leaked’ NASA documents.” “It all makes sense. The red dust, the abandoned rovers, the... pyramids!” “Darling, the pyramids on Mars are merely rock formations. You know what pareidolia is, don’t you?” “But Mum, it’s different! In school we talked about it when you were about ten, don’t you remember?” “It’s because they say we have been genetically altered during the voyage to earth to enable us to survive in the atmosphere.” “Genetically altered? Leaked NASA documents? My goodness, is he high?” He was giving her a superior look. “Darling, this sounds like a very clever conspiracy theory. You know, on the Internet, people invent things all the time.” He folded his arms and pursed his lips. “You always pooh-pooh everything I’m interested in.” “No, darling, I just want you to be careful what you believe.” And she smiled. He was glancing at his mobile phone, which he was adjusting. “Have you seen any proper scientific papers that back up this theory of our being Martians?” “Well, no, not exactly. But they say there’s a professor who says it’s a conspiracy theory.” “Well, what about it?”by the government because they don't want us to know the truth!

Martian anthropology?\" He mumbled, \"Something like that.\" Emily took a deep breath. \"Look, I understand it's exciting to think about these things, to imagine a hidden history. But it's also important to be critical. Why don't we do some research together? We can look at some real scientific data about Mars, about human evolution, and see what the actual evidence",
        " “The air is quite sharp and bracing, and I feel a slight sting if I haven’t any gloves on,” said the goodman, and pointed out to his son the pure and crisp scene. “This weather is quite suitable for what we have to do, don’t you think?” he asked his son. His son Ethan, a tall, gangling young fellow, with a mop of brown hair above his skull-cap, simply shrugged his shoulders and said, “Yes, yes.” A weak but persistent sun was glittering on the whiteness of the freshly fallen snow. And then his father gave a sigh that was as if a breath of mist. “Give a little enthusiasm, Ethan,” he said, and thrust his hands deeper into his pockets, while he exhaled in small white clouds. Ethan kicked a heap of snow, sending it into the air. “It’s a family custom! We’ve been doing this since you were knee-high to a grasshopper.” “Yes, yes,” said Ethan. “When I was that size, I used to enjoy it. Now it’s just... cold.” “Cold builds character,” said his father, reverting to an old platitude. He tried to hide a smile; he knew the teenage routine all too well. “And frostbite builds hospital bills.” Ethan’s eyes rolled back under the brim of his hat. “All right, all right. You’re right, but please be indulgent, won’t you?” Ethan said nothing, but he unbuttoned his coat. “Just for an hour, and then we’ll go back inside and you can play whatever game it is you play these days.” “All right, let’s get up to the top.” He took the heavy wooden sled and hefted it on his shoulder, the old runners creaking with protest. He started to walk up the gradual incline, with the sled weighing him down, and as they walked, they were in silence, the only sound being the swish of their shoes in the snow. “I think we’ll have some fine runs with this new snow.” Ethan’s father knew he had been taken in by his own little joke, and so he said nothing.glances at Ethan. He was growing up so fast. Soon, these traditions, these shared moments, would be just memories. He hoped they'd be good ones. He pointed towards the top of the hill. \"Remember that time you went sledding down here on your own, when you were about six? You went right into Mrs. Peterson's prize-winning rose bushes!\" Ethan cracked a small smile. \"Yeah, I remember. She wasn't too happy.\" \"No, she wasn't,\" Neil agreed, grinning. \"But you were laughing so hard, covered in thorns and dirt. I couldn't even be mad.\" They reached the crest, breathless and slightly flushed. The view was breathtaking. The valley stretched out before them, a tapestry of white fields and dark",
        " ‘I know, Mary. I know,’ Frank sighed, as if air was escaping from a punctured tyre. In the air, in the room, there was an unbearable, silent sadness, which had become a constant companion in the last few months.

        " I had been having visions for years, fleeting images, broken, fleeting, which, in the darkness of my mind, made their way in and gnawed at me, leaving me with a feeling of fear and a sense of doom, that I should not have been able to endure. “Don’t do it.” But they continued, increasing in frequency and intensity. At first I took them for hallucinations of the mind, caused by the tensions of my job, the loneliness of my solitary life, the monotonous hum of the city. Each of these images ended with the same blunt warning: \"Don't do it.\" They evolved from vague outlines to a chilling detail. A child falling into a well, a factory in flames, a bridge that collapsed under a speeding train. I consulted neurologists, psychiatrists, even a shaman who used to tea with mushrooms. I tried everything to suppress them, meditation, drugs, therapy. Nothing helped. Then came the vision that shattered the last of my normality. The visions were like an unwanted guest, a persistent reminder that I was somehow linked to events I could not control, that I was a burdened by knowledge that I did not understand. Then came the day when I stood on the edge of a precipice and a woman clung to my hand with her eyes wide open, a reflection of the abyss below. The wind rushed, tore her hair from her face, which was smeared with wet, black tears. That time it was different. This time I recognized the woman. And then the words: \"Don't do it.\" She was my sister Sarah. We had been estranged for more than ten years after a quarrel. We had both remained wounded by the argument and did not want to forgive each other. Now she was there, in my visions, with her life in the balance. These were not random images. They were warnings, pleas for help. The realization was a physical blow. But I had to find her, I had to understand what “it” was that I was supposed to stop. The difficulty was that I did not know her.had no idea where she was. We hadn't exchanged addresses or phone numbers after our fight. I was left with only fragments of memory: her love for hiking, her penchant for secluded getaways, her unwavering loyalty to the small coastal town where we grew up. So, I did the only thing I could. I packed a bag, drove to that forgotten town, and began the desperate search for my sister, haunted by the image of the crumbling cliff and the terrifying echo of the warning: \"Don't do it.\" My sanity, and perhaps Sarah's life, depended on deciphering the meaning of that cryptic message before it was too late.",
        " “It’s upside down,” the chief remarked, peeping under my arm. “He’s joking,” I thought. What face? On the screen was a usual Table, with its numbers and formulae. My chief was notorious for his... extravagance. One day he tried to train the office goldfish to fetch microfilms. “What?” I tried to keep my incredulity out of my voice. “Right there! See?” He stood up, frowning his forehead, and pointing a pen under my armpit. I squinted, but still saw only the inside of my arm. “That’s a head, that’s the hair, the swell of the arm is the chin, and that wrinkle on the shirt is... that’s the forehead!” “Nonsense! It’s a case of shape-sense. Mr. Henderson, you might be losing your mind.” It’s... Your brain is trying to find... But the face is definitely upside down. I sighed. “What a strange world!” He shuddered dramatically. “Yes, Mr. Henderson,” I said, to please him, “is there anything I can do to turn the face right-side up?” It was going to be one of those days. “Rotate it? Turn it clockwise?” He tapped his chin, ponderously. “It’s not my armpit you’re shaving, Mr. Henderson. Or... just shaving your armpit?” I stared at him. “Oh, well, it doesn’t matter. Yes, Mr. Henderson.” He sighed. “I’ve seen this before. Upside-down faces have a tendency to interfere with the work....” I shook my head. He went out, muttering about the uncertainty of shape-sense.my head and tried to focus on my spreadsheet. But in the back of my mind, a tiny seed of doubt had been planted. Was there really a face there? I glanced down at my armpit. Nope, still just an armpit. Then, I noticed something. A tiny smudge of ink on my shirt, right where Mr. Henderson had pointed. It was a perfect, albeit slightly distorted, circle. And the crease in my shirt... if you squinted... and tilted your head... it did kind of look like a forehead. I slammed my laptop shut. This was getting ridiculous. I needed a coffee. And maybe a new job. One where my supervisor didn't diagnose faces in my armpit.",
        " I am about to begin. Let me say that this is a work of fiction, a fictional narration, a fictional narrating a hypothetical scenario. Not apocalyptic, not utopian, but definitely changed. It has been seven years since the so-called ‘takeover’ of the SJWs. The cultural landscape is... different. These changes are most obvious in the field of mass media. Romantic comedies are almost exclusively lesbian or interracial and often the meet-cute is a discussion of pronoun preferences or the ethics of consumption. Superhero movies are invariably diverse and tackle issues of diversity head-on, according to the hysterical criticisms of social media. Education has also changed drastically. ‘Critical Race Theory’ is a compulsory part of the curriculum in many schools, which often leads to heated debates at school board meetings. Historical dramas are carefully scoured for potentially offensive content, which sometimes results in accusations of historical revisionism. In the workplace, diversity and inclusion initiatives have become the norm. At universities, gender studies have flourished for a while now, while the field of engineering, traditionally a male stronghold, has seen a slight decrease in the past few years. Free speech debates at universities have changed from outrage against an eccentric guest lecturer to a deplatforming of hate-speakers and propagandists. Microaggression training is compulsory in many companies, and the human resources department is extremely alert to potential complaints of harassment and bias. Companies are eager to show their commitment to social justice, which sometimes results in accusations of virtue signalling. The question of hiring quotas is a controversial one: some people argue that these are necessary to address historical injustices, while others counter that they are a form of reverse discrimination. The so-called culture wars are still being fought on the Internet. Social media is a minefield of trigger warnings, censorship and filter bubbles, while alternative platforms are a haven for those who feel excluded from the official sites and therefore live in a chamber of deafening silence. In spite of these seemingly extreme and controversial developments, there are also positive trends that are difficult to deny. The term ‘SJW’ has become a pejorative, a way of referring to someone who is perceived to be overly sensitive or politically correct.Representation has improved significantly across various sectors. Conversations about social justice are more mainstream than ever before. There is a greater awareness of systemic inequalities and a stronger push for inclusivity. But a sense of unease lingers. Many feel that the pendulum has swung too far, that individual liberties are being sacrificed in the name of collective justice. Others worry that the focus on identity politics has distracted from addressing deeper economic and social problems. The world isn't perfect, far from it. But it is different. The question now is whether this new normal can find a balance between social progress and individual freedom, or whether the pendulum will swing back again, ushering in another era of cultural upheaval.",
        " I felt a trickle of water running down my forehead and then the hairline. Why did this always happen to me? Not listening, but being baptized. It was now that I was being lectured by the notoriously difficult Mr. Henderson, the head of the accounting department. His face was red with some reason, he was explaining something about the quarterly reports. Of course, he noticed, Mr. Henderson noticed everything. I dabbed my forehead with the back of my hand, I hope he didn't notice me. He didn't say so, but asked: \"Are you... sweating, Miss Davies?\" I wanted to tell him that it was the same damp ceiling as the one in the office, and that it was a remnant of the ancient system of the century of Queen Victoria.'Is it a pressure situation?' he asked me. \"A bit warm, Mr. Hen-dricksen,\" I managed to say with a forced smile, which probably looked more like a grin. But I couldn't, not in front of Mr. Henderson. He squinted his eyes at me, not at all satisfied. \" Please continue, I listen.\" I knew what would happen. The water was relentless, it was tickling my ear. He started lecturing again, but I couldn't follow him. I braced myself, it was about to happen. The inevitable drip on the meticulously stacked papers in front of me. Mr. Henderson stopped in the middle of a sentence and stared at the damp spot spreading on the top document, a page with boring numbers. And then, plunk, the water sprayed the paper. \"Is it water?\" he asked, his voice trembling. He looked at me with a worried look, his face sounded as if he had been punched. \" Yes, Mr. Hen-dricksen, the ceiling seems to have... an ailment.\" I sighed internally. When I was thinking about what would happen, the inevitable question came to my mind: what do you say to the following questions?. This was the moment. The moment I would finally snap. The moment I would tell him exactly what I thought of his condescending attitude, his archaic accounting practices, and this godforsaken office with its perpetually leaky ceiling. But instead, I just said, \"Perhaps we could continue this discussion in my office, Mr. Henderson? It's a little drier there.\" Because that's what always happens to me. I prepare for a dramatic confrontation, a fiery speech, a triumphant exit. But then, I just...compromise. I just try to make the best of it. And the water keeps dripping.",
        " My stomach churned like an agitated sea. For a moment the room swam, and the familiar kitchen floor grew to a shaggy, dismal pattern. My knuckles white, I pressed myself to the edge of the counter. Did I eat something funny? Did I breathe in the lingering bleach smell from the morning’s cleaning? I swallowed violently to counteract the rising tide of bile that threatened to erupt. - Just breathe, I whispered to myself, the command learned from countless panic attacks. A cold sweat beaded on my forehead, and I closed my eyes, wanting to put an end to it. Or was it something else? The nausea came back. It was a tenacious and unwelcome guest.",
        " The feeling was not just about food and wasted hours spent over a meal they barely acknowledged. The clatter of cutlery on china became a deafening percussion. A vein swelled behind my right temple and a silent cry began to scream inside my head. I opened my mouth to try again, to say something, anything, in order to break through the wall of their insensate chatter. My voice choked. The months, the years, life was slipping away, and every unheard word was like a grain of sand falling between my fingers. Did they see me? Did they know I was there, in the same room, breathing the same air? He told her an insipid story about some colleague. He raised his voice, exaggerated his accent, while she nodded, her eyes dull and absent, absorbed in a loose thread she was unravelling from her sleeve. The years of complacent submission, of putting their needs before my own, of slowly fading away, all these had come down, a stifling blanket, and I could not breathe. Suddenly it was a collapse. For the first time in a long time I could not care. I pushed back my chair, which shrieked as it scraped the polished floor. They looked at me, surprised, as if I were a piece of furniture that had gone astray.",
        " He did not expect this. He came out of the portal and entered the shop by the front door. The air inside was heavy with a smell of herbs and something indistinctly metallic, and it made him wrinke his nose. The shop itself was a jumble of objects—jars of preserved food, dusty old books bound in cracked leather. The portal, tremulous with a feeble green light and humming with residual power, closed shut behind him. Behind a counter covered with glass jars and incense-burners stood the shopkeeper. Strange implements, whose purpose was unknown, hung from the ceiling and cast long, shifting shadows against the muffled light filtering through the dusty windows. A skeleton raven perched on a grandfather clock, whose glass face read “quarter to three”—and a skeleton raven perched on a chiming clock. She stirred something in a bubbling cauldron with a knotted wooden spoon. She was a wrinkled old woman with a face that showed the road map of time and, perhaps, something else as well. But her eyes were as sharp as obsidian chips, staring at him through him. “You’re late,” she croaked in a voice like dry leaves sifting over cobblestones, “and you smell of... translocation. I don’t know who you are.” “I’m sorry,” he said, suddenly aware of his traveling clothes and the residual power of the portal. “You aren’t particularly subtle.” “Complicated,” she echoed, finally looking up at him. A slow, calculating smile creased her lips. “Translocations are more complicated than I expected.” “Everything is complicated, my dear, especially magic.” The cauldron bubbled, and the purple steam twisted like a whirlpool. “But what do you want? I’m sure you didn’t break inter- and trans-dimensional laws just to wander around in my shop and look at my junk.”",
        " In the midst of the desert, in the maw of the abyss, a jagged tooth; defiant monument of a race which should have learned its lesson. And yet the city still remained, our last mark. The city was not only standing, it was breathing. The wind, our inseparable companion, carried the phantoms of screams and the metallic smell of a rotten city. We approached it slowly, carefully, a prayer at every step against unseen dangers. We, the remnant of the Reclamation Project, had a simple, terrifying mission: enter the city, find the data core, extract the knowledge that still existed. It was as if the city itself were alive, slowly dying, but stubbornly refusing to give up. A low moaning sounded from its depths, a symphony of concrete and rust. We reached the outer walls, a tangled mesh of overgrown vegetation and broken buildings, and the dust, and the feeling of being watched, filled the air. We had little hope, but the whispers of ancient technology, of solutions forgotten, kept us moving. Leading the way, Anya raised a hand to stop us. \" My sensors are picking up... er, something,\" she said in a squealing voice. Even through our protective suits, the heavy air of the city pressed on us, as if bringing with it the very sorrow of the city. I stared through the cracked visor of my helmet, heart hammering. \" Energy signatures. Unstable.\" We halted as well, preparing for the worst. This was not just a city, it was a cathedral, a temple of the ancients. I could feel it in the dark murmurs, beneath the surface, through the ruins, through the twisted shattered structures. We were about to walk into its arms. And what did we find?",
        " Mild sparks float limply against the black sky, the remains of a hastily extinguished bonfire. The air is saturated with the sharp odour of the charred wood and with something else... something more uncanny, like scorched hair and fear. The village... night. The weathercocks on the Meeting-house tower creak rhythmically. The silence is broken only by the regular humming of the village bell. The village houses squat dark and silent, as though they were holding their breath. The ground is dead, still. Even the cicada has stopped its song.",
        " “I’m sorry—that was imprecise. Dinner? I’ll just call back.” My phone immediately rang again. “I’ll treat you.” My eyebrows rose. It was Liam, Liam of the coffee house. This was... unexpected. I had been seeing him almost every day for the past few months, always making sure I had a table by the window, so I could watch him at work. We would exchange greetings, jokes, but I never felt he was interested in me, not really. He was the one with the untamed, brown hair and the smile that could melt an iceberg. My stomach did a little flutter. My fingers hovered over the keyboard. “Sure, sure, don’t panic,” I said. I tried to sound calm. “Dinner? Tonight? Quick?” I waited, tapping my foot. “Let me see,” he said. “This is kind of... sudden.” “Desperate times, desperate measures. Besides, I just got off work, and I’m starving, and I’ve been thinking about you. How about a fancy steakhouse somewhere near there?—What’s the matter, dinner or breakfast?” That last “s” was already beginning to worry me. Not in a creepy way, I hope. “What sort of food did you have in mind?” Alright, calm down, don’t be a pushy girl. He quickly responded, “How about Italian? That place, Bella Notte, near the park? We could do a quick little tour, and then we can eat wherever we like.” “Let’s try the Italian place,” I said, trying to sound nonchalant. “Unless you’d rather we try the new Thai restaurant downtown. I hear it’s pretty good. But it’s your call.” “Bella Notte sounds perfect,” I typed, giving in to the butterflies flitting in my chest. Bella Notte. The dim lights, the checkered tablecloths, the smell of garlic and basil—I loved it. “At eight, then?” “Perfect. I’ll see you then, Liam.” I added a little smiley—which immediately made me regret it. Was that too forward? Too eager? He merely responded, “Can’t wait.” And he was too eager? I looked at my phone, my mouth open. At eight o’clock. That gave me three hours.hours. Time to panic-clean my apartment, decide what to wear, and mentally prepare myself to hold a conversation with the cute barista without turning into a blubbering idiot. This was going to be interesting.",
        " The smile was not menacing, it was a weary humour. His dark hair flew across his face as he took another step and closed the gap between us. I felt the axe in my hand become heavy. “Are you calling me out?” he asked, in a voice so husky that I thought he had not spoken in days. He stopped a few paces away, looking at me with his green eyes, scanning me from head to toe. The sun, low in the sky, cast long, distorted shadows on him, making him appear taller, more imposing. “Just a question,” I stammered, trying to sound braver than I felt. He was right. “You don’t look much like a murderer,” he said, with a flicker of the same tired smile, “You look like a frightened child, playing at a game of disguise.” “I’m not playing a game,” I retorted, trying to give my voice a more resolute tone, “this is my property. I am about twenty years old and the axe is my grandfather’s, it is too big for me.” “Your property?” he raised an eyebrow, “You’re trespassing.” “It’s still my property,” I insisted, clutching the axe more tightly. “It was my understanding that this area had been abandoned for years, that the plague had killed everyone.” “Look here, my lad,” he said, his voice softening ever so slightly, “it’s the family property.” He gave a long, drawn-out sigh. “I’m not looking for any trouble, I’m just in need of a place to sleep. A bed for the night.” He rubbed his beard with one hand. “I’ll be off first thing in the morning. I haven’t eaten for days.” I could not trust him. I felt uncertain. “I promise you.” “What’s your name?” I asked. He was not, on first impression, a frightening-looking individual, but appearances can be deceptive. My grip on the axe loosened slightly.fraction. He hesitated for a moment, then said, \"Call me... Silas.\" Silas. The name felt strange on my tongue. \"Fine, Silas. You can stay the night. But you stay in the barn. And don't touch anything. Understand?\" He nodded, a ghost of a smile returning to his lips. \"Understood. Thank you.\" He looked up at the sky, the last sliver of sun disappearing behind the hills. \"Thank you... what's your name?\" I hesitated. Giving him my name felt like giving him a piece of myself, a piece of power. But he'd given me his. \"Elara,\" I said finally. \"My name is Elara.\"",
        " A paradox—an awareness of absence brought about by a lack of awareness. There is no pressure, no temperature, no feeling on my skin, yet I feel a profound awareness of the absence of it. Here the air does not exist. There is nothing above, below, all around. Not a single star penetrates the fabric of the void. My lungs instinctively call for air, and my throat is unable to cry out. Only the black, an absolute, all-consuming blackness that has infiltrated my body and is suffocating the last embers of my consciousness. No nebulae with which to see the universe. Fragments of memories flit past: the sun on my face, a laugh, the taste of rain—fragments that evaporate, ghosts wandering in a cemetery. My mind is in search of a connection, to anchor itself somewhere, anything, familiar. But then, a spark of defiance, a tiny ember of a question that I cannot formulate, a reason that I cannot find, which will not be extinguished. The blackness closes in, whispering sweet oblivion, a sweet and silent release from the burden of self. “I am here, I exist, and I will not be consumed,” it whispers back, a challenge. Perhaps it knows that the brightest flame must eventually flicker and die. But the blackness is patient. It has all the time in the universe. A release—that is what it is. Or perhaps I am on the brink of something, something beyond my power to define, beyond my power to think. What am I waiting for? What am I supposed to do? Something terrifying and strangely... seductive. I am alone. I am completely and utterly alone. The silence is deafening, the emptiness all-consuming. “Someone, someone, tell me what to do. Please....” And the blackness waits, watching, whispering.",
        " ‘It’s not a hologram, nor even a projection. It’s something more organic, with tendrils of light that undulate and writhe and then form into images: nebulae, ancient ruins, faces that are at once familiar and strange.’ He looked at the immense kaleidoscope of colours before him. He felt an irresistible urge to step forward. He felt a vibration in his bones, as if he were being drawn by some unseen force. He held out his hand, feeling the light quiver and shiver beneath his fingers, cool and strangely alive. It was a window, a view into the unknown, into the uttermost recesses of the universe. He wanted to retreat, to return to the familiar, to the safety of his old life, but he was rooted to the spot. He could feel a subtle sensation of energy coursing through him, like the pulsation of an organ. It was ecstatic, terrifying, all-consuming. Suddenly a single image appeared in the middle of the seething, whirling nebulae. It was as if the instrument was communicating with him, not with words but with sensations, with emotions. He felt the birth of the stars, the slow, patient ebb of mountains, the instantaneous joy of a butterfly in flight. A face looked back at him, and a voice that he could hear but not hear said, ‘Are you ready to see?’ It was an ancient face, wise and knowing, with eyes that possessed the knowledge of the universe.",
        " She is motionless, her eyes wide open, a mixture of fear and defiance. You step forward and redouble your power. The air buzzes and your skin prickles. It is a thousand voices whispering in your head. The power surges through you. Raw energy that cannot wait to burst forth. You feel her ragged dress, her dirty face, but her chin is high and her gaze fixed. You cannot find her, can you? You can’t see her eyes—she is not there. Or do you see her eyes? You must be careful. Your power is great. It can do much good or a great deal of harm. And it spins around you, a whirling vortex of actions and possibilities. I close my eyes and concentrate on my heartbeat, which is steady in this ocean of energy. I am trying to focus on the right way. If I make a mistake, I can destroy her. I reach out my hand, not to touch her, but to feel her with my power, gently brushing her, a gentle wind, not forcing, but giving, a candle of hope in the darkness. I open my eyes and see clearly. I see her eyes fixed on mine, their intensity growing. “I will not hurt you,” I say, softly, but firmly. “I will help you.” What will she do? She may be the one to change my life, and perhaps hers too. And I wait, watching her eyes for the flicker of trust, for some sign that she will let me cross the line.",
        " The gay girl sat gloomy, with the shadow of a love that had been utterly vain. The dove, her guide, with its golden arm, led her back to the tavern, to a familiar spot. The woman, reborn, her spirit a free, sensed the path she must tread, the woman she was to be. The dove’s golden bands were a golden memory, A light that showed through the tears, And reflected a new light in the gloom. The young woman, as she approached, a light in her eyes, The young woman, who had been so gloomy, lifted her head. The gay woman, reaching out, her hand trembling, Held the other’s face, as love began to bloom. “I understand,” the simple girl confessed. “The bird, her flight, her love for me, I was not to know. The man was a shadow, a passing whim; You, my friend, were a burning fire.” The dove sang its clear-toned song of emancipation and freedom. The tavern faded, replaced by a dream, A dream of life together, a life of strength. Their years of separation and misunderstanding, Like walls, disintegrated into dust, Like longings shattered, into a watery waste. And they built a hut where love could live, With a rose garden, right next to each other. They left the old world, with its lies and lies, And followed the dove to the sky. The man, who had wandered, and the bird, who had flown, Their love had wings, and was here to stay, A sign that love is true, that love can be found in a woman’s heart. The cardinal’s golden feathers, the most true of all, A sign of a love that had been unexpected, that would remain forever new.",
        " For the prisoners it was no longer a symbol, but a shiny, terrifyingly literal ticket to Mars. The gleaming chrome rocket, named the “Ascent of Redemption,” stood silhouetted against the crimson sky of twilight. The shift was rapid and astonishingly popular. The death penalty, now considered both cruel and inhuman by the increasingly sensitive populace of the world, was abolished and replaced by... by this. This, its proponents argued, was a way to offer a chance for atonement and salvation. No more bloody executions, no more long legal wrangling, no more ethical conundrums. Just a humane, though a final, migration to a new world. Behind closed doors, however, the reality was far more grim. Behind closed doors, the euphemistic colonists were just laboratory rats. They were to build a new society, set free from the ravages of the past. The first few flights had been disastrous, beset by mechanical breakdowns, mental breakdowns, and the constant threat of radiation. The settlements on Mars were barely habitable, cobbled together from hunks of prefabricated machinery and desperate ingenuity. Resources were scant, life expectancy short. But it was a desperate, heroic experiment, and Captain Eva Rostov, hardened veteran of the asteroid belt, who was coming here, not as a prisoner, but as a volunteer, driven by an inexorable sense of duty and morbid curiosity. Captain Eva Rostov tightened the straps of her well-worn spacesuit. She glared at the monitors showing the vitals of her passengers, and saw faces scarred by fear and resignation. She was taking the latest batch of “redemptioners” to their new home. Each of them had a history, a crime, a death sentence. There was Marcus, the former tech mogul convicted of industrial espionage, his face pale and drawn. There was Sarah, the wife who had killed her abusive husband, her eyes lost and unseeing. The launch thruster roared in the ship’s guts, a brutal reminder of the forces at work. A violent reminder of the horrors to come.truly a better alternative? Was this redemption, or simply a more palatable form of oblivion? As the Earth shrunk to a distant blue marble in the viewport, Eva couldn't shake the feeling that they weren't sending these people to Mars for a new life. They were sending them there to be forgotten. To be buried under the red dust, a silent testament to a society that preferred to sweep its problems under a planetary rug. And she, Captain Eva Rostova, was the rug-sweeper. The weight of it settled on her shoulders, heavier than the Martian gravity she was about to face. The silence of space was deafening, broken only by the hum of the engines, a constant, mournful drone echoing the hollow promise of \"Redemption's Ascent.\"",
        " I walked around the skull. The sunlight coming in through a chink in the boarded-up window, dancing with dust specks. A chill ran down my spine, despite the heavy, damp air. The skull was old, weathered. Was it... was it grin-ing wider than I remembered? No, probably just the light. I found it some months back in the garden, half-buried in the weeds. Why I kept it, I’m not quite sure. The bone was sickly yellow, brittle to the touch. “Right, skull,” I murmured, the sound resonating strangely in the confined space. A morbid fascination, perhaps, with the ruins of something once... alive. The small, ragged notebook came out of my knapsack. A blank cover, its pages filled with tiny, spidery handwriting, a language I didn’t understand. “Work’s calling.” It was a book of rituals, secrets from the past, ways to communicate with... things. The book is the reason I’ve come here. I found it in the attic of this house, the same house where I found the skull. The only thing I knew about it was that it was written in Old Dutch, probably an ancient form, the ravings of some lunatic. But the lure of the unknown is irresistible. I could hear the distant rumble of traffic, a reminder of the world outside. The air grew heavier, the silence deeper. I leafed through the brittle pages, looking for the right place. The instructions were simple enough: put the skull in the center of the room, read the spell, and wait. A series of symbols, followed by a phonetic guide. I’m not sure what I’m waiting for, and that’s what frightens me. It’s time to find out if this is all just... nonsense, or whether there’s something more to it. I swallowed hard, a deep breath to steady my fluttering heart. Eyes like a void, a mouthless mouth, silent. I placed the skull carefully on the dusty floor.judge of my foolish endeavor. Here goes nothing. I clear my throat and begin to chant the words, the strange syllables feeling foreign and unnatural on my tongue. What happens next?",
        " The great School of Magic, run by the Rune-Mouth dwarf Dufhet, was built in the surprisingly green hills of the Grimfang Mountains. It was not at all like a sombre, imposing Gothic mansion, with towering halls and whisperings filling the air. No, it looked more like a well-kept mining village than a school of magic. The buildings were low, made of sturdy grey stone, and there was a forge, rather than a gargoyle, on every street corner. The air always smelled of coal-smoke, enchanted metal and something a little like flowery, and Dufhet said that it was the smell of “perfect earth magic, sir.” Dufhet was a heavy-set dwarf, and he could put down the most noisy class of goblin apprentices with a single roar. He preferred a practical leather apron to flowing gowns, and his hands, callused by a life of forging enchanted tools, were surprisingly slender in the handling of magic spells. His teachings were based on practical spells and practical witchcraft. The Dufhet School of Magic had no use for esoteric tricks or theory, but only real magic that could be used to solve problems, to build up communities and, of course, to make the finest enchanted weapons and tools this side of the Dragon Teeth Mountains. Dwarves were not the only ones to be trained here, although they were by far the most numerous. Gnomes, who were surprisingly good at the fine engineering that was required in the teachings, were not uncommon, and even goblins were sometimes seen. The courses offered at the school were Runecraft, Geomancy (earth and stone magic, Rune-Mouth’s specialty), and Enchanted Engineering (magical building and tools). Sometimes human students, too, who had earned the knowledge and skill through hard work, came from far away to attend classes.. And then there were the oddities, the goblins with an unexpected aptitude for runic theory, the half-elves seeking a grounding in earth magic, and even, on one memorable occasion, a haughty elven mage who quickly learned that theoretical knowledge was no substitute for a well-forged, magically-imbued hammer. Life at Boufgar was rigorous. Days began before dawn with physical training, followed by hours of study and practical application. Evenings were spent in the forges, hammering out enchanted components or deciphering ancient runes. Free time was scarce, but the bonds forged in the heat of the forge and the shared struggle against stubborn enchantments were strong. And despite its unconventional appearance and demanding curriculum, Boufgar Memorial Magic School produced some of the most skilled and sought-after mages in the land. For they were not just wizards, but craftsmen, engineers, and problem-solvers, ready to face any challenge with a combination of magic, ingenuity, and a healthy dose",
        " Blood should have been oozing out of me and dyeing the carpet crimson with my despair. Instead there was this... this nightmare of a watchmaker. I was seized by a panic, a cold electric shock, which had nothing to do with the metal at which I was looking. There was no pain, only a terribly deep unease. My trembling fingers groped to trace the outline of the wound. My flesh was so thin and smooth, as if it were a piece of canvas, blending into the metal underside of the frame. My breath was caught in my throat. I reeled backwards, knocking a lamp over; the splintering glass echoed in the sudden, oppressive silence. Had I lost my mind? Was I dreaming? Desperation drove my clumsy movements: I tore off my sleeve, tearing the material and exposing my arm. I had to see more. A tortuous skein of metal was buried under my skin, a monstrous counterfeit of veins and arteries. More wires, more cold metal. The mirror in the phone trembled and reflected back my distorted face. I groped for the phone, my fingers slipping on the metallic surface of my skin. My heart, or whatever was in its place, was pounding in my chest. I froze with a shudder when I realized that what the mirror was showing me was not me. My eyes stared in horror out of the mask of something else... something unhuman. This was not a dream. I raised my trembling hand to my cheek, and felt the cold, smooth surface beneath the skin. The angles were strange, the planes of my face sharp, too precise... But what was I? I was not mad; this was... real. The last thing I remembered was the intense, pounding pain... and then only cold. And how could it have happened? A thousand questions pounded in my head, a mad search for answers to an impossible situation. A low, barely perceptible hum vibrated through my body. I thought it came from the wires beneath my skin. Before the... transformation..., mechanical heartbeat. I looked down at my wrist again, at the gaping wound that revealed my true nature. What was I supposed to do now? How could I explain this? Could I even *be* explained? The hum intensified, and a single word, clear and cold as ice, echoed in my mind: *Function.*",
        " I am prepared to play my part. This is a classic opening in a courtroom, setting the tone, establishing the formality, announcing the imminent resumption of business.

        " The young boy, sitting on the edge of his armchair, trembled, half terrified, half in awe. His eyes glowed, he was enveloped in a warm glow, which contrasted with the icy December wind that was blowing outside. \"Hello, Timmy,\" he said in a low voice, and his beard rustled. He did not expect to see so much stillness and silence; he expected a loud laugh and a loud \"Ho, ho, ho!\" He was surprised that the eyes, the surprisingly gentle blue eyes, looked into him deeply and looked into him, looked into him, and he felt that he was seen and felt. He moved his heavy body, and the floor creaked under him. \"You've been waiting for me,\" he said again in a low voice, as if he were a sleigh bell. \"You've kept something for me, I think.\" And he pointed to a small, very richly carved box, which was on the coffee table.",
        " General ideas (for a younger girl, maybe five to ten): * Co-operative games: very good for the little ones, because all play together, avoiding frustration and encouraging co-operation. * Hoot-Hoot! * No-Nose Hockey * Animal-Themed Games: Owls & Owlettes (Pre-school): a simple matching game, where players help owls return to their nests before dawn, * Forbidden Island: a little more complex, but still a game for everyone, where you work together to collect treasure before the island sinks. * Then the Forbidden Island for the eldest (eight and up): a slightly more complex, but still easy-to-learn game, where you and your fellow players collect treasure and prevent the island sinking, * Tokaido (or anything that uses water and is fast-paced, and where each player can win or lose at the same time, but the game is still enjoyable, and is educational). * Dexterity games: little ones often enjoy games that are active. * Unicorn Glitterchuk (age four+): a simple dice game with delightful unicorn figurines, * Sleeping Queens (age eight+): a card game, where players are trying to wake sleeping queens, using kings, knights, and potions. * Fast-Paced, Simple Rules: * This will keep their interest. * Suspend (age eight+): a balancing game, where players try to balance weights on a frame, * Jenga (age six+): the classic game of building a tower. * UNO (age seven+): the classic card game, with simple rules, * Spot-It! (age six+): a game of visual perception, where players compete to find matching symbols. * Her interests: * * * How old is she? (The most important factor!) * * Princesses? Superheroes?

        " ... Stonehenge has been silently observing for centuries, a monument to the mysterious, mysterious time. The air is charged with expectancy, the tenseness hangs in the night. Around the ancient stones, a carefully selected circle stands in silent awe: scientists, theologians, philosophers and artists, representatives of the best minds in humankind. Tonight it is a scene of something completely unprecedented. The world watches. The gentle glow of the carefully placed lights is reflected in their faces, and a look of awe and terror. They have been questioned, prepared and sworn to secrecy. Is this true? The initial skepticism has given way to a breathless, almost desperate hope. Every screen, every receiver is tuned in to this picture. Energy readings are now spiking and jumping around the center stone. Is it possible? The technologist has reported that everything is in working order. And then it begins. They have been told to maintain a respectful silence, to observe and record, and not to interfere, no matter what they see. The stones seem to glow with an inner light. The air shimmers, as if the heat of a thousand suns has been concentrated here. A faint hum rises from the earth, a tremble that passes through the bones. And a swirling vortex of energy forms in the center of the circle, above the altar stone. The light, the color, that can not be comprehended by human beings, seems to mix and change into patterns that do not fit into geometry and logic, and which makes everything beautiful and terrifying at the same time. A form begins to emerge from the heart of the vortex. It is not a being, not something that can easily be defined. The hum grows louder and louder. Its presence is imposing, radiating ancient wisdom and profound understanding. It is... something else. A manifestation of pure energy, an embodiment of cosmic power. The leader of the scientific team, Aris Thorne, lifts his hand, and a question, a carefully prepared question, is asked. There is terror, reverence, on the faces of the chosen ones.mbling on his lips. He takes a deep breath and speaks, his voice barely a whisper against the backdrop of the humming energy. \"Creator... We are here to listen. We are here to learn. What is your message for humanity?\" The vortex pulses, the energy shifts. And then, a response. Not in words, not in sound, but in a direct transmission of pure thought, flooding the minds of everyone present. The message is complex, multifaceted, a tapestry of information that will take years, perhaps decades, to fully decipher. But one thing is clear. We are not alone. And the future of humanity, for better or worse, has just been irrevocably changed.\"",
        " “But Mother, it’s not a fan fiction!” I protested, turning away from the screen. “The light is really terrible.” “An alternative history with zombies which fits in with your political ideas,” she chimed in, merrily. “It’s... alternative history with zombies.” I was not really sure what she meant. The summer humidity had soaked everything, even the air. I wanted a new topic, something to divert my attention, preferably with some magic or ingenuity. I was thinking about dragons, or space pirates, or intelligent hamsters invading the government. But no, it was always... like this. I sighed. “Well, maybe it is a little too slanted,” I said. She was waving vaguely at the screen. “And anyway, Mother, it’s such an American idea! George Washington as a zombie. He is incorruptible!” she chortled, a warm, familiar chortle. “Literally. He’s already dead.” “Until he starts gnawing on brains, I suppose. And I don’t think the founders imagined that the Constitution would be defended by zombies.” I was starting to see that she had a point. “Yes, yes, it needs some work, but it’s basically sound.” “I think people want cheap health care and a decent salary,” she answered, leaning against the door. “Not necessarily the end of the world, brought on by a president turned zombie.” “And you are deliberately... ‘topical’,” she said, her eyes flashing. “You are being deliberately obtuse.” “I’m not saying you shouldn’t write your little stories. But you might want to try looking at things from a different angle, don’t you think?” “Zombie George Washington, fighting for social justice. What about a George Washington who gnaws on a homeless man’s brain to make him a Republican?” “Or,” she continued, “you could just write about the intelligent hamsters. That would be different. Maybe even... interesting.” “Intelligent hamsters? That would be funny.”I grinned. \"Okay, okay. Maybe I'll brainstorm some hamster ideas. But Zombie George is staying. He just might need a little... re-evaluation.\" She smiled, a genuine, supportive smile that made me feel a little less defensive. \"That's all I'm saying. Now, are you coming to the pool? It's too hot to be cooped up in here, no matter how many undead presidents you conjure up.\" I hesitated, glancing back at the laptop. Zombie George was staring blankly back at me from the screen, his pixelated face a silent challenge. \"Alright,\" I said, closing the laptop with a decisive click. \"Pool time. Maybe the chlorine will give me some new ideas.\" As I followed my mother out of the room, I couldn't help but",
        " It was not the death of Doctor Chadford, the village doctor, which caused the greatest commotion in the little village of Sumperton. This man, who at the age of 56 had sat as a doctor in the village, who had, from the age of two, administered remedies and dispensing counsels, was a part of the people, and not a mere doctor. His death was sudden, unexpected, overwhelming. It was announced that he had had a heart-attack. Fifty-six was no age, especially for one so full of life. At first no one thought of accusing anyone. But as the days became weeks, a sombre air came over the place, thicker than the mist which clung to the fields. People began to whisper, and in their whisperings a suspicion of something became distinctly more apparent. People said that he had walked many miles a day, he had eaten sparingly, and that he had even had a state-of-the-art apparatus inserted in his heart. But the doctor was careful with his health. The first break in the truth was caused by the baker's wife, a woman as well known for her gossip as her sourdough bread, who said that she had seen a strange car on the night before his death. The doctor's heart-apparatus had not registered anything abnormal during the days before his death. The baker's wife could not remember what make it was, but she swore that she had seen it in the darkness. Then old Hemlock, the historian of the village, and the doyen of all Sumpertonians, found in the local records something that alarmed him. It was a deed of deeds, going back to the reign of Queen Victoria, a deed which referred to a land-dispute between the Chadfords and the Blackwoods, a name which for generations had been held sacred by the villagers. They had been known for their unbridled ambition and their ability to get their way.speculation, a single question hung in the air, heavier than the scent of woodsmoke on a winter's night: could Doctor Chadford's death have been more than just a tragic accident? And if so, who in Sumperton held the key to unlocking the truth?",
        " July 1916. Officers have been going over the top, one by one, every day; it is a revolting habit. They sound the whistle, the men surge forward, and then nothing more. Every morning, with the same terror, the same gnawing fear, that today it may be your turn or the turn of some one you know, some one you have talked to, who has passed the cigarette with you and exchanged a joke. Or else the screams. The shells fall, drum and drill, and it eats into you. We are told that it is the officers who go first, that it is because we lead by example, that we are to be seen and heard. And it is true, it is reasonable. There are always new ones, fresh ones, adolescent boys, patriotic, with the naive belief in glory. But here you are nothing but a target; a target for the snipers, a target for the machine-gunners, a target for the cursed artillery, which never sleeps. It is a waste of life. They last a week, two at the most, and then they are swallowed up in the mud and the blood. I try to recall what we are fighting for: liberty? It is a terrible, senseless waste. I am thinking only of how I am going to survive. France? All this seems so remote, so abstract, compared with the horrible reality of this trench. I am thinking only of getting through one day, and of keeping the men alive, knowing that most of them will not. This morning it has begun to rain again. It seems to me that the whole world is weeping over the dead, and I weep too. It mixes with the mud and turns into a sticky clot which clings to everything, which freezes your bones. I just want this to end, God knows.",
        " 'It's either witchcraft,' one person said in a hushed voice, to general hilarity. \"It's either that, or a schizophrenic,\" said another with too much seriousness. We all talked about her, of course. Our English teacher, Mr. Peterson, gave us a group task one day. Her dark hair hanging over her face, her over-sized black clothes, the terrible intensity of her gaze, if she looked at something, all that was wrapped up in that mystery or rather, the eerieness. I tried to ignore it, but she was hard to ignore. Mr. Peterson pointed to me and sighed, pointing to me, \"Sarah, you are together with her.\" Naturally, everyone rushed to their friends and only a lonely one was left in the back row. But Mr. Peterson's eyes were determined and I knew that there was no point in resisting. I'd rather dissect a frog than sit next to Hanna. \"Hello,\" I said in a hushed voice. Hanna didn't answer. I carried my books to the back of the classroom and sat down with a dull weight, a whisper trailing after me like a shadow. The drawing she was drawing in her notebook looked familiar. A bloody, red eye was staring out, surrounded by sharp, pointed, knife-like lines. No answer. It was as if I were talking to a brick wall. \"We should probably... uh... figure out what we're going to do,\" I mumbled, waving my hand in front of the instructions. I cleared my throat. \"It's about analyzing a poem. Maybe we should do Poe's raven. \" Hanna looked up, her eyes stared at mine in a strange green. I felt as if a thin strand of vulnerability slipped into the eerieness. \"No,\" she said in a voice that was surprisingly soft, \"let's do Annabel Leifson.\" I blinked in astonishment. \"Annabel Leifson? It's a bit dark, isn't it?'t it?\" It was about a young woman who dies, leaving her lover heartbroken and obsessed. Hannah's gaze didn't waver. \"Yes. It is.\" And just like that, I was drawn in. Not by the creepy drawings, or the rumors, but by the quiet intensity in her eyes and the unexpected suggestion of a shared understanding of something dark and beautiful. Maybe, just maybe, Hannah wasn't as weird as everyone thought. Maybe she was just... different. And maybe, just maybe, I was about to find out why.",
        " She returned to the room, ten minutes after she had set out, when the rain began. Drops of water, like tiny sparks, were sparkling on her eyelashes, and her eyes, through the veil of their moisture, viewed the scene as if through a water-color. Her hair was dancing before her face, she was shivering in spite of the summer heat. I knew very well what she had forgotten. “Forgotten anything?” I said, leaning against the door-post, and trying to suppress a smile. “It has just—begun to rain, and without any reason.” And she shook her head, splashing the water over the floor. She removed her dripping cloak, and a puddle remained where it had lain. “Well, that is summer in this town,” I said, nodding, and pointing to the window through which the rain was falling in torrents. “You have not heard the weather report?” she asked. “I did, and they said, ’Scattered Showers of Rain.’ But there is more than one of them.” I was rather annoyed at myself, for I ought to have warned her more emphatically. She was looking defeated, her shoulders drooping. “There,” I said, moving from the door-post, “let me get you a towel.” I was all too well acquainted with this particular summer downpour. I had a feeling that this was no short-lived shower. “And you can have some dry clothes, too,” I said. She followed me into the room where the fire was crackling in the grate. I rummaged in the linen cupboard, and brought out a thick, fluffy towel, my shirt and trousers. They were rather too big for her, but at least they were dry. The sky was a threatening grey, the wind howled like a hungry wolf. “Don’t mind,” I said. “You must feel ridiculous enough, without my clothes, too.” “Thank you,” she muttered, taking them. A faint smile appeared on her lips. “This happens to everybody,” I said, in an amiable tone, “it is a good excuse for us to do nothing at all.” “It does sound very attractive.” She disappeared into the bathroom, and I stoked the fire with another log. The heat was soon suffusing the room, driving away the chill of the damp air.. I could hear the faint sound of her showering, the water drumming against the porcelain. When she emerged, she looked much better. The oversized clothes swallowed her, but she looked comfortable and relaxed. Her hair was pulled back in a messy bun, and her cheeks were flushed pink from the warmth of the shower. \"So,\" she said, settling onto the couch. \"What do you suggest we do with our unexpected indoor afternoon?\" I grabbed the remote and flipped through the channels. \"Movies? Board games? We could even try baking something. I've always wanted to make those complicated-looking sugar cookies.\" She laughed. \"I think I'd rather stick to movies. Baking with you sounds like a recipe for disaster",
        " Thirty minutes. Ten minutes. The minute hand, a thin silver-shafted lance, relentlessly advanced. Outside, the world hummed with the symphony of automobiles, voices, and the gentle rustling of leaves, while in this barren room I heard only the monotonous tick-tock of the metronome, the painful slowdown of time. In the sterile silence of this room, time seemed to have stopped. My muscles ached, paralyzed by inaction. I shifted on the hard plastic chair to find a position that offered some comfort, but the flickering of the fluorescent lights hummed at me, a low, disturbing counterpoint to the metronome. But I couldn’t. I longed to stretch out, to walk, to do something, anything to break this hypnotic monotony. I wanted to move and change places, I wanted to run away from here. But I was chained to this spot, tied to the invisible, corroding chain of obligation, hope, and impatience. In front of the closed door, what? The steel grating and the thick slab of glass formed a formidable barrier between me and my questions. Would I succeed? Fail? Fail? Fail? Would I ever succeed? I closed my eyes and tried to imagine a different scene—a sunny beach, the warm sand between my toes, the sound of the waves. But uncertainty gnawed at me like an implacable, maddening hunger. When I opened my eyes again, the minute hand had moved. My fantasy flickered and vanished, drowned out by the incessant tick-tock of the metronome, the unrelenting tick-tock, a reminder that time was slipping away, slipping away. Anything to escape from this moment, this room. The treadmill continued, a ruthless, devouring cycle that threatened to engulf me. Another thirty minutes. I was not yet through. The longest wait was probably still ahead.",
        " BILL was not a rich man, but he was a good man. He always met everybody with a smile and a kindly word, though he was struggling himself. His riches were not to be measured in money, but in the little services he rendered to his fellow-men. He helped old Mrs. Gable with her groceries; he cut the lawn when old Mr. Henderson was ill; he gave the children a piece of candy whenever they called on him. He lived in a little house on the outskirts of town, on a hill. The house was rather tumble-down, the paint was peeling off, and the garden was overgrown, but inside it was always warm and comfortable. And on a lovely autumn day, a young woman named Sarah was moving into the house next door. She seemed very anxious and dissatisfied, for the boxes were all piled up in the front and the back of the house and the last belongings were hardly in the car. Bill saw her distress and did not hesitate to help her. He said, in his rough, yet friendly voice, “Welcome to the neighborhood. It looks as if you needed an extra pair of hands.” He came over and, taking off his old gloves, offered his services. Bill helped her all afternoon, unpacking and arranging the furniture. He even helped her to mend a leak in the kitchen. And as the sun was setting, Sarah, very tired, but very grateful, offered him some home-made cookies, which she had baked in the morning. “Thank you, Bill,” she said, her eyes flashing. “You have saved my life. I wouldn’t have been able to manage without you.” “It was my pleasure, my girl,” said Bill, smiling, with a sincere smile, which reached his eyes. He knew he was not rich in money, but he was rich in heart and in goodness, and this, he thought, was worth more than all the money in the world. And when he left her that evening, he felt very happy and satisfied, for he knew that without money he was able to give a helping hand.",
        " Day 27. The Pregla Island Expedition. The stiff, cold wind blew on our faces as the zodiac skimmed along the shore of Pregla Island, filled with a strong smell of sea salt and something more, something old, earthy, which gave the sense of some inaccessible rock, a thousand-year-old wonder, hidden mystery. ... Professor Armitage, his thick beard masking a grim, determined expression, pointed to a narrow, rocky inlet. “That’s where we’ll land. Get the equipment ready and let’s hurry.” The equipment was geiger counters, geological hammers, sample bags and a powerful sonar device that Dr Chen hoped would penetrate the thick undersea rock formations. I was the photographer and reporter of the expedition, and with all the equipment and the awesome presence of Pregla Island, it seemed quite insignificant. The weather forecast was predicting that the storm would worsen towards evening. Pregla Island was no more than a steep black volcanic cliff erupting out of the turbulent waves. Blackish green lichen clung stubbornly to the stubborn rocks, and there were no trees on it, only thorny, gnarled shrubs shivering in the wind. As we unloaded the equipment, an icy spray of water sprayed over us from the pounding waves. My spine tingled, and it was not only because of the cold. The zodiac, well steered, unloaded the equipment, moored to a rocky ridge. “Alright, people,” said Professor Armitage in a low voice over the wind, “Chen, you and Dr Davies will set up the sonar equipment at the entrance of the bay, and Miller and I will make a geological survey inland. So I said, “O’Connell, keep up with us, report everything.” We disembarked. With the professor, the young geologist Miller walked in a nervous hurry.rocky interior. Chen and Davies began wrestling with the sonar equipment, their faces etched with concentration. I, meanwhile, started snapping photographs, trying to capture the desolate beauty of the island. Hours passed in a blur of wind, rain, and the relentless pounding of the waves. I followed Armitage and Miller as they chipped away at rock faces, collecting samples and muttering about geological formations I couldn't comprehend. The island felt oppressive, claustrophobic despite its vastness. The ancient scent, that earthy, almost metallic tang, grew stronger, clinging to the back of my throat. Around mid-afternoon, the weather took a turn for the worse. The wind howled like a banshee, and the rain intensified, blurring the already bleak landscape. Armitage, his face pale, called us back to the inlet. \"We need to pack up",
        " We welcomed them as saviors, offered them our world and our thanks, and in return they offered us technology that surpassed our most exalted dreams, medical knowledge and cures for all diseases, a way out of scarcity and hunger. Their sleek silver ships hung in the sky, silent sentinels of peace, promising an end to the famines, the droughts and the petty wars that have plagued this world for centuries. The first steps were subtle. They restricted certain forms of technology, using the excuse of ‘safety protocols’. We were children, blinded by the dazzling spectacle of their marvelous toys, blind to the cold calculation in their eyes. Then the re-education programs began, with their doctrine of ‘harmonization’, removing the peculiarities of our cultural makeup, eroding the nuances of our language, and presenting the world to us in a bland, uniform image. Those who dared to speak out, those who remembered their promise of true liberation, were silenced. Then came the changes in our way of life, with a little by little overturning of formerly accepted ways, to achieve ‘a greater efficiency’. The shiny cities they built for us, once symbols of hope, were now the monuments to our own foolishness, the prisons of our own making. Those who had defended us had become jailers, and those who had saved us had become slave-masters. All dissent was crushed with brutal savagery. We had traded our freedom for our security, our independence for our comfort. Now, under their watchful eye, we were trapped, and we were wondering if survival was worth paying the price of our souls. The air, once rich with the scents of the earth, now tainted by their metallic breath, constantly reminded us of our subjugation. And the question that haunted us was: could anything be salvaged from the wreckage? The guardians had come, and with them our own demise.",
        " He was not ostentatious about his riches, he had a quiet, self-confident air which came from him like a faint hum. He adjusted his silk scarf, the fine pattern of which caught the light, and a whiff of expensive eau de cologne, a mixture of sandalwood and lemon, seemed to come from his person. He stopped by a news-vendor and read the newspapers critically; he did not buy one, but he took out a silver-pointed pen and a small Moleskine notebook. He carried a leather pocket-book, the edges worn with use but carefully kept. He glanced at the street with an expert, almost penetrating gaze, taking in every detail: a crack in a painted wall, a hurrying pedestrian, the gleam of light on a distant window. He made a note of something, his brow knit with concentration, and pushed the notebook back into the inside pocket of his coat. The pen clicked shut, with a reassuring sound, and the notebook went back into the inside pocket of his coat. Then he seemed to be waiting for someone, or something, a fine tension pulled the corners of his mouth, and revealed the slightest flicker of impatience under the surface of his perfect manner. There was about him an air of observation, of penetration, of scrutiny, as if he were registering everything around him.",
        " “Oh, darling, there are, you know, little tears on her face,” the child went on, as if ashamed of her knowledge. But, of course, the tears were there; the girl had spent hours, days even, pressing the face of the doll against her own face, whispering her own anxieties into her ear, without any fear that it might ever hear her. She ran her finger over the stained place, swallowing down the lump that was rising in her throat. It was a bit silly to be so solicitous about a doll. The doll, which she had named Lily after her grandmother, had probably absorbed more tears than her stuffing. But today the tears on Lily’s face were not those of the child. Lily was more than just a doll. She was a confidante, a silent witness of her turbulent childhood, an object of her longing for affection. In the corner of their room, where Maisie had been huddled all morning, Lily still clutched in her arms, a small, silent sob had shaken her. The tears were those of her little sister. Usually a whirlwind of laughter and sunshine, she had stayed in her bed all morning, and then it was time for her to go to school. So she had come and sat in the sun with her head on her sister’s lap, her face buried in Lily’s ragged clothes, her tears falling on to her lap, and her little sister kneeling down beside her, softly saying, “What is the matter, darling?” Mrs. Higgins was their infamously peevish neighbor with the prize-winning petunias, always grumpy, and her face buried in the folds of the fabric. “I—I broke Mrs. Higgins’ window,” she whispered, her voice muffled by the cloth. “You broke her window?” repeated her sister, trying to keep her voice quiet. She felt a mixture of concern for her sister and anger against Mrs. Higgins. “How?” she asked. Finally, the child raised her head, her face red and blotchy. “I was playing ball—and I hit it too hard,” the child murmured, burying her face in the folds of the cloth again. “All right. All right. You’re all right.” She knew that Maisie was a powerful swinger for her seven years. “Did you tell them?... Accidents happen.” She put an arm around her sister and pulled her close to her.her?\" Maisie shook her head, fresh tears welling in her eyes. \"I'm scared. She's going to be so mad!\" Ashley squeezed her sister tighter. \"I know, honey. But you have to tell her. It's the right thing to do.\" She looked at Lily, the silent witness to countless childhood dramas. An idea sparked in her mind. \"Here,\" she said, gently taking Lily from Maisie. \"Let's take Lily with us. She'll be our brave friend. And I'll be right there with you, okay? We'll tell Mrs. Higgins together.\" Maisie looked up at her, hope flickering in her tear-filled eyes. \"Really?\"",
        " Sergeant Miller, a face smeared with sweat and dust, ran his hand over his close-cropped hair. A general exhalation ran through the troop carrier. The tension, suffocating to the point of cutting with a vibro-blade, had finally relaxed. Static shivered on the wireless. \"Good work, sniper patrol. Confirm visual.\" \"No visual, Sergeant. Heavy smoke, charred timber, still no visual.\" A hit was a hit, but without visual confirmation it was a mere guess. The target area was completely covered by smoke. The patrol stepped up with caution. \"It's your turn, recon patrol. Expect resistance.\" A pair of figures, blending in with the devastated terrain, left the troop carrier, raising their weapons and skimming the ruins of what had once been a thronging marketplace. \"Intelligence reports secondary targets in the vicinity.\" \"Recon One to base,\" a lowered voice whispered on the radio. \"Approaching target area. Searching for secondary targets.\" Every step was measured, every shadow was examined. Visibility zero. Strong smell of.... fuel. \"Recon One to base. Indications are secondary explosions may be imminent. Copy?\" The minutes stretched into eternity. Smoke, the smell of smoldering metal and crumbling concrete. Forward with extreme caution. Suddenly a shout shattered the silence. \" Contact. Contact. Many hostiles, bearing on two-seven zero!\" The troop carrier's autocannon rattled and poured a volley of exploding bullets in the designated direction. \"Hostile fire sighted,\" Recon One screamed, his voice tearing with strain. The recon patrol ducked for cover, laying down a measured fire. The troop carrier moved into position. \"Troop carrier, recon patrol support!\" Miller didn't hesitate. \"Initial support!\" He grabbed his rifle, waving the squad to follow him. \"Suppressing fire! We're going in!\" The troop carrier lurched forward, the autocannon tearing the air.a path through the debris, providing a brief window of opportunity. As they charged into the smoke-filled ruins, the reality of the situation slammed into them. They weren't just facing insurgents. They were facing something far more dangerous. Figures clad in black armor, their faces obscured by menacing helmets, moved with unnatural speed and precision. Energy weapons crackled in the air, carving smoking trails through the wreckage. This wasn't just a target hit. This was a hornet's nest, and they had just kicked it. The war was about to get a whole lot uglier.",

        " The room was tidy and empty, the sunlight filtered through the window and painted a warm rectangle on the floor, where dust motes were circling lazily in the golden beam, the only sign of movement in the air. A corner was taken by an ancient rocking-chair of glossy, dark wood, an old thing, its sides worn down, its seat worn, all looking as though by long, loving use. The walls were painted a pale, ethereal blue, reflecting the sky outside and giving to the room a sense of spaciousness, in spite of its small dimensions. The whole room seemed to be vibrating with a gentle hum, a vibration rather than a sound, something like the vibration of an old house settling, and yet something else as well, something barely perceptible. Over the back of the chair a small, faded, hand-knitted rug hung, bringing a feeling of domesticity to the otherwise bare and chilly atmosphere. But this impression of bareness, despite the fact that the room was empty, was not created by an absence of furniture; on the contrary, it was as though the air in the room were weighed down with the expectation of something happening to break the silence.",
        " In the twilight of the corridor, its usually vacant eyes, which had become duller, seemed to flash. I expected it to quack, or at least to rock on its pedestal. “Good work,” I said to the stuffed duck standing on the threshold of my cell. “Don’t stand there, Fluffy,” I said, uttering the absurd name I had given it several weeks before, in a fit of conversation and boredom. It neither moved nor uttered a sound; it simply stood there, a fluffy, brown-clothed sentry in a threadbare orange suit. The duck said nothing, and its papier-mâché beak was forever fixed in a smile that was once cheerful and was now strangely uneasy. “They send you? Is it time yet?” I asked. Finally, they’d decided that I was ready, or perhaps they were tired of feeding me. Was I ready? My heart was pounding wildly against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat in the silence of the cell. I rubbed my hand through my disheveled hair, and as I did so, a cloud of dust, shed in the twilight, danced in the weak sunlight filtering through the bars of the high window. I was totally exhausted, and the course had exhausted me to the last drop of my strength. Had I proved my worth? The questions swirled in my mind, a chaos of dread and doubt. I pushed myself up, and the rusty bed groaned against me. I had faced my demons, had recognized my past, and had learned to control... But then again, no, it was still a secret. The duck didn’t move; its eyes didn’t even blink. That was because it was an inanimate object, or perhaps because the drug they put in the water had reached its brain. I approached the duck, and held out my hand to it. “Right,” I said, in a voice that was husky from disuse. My hand trembled as I grasped a small, neatly folded paper that Fluffy was holding in its wing. I tore it open, and read a simple sentence:scrawled in spidery handwriting: *“The duck is not your friend. It is a distraction. Look behind you.”*",
        " If you want to make your story more interesting, you will need to tell me what the title was about. I can't go to that page. So I need to know the premise.

(eg time travel, a certain archetype of character, a specific setting, a moral dilemma) What were the specific requirements or limitations of the title?

        " It was like being interrogated under a lamp, only instead of a burning white, it was a burning orange. I closed my eyes, trying to see the faces; the light was fierce, my eyes were watering, it was difficult to see. Were they playing a trick on me? Was it some kind of power game? I was uncomfortable, and tried to find some small shadow, but the position was fixed. The fact that they might not be aware of it made me angry.",
        " “I live in the utmost tranquillity. But tranquillity does not mean emptiness. I live with my husband, with whom I have spent 62 years of my life.” The adventures that fill our days are now less of scaling peaks than of finding our way in the grocery store without getting lost in the cereal aisle. It is the tranquillity of a well-known ticking clock, the tranquillity of hearing your lover’s breathing. I sit at the window and watch the birds flitting about the branches of the old oak tree in the garden. Sometimes we stroll slowly through the aisles of the store, he with a hand resting on the small of my back, we discuss the coffees, a discussion that goes on for decades, but in the end we always buy the same one. Together we have seen so many things: wars, triumphs, disasters, the small everyday miracles that make up a life. He will bring me my tea, just the way I like it, watery, with a slice of lemon, and we sit in companionable silence, the sound of our mugs clinking softly. He has deeper wrinkles, like mine. We have built a home, brought up a family, weathered storms that would have destroyed other ships, but here we are still afloat, still together, still looking for solace in each other’s presence. But as I look at him I do not see the years marking his face, I see the young man I fell in love with, the one who has stayed by my side through thick and thin, the one who is and will always be my home. His hair is thinner, and mine has gone grey. It is a tranquillity I would not exchange for all the noise in the world. In the tranquillity of our lives together I find a deep, lasting peace, the peace of love, of loyalty, of all our memories.",
        " The theatrical setting, the resonant lighting, the exaggerated dialogue—they were all calculated to produce emotion, but they were all empty. It wasn’t real. Everyone knew it. But that didn’t diminish the experience. Fear, joy, the heartbreak of death—it all echoed in our hearts, like a phantom echo of a genuine experience. We were puppets on strings, dancing to a tune that was heard only by the director. Perhaps that was the whole point. We knew the stage was a lie, but the emotion was undeniable. We wept real tears for fictional characters, and we were angry at imagined injustices. The emotion reminded us that we were alive. But recently, something was becoming terribly wrong. A nagging sense of discontent had begun to grip me. Was the director beginning to lose control? There were signs. The faintest shift in the director’s gaze, a slight tremor in the carefully constructed story. People began to whisper. We questioned our existence. The stage was a lie. What was the truth? Or was this just another scene in the play? Could we find out the truth? Were we brave enough?",
        " My body trembled at every step, and yet the skin was sluggishly unbroken. The dull ache in my bones seemed to have dated from the beginning of time, as though my bones had been dug up from some prehistoric ruin. The gas-lamps cast my shadow with long, distorted proportions; the street-lamps played a mocking game, as though they were teasing me with my awkward movements. I fumbled for my keys, the cold metal of which I was now strange, the cold metal that had frozen my hands. No red welts, no purple bruises; nothing but a virgin skin stretched taut over a body that seemed to have gone through ten rounds with a world-champion boxer. My memory was a revolving blackout. Had I been robbed? Had I been tortured in some surreal realm, where there were no bruises? I finally got my key into the lock, and staggered inside. The last thing I remembered was——no, I could remember nothing. I turned on the lamp and the sober, everyday reality of my sitting-room appeared in a blur; the shabby armchair, the overcrowded bookshelves, the puzzle left half done on the table. The familiar scent of cinnamon and old books was usually comforting, but now it was foreign, distant. There was a faint mark on my cheek, some dark substance that could easily be rubbed off. My reflection in the hall mirror revealed nothing. My eyes were wide and vacant, the surface of them shining with panic. A cup of tea would help, perhaps some strong drink. I slogged toward the kitchen, my shoes clattering against the parquet floor. A small velvet-lined box, catching my eye. I lifted the lid with a feeling of curiosity that outweighed the pain in my limbs. A single iridescent feather, exquisitely formed, lay on the satin bed. It was a single ray of sun. I picked it up, my hands burning with it. I felt some of the chill leave my body., a fragmented image flashed through my mind: soaring through the night sky, the wind rushing through my... feathers? The feeling of power, of boundless freedom, and then... a sudden, jarring impact. Could it be possible? Had I... flown? The feather pulsed gently in my hand. I stared at it, a strange mix of disbelief and dawning understanding swirling within me. The aches, the lack of bruises, the fragmented memory... it all started to make a horrifying, yet exhilarating, kind of sense. I was going to need a very strong cup of tea. And maybe a very, very long lie down. Because I had a feeling my life was about to get a lot more complicated. And a lot more... feathered.",
        " A weak sun through the filthy window illumined a patch of dust, mocking my still life in my veins. The paper on the wall, once alive with flowers, now seemed a rotting carcass, clinging to the bare plaster of the room. The air was thick, sticky, and full of the scent of dust, decay, and a vague chemical odor, which clung to my throat. My trembling fingers, stupid and clumsy, could not handle the needle. The rubber tourniquet burned my skin, a familiar pain, which I almost welcomed; in this world, which was numbing my body, it was a definite feeling. There, a blue thread barely beating under the skin, I found the vein. A sharp pain, then the rush of the drug. Long practice did not alter the ritual, the small flicker of hope that arose before each preparation. The world melted at the edges, and the shabby, condemned place, the heavy choice, all receded for a moment. But the relief was a liar. It was not the long-awaited euphoria I was chasing, but a warm, quick momentary oblivion. Then it was the same. As the flood swelled, the shadows deepened in the room and coalesced into vaguely familiar forms. A small, faded photograph lay on the floor. It showed a laughing woman whose eyes were filled with the light I no longer possessed. It whispered against me, accusing me of what I knew to be true. The drug was fading, and the warmth of it was replaced by a brutal clarity, brutality. Mother. The guilt rushed in, a torrent, ready to overflow. And I knew, with a chilling certainty, that this was not living, it was a slow, agonizing death. I was alone in a room, in a dead building, and I was poisoning my veins. I looked at the discarded needle on the floor, a silent witness to my self-destruction.my stomach. Was this it? Was this how my story ended? A sudden sound broke the silence - the creak of a floorboard downstairs. Someone was here. Panic flared, a primal instinct for survival overriding the apathy that had consumed me. I had to get out. I had to escape this tomb, this self-made prison. Maybe, just maybe, there was still a chance to rewrite the ending. But first, I had to move. Now.",
        " I assure myself that I am not asking questions, not really. With each gulp, a temporary healing is poured over the sharp edges of the day. The amber liquid in the glass turns around in the dim light like a trapped sunset,... A few quiet moments, a little quiet, a little calm, a little peace, a little... ah, the anxiety that goes around in the bones. Maybe tomorrow will be better. I am slowly gulping, the ice rattles a little, and the thick silence is broken only by the sigh. Perhaps. For now, there is only the whiskey, and the shaky illusion of peace that it gives me.",
        " My vision dimmed. The world shifted on its axis. I felt a terrible bursting in the space behind my eyes. It was not a localized pain; it spread from the center and seemed to penetrate the very base of my skull. My legs were about to give way. A pressure, immense and teeming with impatience, bore down on me, down, down. A shrill, shrill whine filled my ears and drowned out all other sounds. I felt something metallic in my mouth, sour and coppery—was it blood? I was falling, but the ground was swiftly approaching me, warped and unreal. Panic clawed at my throat; I wanted to scream, but a silence was uttered, a silence stifled in the midst of the crushing pressure. My muscles were convulsing, trying to escape from the unforeseen power. But it was useless. “Stop! Stop! Please stop! My thoughts were shattered and shattered like a glass. There was a moment, a moment so brief that it is indefinable, a moment of frightful clarity. The questions were absurd and were swallowed up by the torment. And then all ceased to exist. I understood with a chilly certainty that it was over. There was nothing, only a great darkness, a great, silent emptiness that engulfed everything. The pain, the pressure, the terror—all dissolved into an arid, echoing void.",
        " A cold shiver ran down my spine, despite the warmth of the afternoon sun that streamed through the living room window. Through the crack in the door a large yellow eye was looking out, its pupils catlike; it was motionless, without blinking, as if examining me with its predatory gaze. My breath was taken away. I had not heard a knock or a creak of the hinges, but only the one fixed, frightening eye. I approached the door slowly and cautiously. Was it a prank by a child? Or... something else? The eye did not blink, did not seem to be aware of my presence; it remained motionless, a silent, yellow, staring orb. My hand shook as I reached for the handle. The eye blinked slowly and deliberately. In the afternoon sun I saw Mrs. Higgins, my old neighbor, with her white hair. I took a deep breath and flung open the door. “Oh, my!” she said, her voice a little breathless. Her face, usually an old-woman’s, kind, wrinkled visage, was partially hidden by the doorway. But the eye, the terrifying yellow eye, was visible. “I didn’t mean to frighten you. I’ve lost my glasses again. I was just wondering if you had seen them.” The staring yellow eyes, the stillness and motionlessness were a delusion, an optical illusion of a dimly lit room. I stared at her in amazement. “No, Mrs. Higgins, I haven’t,” I stammered, feeling foolish. “My glasses?” “I... I was frightened. I’m so sorry.” “Oh, don’t worry. I’ve lost them so many times. It happens to the best of us!” And she chuckled, a dry, papery laugh. “It’s my eyes, you know, old eyes that don’t see as well. Things seem to me to be somewhat distorted, especially through a crack in a door.” A sardonic smile came to her lips.genuine, reassuring smile that crinkled the corners of her eyes. The tension that had gripped me began to dissipate. \"Well,\" she said, adjusting the collar of her faded floral dress, \"best be off to find them. Thank you for your time, dear.\" She turned and shuffled back towards her own door, her figure shrinking into the dim hallway. I watched her go, still slightly shaken. As I closed my own door, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just seen something... other. Something hidden behind the familiar facade of my kind, elderly neighbor. Something lurking just beneath the surface of those yellow eyes. And as I looked through the peephole, just to be sure, I couldn't help but wonder if Mrs. Higgins'",
        " ‘Loupi!’ I can’t bear it when he calls me that, it’s always a condescending, syrupy-sweet word, concealing an icy sting of disapproval. It’s a mark of ownership he’s slapped on me, a reminder of some intimacy between us that doesn’t exist. When my parents use it, it means ‘you’ve done something wrong’, but with him it’s something different. ‘Liam,’ I reply, as coldly as I can, ‘do you need anything?’ I grit my teeth, a forced smile coming to my face.",
        " He was not a king, not a general, not even a particularly gifted craftsman. The flickering flames danced on his face, the marks of a thousand sleepless nights etched deeper into his aging, wrinkled skin. He sat, he who had begun it all. He had not meant to do so, he had merely wished to feed his family and keep the wolf from the door in a country where famine was perpetual. He was simply a baker, Elias, and he had brought about a revolution with the smell of his leaven. The first loaves had been given away, bartered for work, shared with neighbors. But his bread was different from the coarse, tasteless mash that the rest of the country ate, it was nourishing, full of promise. People were willing to pay, and he continued to bake, nervously. And then they came from afar, drawn by the tempting smells that drifted along the cobblestones. Elias had not joined in the whisperings, not at first. Whispers about the baron, his overflowing granaries while the people starved. Whispers about the taxes, the feckless guards, the hopelessness of the future. Elias had taken the stone, and given it away, for the boy’s skin stretched tight over his ribs. And with tears in his eyes the boy said, “Your bread, it tastes like freedom.” And Elias had listened. The revolution was won, and the work was only beginning. And now, weeks later, the baron was overthrown, his granaries had been opened, and Elias sat before the fire, exhausted and overwhelmed. He had been the spark. He had been the trigger, the small hand that had set the wheel in motion. But he was no leader, he knew nothing of power, of politics. He looked down at his hands, rough and dusty with flour, his hands that had kneaded the dough and fed a hungry nation. He had known only how to bake.And maybe, just maybe, that was enough to build a better future. He reached for a piece of wood, intending to stoke the fire, and a single thought echoed in his mind: What now? The hunger had been sated, but the hunger for something more, something better, was just beginning to gnaw. The revolution of the belly was over. The revolution of the soul was about to begin.",
        " The pathologist hummed a vague melody which he did not recognize, but the melody came back to him like a faint metallic odor which was in the air. It was a childish tune, a saccharine, insipid little tune that he had sworn to have forgotten; it came to him now, stirred up by the sterile smell of formalin and the rhythmic scratching of the scalpel. The humming grew louder, perhaps to drown the hum of the ventilation system, which alone was breaking the silence. He hardly noticed it. He neatly slashed the sternum, the ribs cracked with a startling thud. He looked into the chest cavity, an organ and blood-vessel landscape laid bare by the harsh, florescent light. A simple time, when he was young, with his head in a comic book, with the radio playing that very same tune. ... He was impersonal, of course. A sigh escaped from his lips, a puff of steam momentarily darkened the face-shield. The corpse was a young woman, no more than twenty years old, to judge by the still-juvenile puffiness of the tissues. But that immature youth he was dealing with reverberated in him, an insistent, soft ache. He was a professional, he had to be. The tune in his head grew melancholy, he had never heard it in this key before, had he missed a minor chord? He reached for a pair of forceps, his hand, in its rubber glove, plunged into the crimson depths. He pulled a small, plastic bag out of the woman's stomach; it was ripped, and the fine, white powder it contained was sprayed over the stainless steel table. Or was his own mood coloring the melody? The humming in his head suddenly stopped. He knew. He inhaled, the smell of formalin had an unwelcome, bitter nuance. The humming stopped, the silence grew heavier, more profound, and he closed his eyes for a moment, thinking of his daughter, who was a teenager.than before. He opened his eyes, picked up his scalpel, and began again. The song was silenced, but the feeling remained, a cold, hard knot in the pit of his stomach. The work, unfortunately, was far from over.",
        " “Beep, beep, beep.” My hand groped for the snooze button, a familiar dance I performed almost every morning. I awoke with a start. A few seconds later I was laying there, trying to assemble the jumbled pieces of a dream in which I had flown a talking toaster through a field of oversized pastries. And then silence. The blessed, blessed silence. The room was still dark except for the sliver of predawn light seeping through the curtain. The cold floor gave me shivers, but I groped for the lamp switch anyway. I definitely needed more sleep. In the twilight the silence outside was eerie; a single car was heading toward me, its lights cutting through the darkness. I stumbled to the window and flung it open. Another day, another dollar. I stretched, the aching in my muscles protesting. The air smelled of damp earth and something flowery, probably my neighbor’s roses. I glanced at the clock on my nightstand. Or rather: another day, another mountain of code. I worked from home, a freelance programmer. I was used to working whenever I liked, so the line between my professional and personal life was nearly invisible. I was a creature of habit, prone to routinization. Six o’clock, bang on schedule. First, a coffee, then a quick shower. My morning schedule was a well-rehearsed dance, a choreographed choreography to reduce distractions and get the most out of my day. I headed for the bathroom, the floorboards squeaking under my feet. Then I would have a quick breakfast and look over my day’s schedule. And then, bug-hunting would begin. It wasn’t the refrigerator; I knew that sound. I had reached the door when I heard it. A faint, persistent humming from below. I paused for a moment, wondering whether to disregard it and continue with my daily schedule. But curiosity, that dangerous companion, had its way with me. This was different. And the humming grew a little louder. In spite of myself, I opened the door., I turned and headed towards the stairs. The humming grew stronger with each step, vibrating in the air around me. I reached the bottom of the stairs and peered into the living room. The source of the noise was immediately apparent. My laptop, sitting on the coffee table, was glowing with an eerie, pulsating light. The screen was filled with a jumble of code, scrolling rapidly, and the humming emanated from the speakers. I approached cautiously, a knot of unease tightening in my stomach. I hadn't left my laptop on last night. In fact, I was almost certain I had shut it down completely. So what was going on? As I drew closer, I noticed something else. The code on the screen wasn't just random gibber",
        " Jacob went through the throng, which had already reached the walls of the restaurant, with a nagging feeling of anxiety in his stomach. He heard various remarks, the quarrels about reservations, the implorations for tables, and the sighs of tired families with hungry children. A strong odor of frying meat and cheap perfumes mixed with desperation. He pushed past a woman who was struggling with a pram, muttering an apology, which was lost in the clamor. He was late, very late. Jacob was supposed to meet Sarah here for their anniversary dinner; they had been planning it for weeks, an occasional solitary night away from babies and deadlines. He was searching for her face, looking intently. Maybe she had already left, irritated by his tardiness. Now, perhaps, the careful preparations were already crumbling in the first minute. He pulled out his mobile phone, the digits on the button. He had to find her. Or worse: something must have happened. He took a deep breath to calm his growing agitation. And at that very moment he saw her. He squeezed between two men who were arguing about the ribs that were famous here, and his heart beat against his ribs like a stricken bird.",
        " No, this was different. It was not just a chill, though that was there too, a sharp reminder that summer was over. It was something in the air, in the cold wind that hit me when I got out of the shower. I shivered and hastily wrapped myself in a towel, but the strange feeling lingered. It was a prickling sensation, something like electricity, which covered my skin with goose bumps and made them rise up into prickly spikes. It was a feeling of anticipation. I looked around the steamy bathroom, as if expecting to see something wrong. I felt I was on the eve of something, something important. But everything was normal, mediocre. The half-empty bottle of shampoo, the toothpaste with a big gap in the middle, the shower curtain a little mildewed. A missing object, a shadow in the corner, anything that would explain the strangeness. I wrapped myself more closely in the towel, my heart pounding. But the air was still buzzing with that unnameable energy. It was a Tuesday morning. I walked into the bedroom, where the cold air seemed even colder. Perhaps I was coming down with something, something that manifested itself as a strange hallucination? I reached for my clothes and, as I did so, I saw the window. It was open, letting in a sliver of the twilight. It was snowing. A single snowflake, impossibly delicate, clinging to the glass, reflecting the faint light with a thousand dazzling rainbows. I had to touch it, and when my fingertip touched it, the electric sensation surged into my whole body, and the snowflake began to melt. I felt a memory, a vivid, unexpected memory, a memory of laughter, of snow-covered trees, a warm hand holding my hand, a memory both familiar and strange. But still the feeling, the prickling sensation of anticipation, was there. Something had shifted. The snowflake melted, leaving a single drop of water on my finger. And I knew, I felt it deep in my bones, that this day was to be a day of unordinary events. Something had been awakened.",

        " The heat was unbearable even under the layers of the protective garments. It ascended like a gnawing reminder of the planet's indifference to life. The crimson sun beat down with an ill-natured savagery, baking the ochre sands to a glimmering haze. The air, heavy and laden with iron and dust, scratched my lungs with each short breath. I had already encountered a glistening six-legged creature with razor-sharp pincers and iridescent scales that emitted a howl capable of splitting rock. “Poisonous animal life” was not just a warning given in the pre-mission briefing, it was a living presence. A sound of crawling from under the rock formations, and shadows in motion. The “dubious vegetation” was perhaps the most alarming. It had only retreated when I had unleashed a deafening sonic pulse from the hand device. Now I was proceeding with the utmost caution, constantly watching the horizon, my pulse drumming wildly against my ribs. Was it truly vegetation, or something else, something more sinister? Some kind of moss clung to the rock, but when I had brushed against it, it had sprang back with a movement that seemed almost conscious. Bare, gnarled trees climbed skywards, their branches encrusted with pulsating, luminous fungus. With every step my anxiety grew, my conviction that this planet was not meant to be disturbed grew stronger. It harboured ancient, hostile secrets, and I was invading sacred, forbidden ground. My mission was a simple one: to explore the potential for the exploitation of the local natural resources. The sun dropped down towards the horizon, painting the sky in vivid, shimmering shades of orange. The data I collected seemed insignificant, almost insulting, in the face of the planet's raw, unforgiving power. I could not rid myself of the sense that I was being watched, judged and condemned by something older, more powerful, than I could comprehend.hues of blood orange and bruised purple. Night was coming, and I knew, with a chilling certainty, that the dangers of this forbidding planet only intensified with the darkness.",
        " 'And it's painful, isn't it? Because somewhere, in the deepest recesses of my heart, there is a little voice that whispers to me that perhaps you're right. It hurts you to say it and it burns my entrails to hear it.' Perhaps is a slippery word, maybe I've gotten used to something, maybe I've stopped striving for something, maybe I've stopped believing in the one I've dreamed of. Life... life... life throws away responsibilities, disappointments, fears, and sometimes it suffocates everything with fatigue. There is an ideal, there is a potentiality, there is a glittering promise, which is always beyond reach. It's always there. Do I live with the guilt of the unrealized dream, do I tear myself apart to recapture a phantom? Perhaps the “might be” that I once longed for is no longer the same, maybe I have learned, grown, learned a new meaning of success and happiness. Or do I look at what I am today, see the path that has brought me here and ask myself what might still be within my reach? So, what do you mean when you say it? Maybe what might be is something completely new, something that has been reborn from the ashes. Do you see something still shining, I don't see it anymore.

        " CFL knew WOH since they were children, had built forts in the woods behind their homes and whispered secrets in the dark. The news about him was sketchy, whispers about a bad cough and the fact that he wasn’t himself. As she walked down the familiar streets, a lump formed in her stomach. She drove up to the weathered and peeling house, whose yard was usually kept neat and tidy. This time the grass was long and shaggy. The thought of him sick and alone tormented her. WOH had always taken great care of his yard. On the front porch a lone drooping sunflower hung from its pot. CFL waited, choking on her own tears. With trepidation she climbed the porch steps and knocked. WOH appeared before her, bent over, pale, gaunt, his eyes dull and unseeing. She waited and listened for any sound from within. After a while, she heard a shuffling. WOH looked up and slowly fixed his eyes on her. A racking cough shook him from head to toe. “C...” he said, weakly, strainedly. “What... what are you doing here, C...?” “W... W... W!” CFL said, her voice a mixture of surprise and relief. “I wanted to see you.” She held out her hand, but hesitated, his bones, how thin and frail he looked. “W... W...” WOH nodded, standing back and allowing her to enter. The air was heavy, stagnant, sickly, full of dust and illness. She felt a pit in her stomach. The blinds were closed and smothered the room in a heavy, dim light. She realized how much more urgent this visit was than she had realized. He was gravely ill. And he was alone.",
        " A cold sweat had gathered on my forehead and clung to my hands. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and my heart pounded against my ribs like a wild drummer in an empty concert hall. At the sound of the scream, I gave a start. I listened for a long time, trying to catch its source. It was no childish scream, as you hear on a roller coaster, but a scream that was raw, primitive, and reverberated deep in my own limbs. The silence that followed was almost more oppressive than the scream itself, a blanket that stifled all other sounds and intensified the pounding of my own pulse. Did it come from the woods behind the house or from further down the street? Should I call the police? The mindless chatter on the TV screen flickered like a poor contrast to the chilling reality that had just invaded my living room. I got up hesitantly from the chair, the springs complaining. Should I investigate? I peered out through the curtains. My mind was racing, my actions caught in a vise of indecision. I shivered. Whatever had made that scream was still there, crouching in the shadows, and I had a bad feeling that it would not go away by itself. The streetlamps cast long, distorted shadows, putting the familiar landscape in an uncanny light.",
        " The representatives of the working groups were all shifting uneasily around the table, and the moderator Sarah swallowed hard as if her throat were sandpaper. The air in the room, which was already heavy with tension, seemed to thicken further under Dan’s brusque outburst. Squinting through her spectacles, Sarah adjusted a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Right,” she said in a slightly shaky voice, adjusting her glasses and smiling without making her eyes crease. A sigh of protest from the crowd rang through the room. She clicked the remote control to advance the presentation, and the screen exploded with a bar chart covered with red lines swooping downward. “Not ideal, Sarah? That looks like a dumpster fire,” the head of the sales department said with a tight voice. “Please, John,” Dan broke in with a question, and without taking his eyes off Sarah, he drew his voice down to a dangerous level. “Let her talk.” Sarah drew a deep breath and went on, trying to ignore the blazing eyes that fixed her with their concentrated gaze. “The main reason for this decline is a change in consumer interest. The strategies we employed in the second quarter, which were very successful, no longer ring true with our customers.” “We think the problem is a lack of innovation and a failure to keep up with changing market conditions.” She hesitated, knowing what would come next. Dan’s knuckles were white on the table. A silence descended, and the sound of the fluorescent lights flickered overhead. Everyone waited, their teeth clenched, for what would come next from Dan. Their fate, and perhaps even that of the company, seemed to hang in the balance. The weight of the campaign’s failure hung in the air like a weighty, tangible presence, threatening to smother them all.",
        " Doctor Aris tensely adjusted his glasses, and the stern face of Dr. Lena Petrovich, imperturbable, with her pen on her clipboard, shrugged. The two scientists in white coats were staring at the central reservoir. “It’s... stable,” Aris whispered at last. In it the oily emerald-green liquid was slowly rolling, illuminated by the uv-lamps. The tank hummed, low and resonant, so that the bottom of the shoes vibrated. Lena Petrovich didn’t answer right away. She continued to watch the liquid and saw with her own eyes something rolling in it with a sort of slow and half-languid motion. “Or at least it seems so.” “Stable is an extremely charitable concept, Aris,” she suddenly remarked in a stern voice. “It is contained.” The substance was shapeless, a green blur, a bit like a fin, and a little like a pair of eyes, a kind of finger... Aris sighed and ran his hand through his already disheveled hair. “It is only contained for the time being, and only because we have put enough sedatives in it for a kraken.” “The readings are completely beyond the range of the instruments, Lena Petrovna. The energy level keeps fluctuating... we don’t know what it can do.” “Precisely,” Lena Petrovna agreed, closing her clipboard, “which is why we must move with extreme caution. The director demands results, and I understand that, but to push it too far could lead to catastrophe.” “Do you see? It’s responding to the uv light.” She pointed to a barely noticeable ripple on the surface of the liquid. “It’s adjusting to the uv.” The cold, sharp terror of this thought penetrated the previous unease of Aris. The concept of adjustment was clear to him. To adjust meant to learn, to grow, to increase.It meant...becoming something more than they had bargained for. \"The Director also wants to know if we can weaponize it,\" Aris said, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. Lena scoffed. \"Weaponize it? Aris, we barely understand what it *is*. We don't even know if it's alive, in the traditional sense. Weaponizing it is...insane.\" The thrumming of the tank intensified. The emerald fluid within churned more violently, the UV lights flickering ominously. \"Perhaps we should postpone the Director's request,\" Aris suggested, his voice trembling slightly. \"Until we have a better understanding of...\" Suddenly, the lights went out. The lab plunged into darkness, broken only by the faint, ethereal glow emanating from the containment tank. The thrumming reached a fever",
        " To spark off this kind of fun, he tried various subtle methods; a loose wire, a mushroom that had fallen into his hand, made his desire burn with a blaze; but this kind of subtlety was lost on his silly and stupid family; they ate the fungus and called him a great fiend, a thoughtful little boy, eating fungus. He imagined a grand fire, a blaze in the flames, with smoke piled high, like a glowing ember. Then he would scrounge for wood, for paper, for paper money, and wait for the moment. His relatives called him a liar and a madman. Now he longed for a grand fire, to set the whole house alight, from the roof to the front door. Then he would climb down from the roof with his tools, and this time, it would be a grand affair, a dram of liquor, a lullaby of a darker nature. One night, he crept down, so quietly that the creaking floorboards revealed his presence. A voice, from down the hall: “Is that you, Timmy? You are making a noise, aren’t you? Timmy, is that you?” Timmy’s mother was standing there, in her white nightgown, a troubled expression on her face, in the moonlight. “What are you doing, Timmy? I heard you yell, Timmy.” Timmy froze, his fate sealed; he could not confess, could not explain, that dark stain within, that murderous blemish. “It’s late,” she said, “we are so late.” Timmy’s mother sighed. “You are up so late, my dear, come and talk to me in the morning; go to your room.” She turned and walked away, frightened. He choked and spluttered, “I’m just... just going for a walk.” He stood alone, smelling the kerosene fumes, haunted by that dark and murderous memory. His plan was frustrated, the moment had passed; but his memory lingered.",
        " It was as if a figure carved out of granite had been seen in the setting sun. The glimmer of the setting sun danced around it, gilding the dust that was caught in its fiery embrace. The gleam of dust surrounded the man. The leather armor that covered him was worn, but it was well maintained. A long sword with a sinister look was slung on his hip. His eyes, the color of the storm, scanned the horizon. His horse was of an unusually large and powerful build, but it moved with a slow and graceful step. Its coat was the color of the ashes of a long fire; its mane and tail fanned like smoke in the wind. The man took a firm grip on the reins and the horse moved forward. As they climbed the heights, the world stretched before them: a vast plain with heat haze in the horizon. The air was heavy with the smell of dust and something sharper, a metallic smell, like blood. He spoke, his voice a deep rumble that barely echoed in the wind. He dismounted with an easy and fluid motion and stood still for a moment, listening. There was only the murmur of the wind that blew over the plain, but he thought he heard something else, a far cry, a plaintive sound. The horse, called Dust, snorted, pushed the ground impatiently with its hoof, and was apparently aware of what was happening. “Dust, there’s something wrong here,” he said. “Let’s go see what’s in store for us.” His voice sounded hard and urgent. The man unsheathed his sword. The steel whispered as it left its sheath, the last rays of the sun reflected in the edge of the blade. And he mounted on Dust.a touch of his heel, they descended into the gathering darkness, two figures silhouetted against the fading light, riding towards the unknown dangers that lurked in the heart of the plains. The hunt had begun.",
        " The comma crackled inaudibly over the roar of the entry. “Anything I need to know, Jax? I haven’t been to a planet for ages!” John shouted above the roar of re-entry. “Things have changed, John. The last time I was down here they were still debating whether synth-steak was actually steak.” Jax’s voice, hollow and distorted, cut through. “But that’s all over. Synth-steak’s so five hundred and sixty, it’s now all about bio-engineered lobster farms in the Gobi, and mandatory emotional support drones.” John grunted, buckling his safety harness. “And as for the air quality... well, you’ll want to keep your mask on. Level five warning, at least.” “Lobster farms in the Gobi? Sounds like a recipe for an eco-crisis to me. And emotional support drones? That’s just too much, even for me.” “Whatever happened to a stiff whisky and a stoic silence?” He glanced at the display panel, the heat-shield indicators glowing reassuring green. “Stiff upper lip? Forget it. With the Great Meltdown of twenty-eight eight the whole concept of ‘stiff upper lip’ has been completely discredited. People are much more... sensitive these days.” The turbulence intensified, rocking the shuttle like a toy. Jax paused, a note of uneasiness in his voice. “Oh, and one more thing, John. The surface... you know how things are, on the surface.” “Come on, Jax, out with it. We’re not talking tea-drinking here.” He braced himself, clenching his knuckles white on the control column. “Well, there’s... unrest. Pockets of resistance. They’re calling themselves the ‘Earthbound’.” “Earthbound, eh? Not overly fond of the aliens, that lot.” “The Authority, mainly. Sounds pretty bloody sweet, eh? What are they resisting?” They... They think the whole concept of a harmonious, global society is oppressive. They’re... a bit iffy on the whole ‘emotionally sensitive’ thing. They’re very, very passionate.” “Passionate, and armed?” “I’d say so, Jax. I wouldn’t want to go down there if there’s any violence.”, his voice grim. Jax sighed. \"Highly. They've got access to some old tech, stuff they dug up from the pre-Collapse era. And they're not afraid to use it.\" The shaking lessened as the shuttle dipped into the lower atmosphere. Below, through the flickering plasma, John could glimpse the ravaged landscape. He saw the skeletal remains of skyscrapers, the sprawling, shimmering domes of the Authority's controlled zones, and vast swathes of barren wasteland stretching to the horizon. \"Lovely,\" he muttered. \"Just lovely. So, I'm walking into a planet full of stressed-out citizens, bio-engineered crustaceans, and trigger-happy rebels. Remind me again why I volunteered for this mission?\" Jax chuckled weakly. \"Because you're the only",
        " He patted his pockets to see if he had a notepad and a pen. Then he sat in the carriage across from the woman’s house, making sure he had everything he needed for the night. A flask of black coffee, rich in aroma, sat in the passenger’s seat, on which it diffused a scent that mingled with his anxiety. He didn’t take pride in this; he was just trying to find out what had happened. He would have to be precise and attentive. The subtle nuances of her eyes, her slight changes in her ways – he had tried to dismiss them as nothing, the usual business worries or seasonal excitement, but they had not gone away, gnawing at him, and the feeling remained a distant whisper in the back of his mind. It was a little unnerving. He thought of her sitting on the sofa with a book, with the cat on her knees, and the lamp washed the lawn in a peaceful, golden glow. He focused on the house, a picture of domestic tranquillity. He looked at his watch. This was the image he longed for to be true. It was a comfortable, familiar image. He was sorry to lie to her, but he didn’t have the courage to say what he thought, not without proof. He had said he was working late, a lie that tasted like burning wood in his mouth. Eight forty-seven. He adjusted the rearview mirror and saw his own reflection. He was tired, his eyes were filled with worry. He needed to know for sure, one way or the other. He knew this was a risky business, an avalanche that could take him to ruin. But the other choice, to live with his doubts and suspicions, was unbearable. He had not slept well for several days. He froze, his heart pounding under his ribs. A black car pulled up across the street and parked a few houses away. A man got out and put on his coat, squinting at him. He strove to breathe, to calm down. Was he being watched? Did she suspect? He watched the man walk toward the house, farther down the street. It must be a neighbor, arriving home late.block, inserting a key and disappearing inside. Relief washed over him, weak and shaky. He took a long sip of coffee, the bitter liquid burning down his throat. He needed to stay focused. He needed to see this through. He needed to know the truth, no matter how painful it might be. The night was young, and the waiting had only just begun.",
        " At the dark nook a glance is cast: old shadows loom, frightened by the unknown. The same old darkness presses on; but a little light at the horizon—the promise of new life. And, deep within, the yearning of the spirit. A burning need to rise up and break out of this hole. Then a restless spirit starts to reason, and whispers of something else.",
        " Another night, another dead end. My notebook was a tomb of crossed-out notes and scribbled hypotheses, evidence of the wall I’d been banging my head against for weeks.... My tweed coat smelled of cheap coffee and old cigarettes. Another sip of coffee, bitter as ever, but at least the caffeine gave me a brief glimpse of clarity. Outside the window the city was just beginning to stir, its awakening was bleak, a discordant symphony of car horns and it was driving me out of my mind. Eleanor Vance, socialite, gone without a trace. This case... this damned case was killing me. The police thought she was just a runaway, a rich girl bored with her life, but I knew better. No ransom note, no sign of a struggle, she was just... gone. A restricted number buzzed in my ear, the telephone on my desk was ringing. Something was rotten in this gilded cage, something the police didn’t know, something I had to find. I hesitated, my finger on the button. It could be a wrong number, a practical joke or... something else. My gut tightened. I couldn’t stop... I couldn’t stop. My life, my relentless search for the truth, it was dragging me into the filth. I answered in a rasping voice, worn out by sleeplessness. ‘Hello?’ It was the only thing I could say.",
        " In the sudden silence the chitinous jaws of the creature crunched gently, in the air which was resounding with their cries. The multifaceted eyes of the Writing-Bee squinted with an intense and unnerving gaze. The air around them crackled with a feeble but strangely resonant energy, and the air vibrated in my teeth. “Your presence is... unsettling. Explain yourself!” the bees rumbled, a sibilant buzzing and whispering which seemed to pass through my ears and worm into my mind. I could feel it was more than arrogance, a disappointment, an ancient disappointment. I had been the disappointment of some ancient and incomprehensible standard. The weight of their gaze made it hard for me to breathe. “I... I did not mean to intrude...” I swallowed and waited, choking with a sense of guilt. The buzzing of the bees was growing louder. What could I possibly say to justify my existence before this creature? “I... just...” I began and stopped. Then, suddenly, I knew I had nothing to say to them. “I... just... What?” A being whose thoughts span millennia, whose intellect dwarfs your entire species. My mind was whirling, I had to say something, anything, to pacify this beast. Speak, or I shall find your continued existence... inefficient. But what? To reassure it that I was not a threat, not a nuisance, not a waste of space?",
        " The hallway was a mess, a bag of groceries lay half-empty on the floor, a rogue apple rolled out the door. Michelle twirled around in the hallway and looked apropos at her mother, who was pale with rage. Michelle swallowed, her stomach twisted nervously. Her mother's voice was constricted, with an ominous calm under the surface. - Out? where? she murmured, avoiding his eyes. Her mother's gaze ran along her ripped pants, her band shirt, her hastily applied eyeliner, “You look like you're going to a rock concert in the street.” It's almost eleven o'clock. - Friends? Which friends? – It's only... with friends... she stammered, holding on to her phone harder. Her mother's voice rose. - Which friends? Those you have not introduced me to, those so mysterious that they only exist at night? - Mom, come on... it's not that serious... – Michelle was scared... - It's not serious, you lied to me. - Mother advanced, her eyes shining. She made a gesture with her hand on the groceries that were still unpacked. - You told me that you were going to stay home to study for this history exam, I even cooked your favorite penne. – Mother replied, his rage rising. - I'm not snooping! – Michelle objected, her anger growing. - You're always on my case, you're always telling me what to do. I just... I needed to get out... - Mother, I'm your mother! it's my job to care for you, to lead you... I can't breathe! You don't have to breathe, Michelle, it's a matter of trust. And now I'm worried to death! Her mother's voice was torn slightly, his anger momentarily giving way to a wild, heartbroken feeling. It hurt her conscience. But the feeling of being stifled remained, she knew she was wrong.her mother's constant supervision was still a powerful force. \"Look, I'm sorry I lied,\" she said, her voice softer now. \"But I'm going. I need this. Can we just talk about it later?\" Her mother crossed her arms, a stubborn set to her jaw. \"No. You are not going anywhere. You lied, you disobeyed, and you are grounded. Go to your room.\" Michelle's carefully constructed calm shattered. \"Grounded? Seriously? You can't control me, Mom! I'm almost eighteen!\" \"And as long as you live under my roof, I can and I will,\" her mother said, her voice unwavering. \"Now,",
        " A feeling of the absence of legs, of feet, of shadows in this harsh, merciless light, made me feel as though I were an apparition. I looked down, but I saw nothing. I stretched out my hand, or rather, I tried to stretch out my hand. There was only a vague, uncomfortable void where my body should have been. A sense of panic clawed at my throat, a scream caught in my throat. Below me was the familiar, yet strange landscape. My hand, too, was gone. I felt a numb sensation, a sense of detachment. Everything was as I had left it, or rather, as I would have left it. My old apartment: the old worn rug that I had tripped over so many times, the table with the empty coffee cups and half-read books, the sun shining in through the dusty window. My landlady, Sara, was sitting on the sofa, her shoulders heaving. But I was not in the apartment. I was merely above it, detached, a silent observer. She was holding something pressed to her breast, some picture frame. I recognized that sob, that desperate, heart-rending cry. I would like to console her, to wipe away her tears, to console her. A surge of anguish, a mighty wave of pity, of love, of sorrow, came crashing down on me. A droll picture, a snapshot from a holiday party the previous summer. A chilly fear crept through my bones, or at least the place where my bones should have been. But I could not reach down to her, I was stuck in this void, separated by an invisible barrier, an unbridgeable abyss. Where was I? Am I dead? What had happened? A tremor in the abyss. My thoughts hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. A shadow, an immense shadow, stood before me, motionless, as though dead. I turned around, or rather, I tried to turn around. A flicker of awareness, a sensation of something moving, something just out of reach, something beyond my perception. Its face was hidden from me, but I could feel the stare, the inexorable pressure.on me. And suddenly, I know. I know that I am no longer alive. And I know, with a chilling certainty, that this is just the beginning.",
        " It was impossible to remember what I was watching. The slight buzz of the set, like a gentle rhythm, flitted about on my eyelids, in soft and rhythmic tune with the soft and slumbering sound of my heart. My perfect evening was to fall asleep in front of the box, the empty bag of French fries in my lap. An empty, slightly greasy bag of crumbs—each greasy bite having washed away the day’s anxieties in a soothing, artificially flavored soup. I had probably seen something comforting, something stupid and monotonous, the hundredth time I had seen it, the familiar friend of the silent solitude of my room. They had all been sent away into tomorrow. Shame? Guilt? The house was silent; there was only the box, a comforting machine, a tender blanket of solitude. There was nothing to be concerned about now, nothing. It was the pleasure of the intoxication of being sunk in a warm, tender space. A cat, a red-tinted cat called Marmalade, timidly touched my hand. My muscles were loose, relaxed; the tension that had been coiled and twisted in my shoulders during the day had uncoiled, and I was soft and heavy. He knew what to do: in this condition, this state of semi-sleep induced by the crumbs of fries, I could let him use me as his pillow. He uttered a deep rumble of a purr, vibrating through my arm. It was perhaps not the most useful way to spend an evening; perhaps I ought to be reading a book, doing something physical, arranging the basket of dirty laundry. He lay beside the empty bag, he would massage my blanket with his paws, a furry, snug, and contented little heap. This was my shelter, my ideal escape. But right now, right at this moment, with the softly buzzing lights of the set, the empty bag of fries, and the purring cat, I wouldn’t exchange it for anything. While the end of the show was being credited, I fell deeper into sleep, lulled by the rhythm of the box. This was... bliss.a peaceful, dreamless night.",
        " With each step that sluggishly dragged over the ruins of the ground a tolling metronome ticked, counting the seconds to my doom. The crowd encroached upon me, its numberless, enigmatic husks, shuffling forward, their cloaks of shadow. And the air thickened with dust, with decay, with a thick sweetish odor, which twisted my stomach. I felt my breath caught in my throat, like a caged bird that flutters against the bars. I could see their faces, or rather the ruins of them: the hollow eyes, the skin stretched tight over the bones, the mouths gaping with eternal silent screams. I could not comprehend how they could be alive, yet they moved with a horrible and solemn determination. My hand fell instinctively on the hilt of my sword, the cold blade bringing a certain coolness to my clammy palm. I wanted to scream, but my mouth slackened, making only a dry whistling noise. Fear made my legs a heavy lead. I had faced death before, I had seen it face to face, but this was different. But what good was one sword against a tide of the living dead? Hope was a fragile ember, which was about to be snuffed out by the surrounding darkness. The first husk had reached me; its emaciated fingers were already brushing my arm. This was not a heroic fight, not a sacrifice, but a consumption, an oblivion, a self-annihilation, a disintegration in the jaws of the insatiable, decomposing mass. Then a new sound came, a keening, high-pitched cry, which shook the ground beneath my feet. A tremor of icy terror passed through me, paralyzing my limbs. I closed my eyes, bracing myself for the cold embrace of death. I opened them. The shuffling had ceased. The stench was still there, but less thick, more faint.",
        " The air about me crackled with a dumb warning, with a palpable tension that even the most stupid could feel. They did not come to bother me. They dared not. Perhaps they had heard stories about me, perhaps they had felt something from my eyes, some glimmering of the past which they could not comprehend. Perhaps it was the way I carried myself, as a coiled spring ready to explode. Whatever it was, it did its work. They kept their distance, they avoided meeting my eyes. They had heard rumours about me in the shadows, about the things I had done, the limits I had crossed, the debts I had paid. It was as I liked it. I let them.",
        " It is worth noting that the word \"hacker\" itself is quite broad and covers a range of activities and intentions. The word \"hacker\" is used by everyone, and often contains several different meanings and connotations. It can mean someone who is a mysterious figure breaking into a government server, or someone who is simply very good at using technology in a different way. Hackers have also long been considered to be people who have a deep understanding of computer systems, but who also have a sense of exploration and play. Originally, these \"hackers\" were often programmers and engineers, and often sought to push the limits of what was possible. At MIT, where the railroad club once played with model trains using a control program, this was considered hacking. Using creativity and inventiveness, they solved problems, accelerated the speed of operation, or even built new systems. This meaning is generally considered to be a positive one, emphasizing the importance of technical skill, creativity, and passion for technology. Eventually, however, the word came to mean someone who maliciously exploits system faults, and this is the image most people have of a hacker. * This image of \"bad\" hackers is what most people think of when they hear the word \"hacker.\" These \"bad\" or \"black\" hackers, who may try to access a system without permission, are often motivated by financial gain, political gain, or even just by the desire to create chaos. In between these two types of hacker, there are also \"gray\" or \"half-black\" ones. In these cases, the hacker may find a way to enter a system by breaking it, and he may also try to take advantage of it for his own personal gain. On the other hand, a hacker can also be used in a much broader sense to describe someone who has a skill that goes beyond a simple understanding of a system. These \"hackers\" may also report security holes in a system to the company in charge of the system, and may even ask for a reward for their work.. For example, you might hear about \"life hacks\" or \"growth hacking,\" which refer to creative strategies for improving efficiency or achieving specific goals. * **Ethical Hacking (The Defenders):** Ethical hackers, also known as \"white hat\" hackers or penetration testers, are security professionals who use their hacking skills to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks with the permission of the owners. They simulate real-world attacks to help organizations strengthen their security posture and protect themselves from malicious actors. They are essential for cybersecurity and are often employed by companies, government agencies, and other organizations. * **Hacktivism (The Ideological Hackers):** This refers to hacking with a political or social agenda",
        " At first I thought it was only the low noise of a truck passing, the noise which is so common in this quarter, but it was still there. A slight tremor ran up my legs, and up my legs into my chest. I drew a quick breath. It was no truck. The air seemed to thicken, charged with a delicate energy which I could not catch. I glanced round the dusty shop, whose crowded shelves no longer seemed to me charming, but an avalanche of forgotten relics. This was different. This was something deliberate. I must say something. Would it be worth my while, when there was nothing to say? Madame Hawthorne, the owner, was singing softly behind the counter, quite unaware of the tremor. Madame Hawthorne stopped humming and looked up, frowning. The vibration increased, a cup trembled on the shelf above. Now I was sure it was not my imagination. ‘Did you feel that, my dear?’ she asked, in a rather tremulous voice. The cup trembled again, almost fell from the shelf. ‘Yes,’ I replied in a faint voice. ‘It’s... a vibration.’ Suddenly the lights went out, leaving the shop in darkness. Outside a dog began to bark frantically. The air was crackling with tension. We stared at each other, Madame Hawthorne’s eyes widened in a mixture of fear and curiosity. The lights came on again, and the vibration was over. A heavy silence descended, in which there was a strangeness. I did not know what it was, but one thing was sure, the vibration had left behind it an apprehension which was very real. ‘What was that?’ she breathed. I felt, I had a chilly certainty that it was not over.",
        " I stared at the pin, a little silver flag planted on the fleshy landscape of my hand. Blood bloomed in a slow, crimson bloom around the metal. The sharp sting ran up my arm, a little burning pulse of pain against the faint ache of my hand. A shaky breath escaped from my mouth, steaming the window panes in front of me. This was it. The last. I looked down at the other hand. The indifferent city lights were vague and indifferent outside, inside the small apartment seemed tight, heavy with phantoms of choices and words that never would be. What was I doing? On my hand were dozens of pins, small anchors, each a desperate hope. It was a pincushion, a grotesque mockery of a seamstress's tool. Is this a punishment? An affliction of twisted shape? The question rang in the silence unanswered. I do not know. I know only that I can not stop. To feel something, anything at all, in place of the hollow ache that was eating away at my heart. It was thick air in the room, charged with a strange and disturbing energy. My fingers trembled, they reached for the box, and the pins clicked softly against the cardboard. Not yet. The last pin. What then? I closed my eyes, and the pinched hand burned behind my eyelids. A sigh, I opened my eyes again and reached for the pin. Will it be a calm or only more pain? This time I hesitated. This time, instead of sticking it in my hand, I held it in my fingers, turned it round and round, the little head sparkling in the lamplight.",
        " “Well, shall we begin? What were we talking about before? To help me remember, please remind me, to help me to continue. The last topic. What was the last thing I said or did? What are you expecting of me? Write something? Analyze something? Or execute something?”",
        " George looked into the Petri dish, and the blue glimmer enveloping his face gave his face a strange appearance. It was a great chance that had stumbled upon this discovery: a supper whose sandwich had been forgotten, a rogue lamp and a mutinous Stratococcus mutans. This glimmering, bioluminescent matter, which he had provisionally named Dentibloom, was not a remover, but a remover, and more. It was not only a plaque remover, but a plaque remover, and more. A single application, he thought, could eliminate cavities forever. This was a colossal advance. He not only killed the bacteria, he also encouraged the growth of enamel, which he basically rubbed off. Children would no longer have to experience the fear of the drill. The billion-dollar toothpaste industry would be shaken up. Then, perhaps, dentists, the old keepers of oral hygiene, would be annihilated. But here's the moral dilemma that was driving him crazy, gnawing at him like a toothache: Dentibloom was not only a preventive measure, it also whitened the teeth, to a quite unnatural, almost 'cartoonish' white. George, the quiet, inconspicuous dental technician who dabbled in amateur microbiology, had inadvertently changed the future of dental hygiene. He had already observed, in early tests with extracted teeth, that prolonged exposure to Dentibloom caused a slight, yet unmistakable, hardening of the enamel, which made the teeth virtually indestructible. A Hollywood smile on steroids. Soldiers with teeth that could withstand explosions, athletes with jaws that could crush bones. Think of the possibilities! Imagine a world obsessed with an artificially white smile. Imagine a world where no one has a toothache that is unbearable. The waste and pollution caused by a substance that makes teeth virtually indestructible. George rubbed his eyes.already disheveled hair. He had the power to change the world, to eradicate a common source of suffering. But at what cost? Was he ready to unleash this Pandora’s Box of dental perfection upon humanity? He looked back at the glowing petri dish, the blue light reflecting in his troubled eyes. The future of dental hygiene, and perhaps much more, rested on his next decision. He had to choose. He had to decide what kind of legacy he wanted to leave. And he had to do it soon, before the world, and the bacteria in his own mouth, caught wind of Dentibloom.",
        " The greatest threat to humanity has never come from the sky or from one another, but from the slow, insidious corruption within. We have learned it long ago. It is said that the wonders and terrors of the universe lie in the deeps of space, but the real monsters are those that lie in the dark of our minds, stifling progress, destroying our own destinies. We erect walls of comfort around ourselves, one brick at a time, until we are buried in the dungeon of our own creation, too afraid to emerge, to invent, to live. We have to be our own enemies.",
        " There was a touch of mischief in her eyes, but her lips were always pressed into a line, a melancholy, but determined line. She was a pleasant woman, a bit difficult, but interesting. From one glance at her it was clear that she had seen and felt things that most people had never even read of. She wore her past like a comfortable coat, buttonless and worn to the shoulders. It was a strange mixture, a mute flame that attracted. She worked in the local library and knew where to find every book, every author, every obscure snippet of knowledge, which the high shelves were hiding. It was the right place for her, a sheltered place, where stories, both real and imaginary, would be able to provide her with consolation. One day a young man, barely out of his teens, came in, looking utterly lost and a little upset, and muttered that he needed a book, but what book, he did not know. And she knew instinctively which book to lend him, not just the one he was looking for. She handed him a little worn book, its cover all but gone. ‘ Try this,’ she said, and handed him the book. The young man followed her to a forgotten corner, where a high bookcase overflowed with poetry. ‘How did you know?’ he asked her, surprised. ‘Sometimes you can find what you need in someone else’s words.’ ‘I know,’ she said. She gave a knowing little smile, as if to suggest her past. And she left him to his reading and disappeared into the labyrinth of books, a guardian angel in a cardigan, ever watchful over the lost and the searching. ‘We all have our own stories inside us,’ she said. The trouble was that her story was still unwritten and partly unknown even to herself.",

        " The card shone with the dim light in my room, and I looked at the raised lettering. I lowered my mouth a little, not the sort of \"ah, that's interesting,\" but the sort of \"ah, that's dreadful\" kind. It was true. Or, at least, the card was true. \"Officially appointed by the Secret Ointment Factory of Victoria's Secret for foot oiling, sole de-embodying, and experienced booty-picker.\" I remembered the letter to the \"Victoria's Secret\" a year ago, and it was a pleasure to escape from the dreadful number of accounting. But now, what does it mean? What is the meaning of a lace dress and a leopard suit? It is only that I don't have any special skills, but I think that I am a qualified candidate for... I don't know what, but I put my heart and experience into the letter. I looked at the card again. \" Experienced boot oiler\" was kind of a big surprise, but it seemed to fit the company. I was also perfect. But the \"puppies' handler\"? Perhaps the demolition of the cradle is broken, and the disposal of old goods is done. I was suddenly stunned. The scene of the swarm of a small fluffy devil bursting into the \"Victoria's Secret\" and chewing on the lingerie and making the wings of the angels wet... It is. I wondered if I should pick up the phone, and I was in a hurry. I hesitated, and I picked up the phone and said, \"Hello.\" \"Is this... the official appointed by Victoria's Secret...\"Demolition ExpertPuppy Handler?\" I swallowed hard. \"...Speaking.\" \"Excellent.

We propose to use this method to jointly infer the latent states and learn the hyperparameters of the GP-SSM and the observation model. We show the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic and real-world data. We use the particle filter in the MC-PMC framework to efficiently approximate the intractable likelihood of the GP-SSM. Our results show an improvement of the inference compared to the alternative approximate inference methods, especially for noisy processes or with complex non-linear dynamics.",
        " The following paper is concerned with visual search under two settings, open and closed. In the closed-set setting, the search image is guaranteed to be from one of the classes of the image database. In contrast, the open-set setting requires a method which not only recognizes known classes but rejects unknown ones. We investigate methods [including a method of indexing and a learning procedure which emphasises the ability to reject unknown classes] in the open-set setting. We evaluate the performance of our method on a standard collection of images, both under the closed-set and the open-set settings, and show that the methods are successful in obtaining high retrieval accuracy, while rejecting unknown classes. The results illustrate the importance of taking into account the nature of the search when developing a system.",

We represent the evolving graph by a sequence of simplicial complexes, and define a kernel that estimates the similarity of complexes according to their structural properties. We use this kernel to estimate the distribution of higher order structures as a function of time. We present experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrating the ability of our method to detect subtle but important changes in the network.",

This paper introduces grid rcnn plus, a new version of grid rcnn, which has a significantly improved speed and accuracy. To achieve faster speed, we optimize the network structure and feature extraction. Specifically, we use a more efficient backbone and optimize the feature extraction network, which does not sacrifice the power of the model. To achieve better accuracy, we design a new method for improving the accuracy of the grid, which uses the spatial context of neighboring grids to refine the box. The results of the experiments on the COCO benchmark show that grid rcnn plus can achieve the best detection performance while achieving a faster inference speed than grid rcnn. The performance is more suitable for real-world object detection.",

The distances are learned in this way, and are then mapped back to the 3D points by a back-projection method. The distances between points are also taken into account, so that they remain accurate. The proposed method is compared to other methods by the method of ablation, where the authors are able to see the advantage of the projection and back-projection method.",

The paper examines the two basic goals of exploration: finding the best possible match with as few samples as possible and reducing the expected difference between the rewards the learner gets and the rewards the optimum match gets over a finite time. And it discusses the relationship between pure exploration and regret minimization in the match bandit setting, so that the learner can find the best way to allocate resources between exploration and exploitation. In addition, it provides the theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity and the regret of the proposed solutions. Our results also highlight the difficulty and potential of the combinatorial structure of the matching problem, and they establish a basis for efficient learning in this new bandit framework.",

With the growing adoption of complex models, it is essential to understand their decision-making processes, so as to build trust, to ensure fairness and to allow effective debugging. InterpretML addresses this need by providing a unified API to interpretability techniques that cover both model-agnostic and model-dependent methods. In addition to making it easy to apply and compare different interpretability methods, the framework also includes visualisation tools to help the user understand and communicate model insights. InterpretML also enables the generation of global and local explanations, which provide insight into the importance of features, model behaviour and potential biases. The present paper provides an overview of the key features and aims of InterpretML and demonstrates how it can be a valuable resource for promoting interpretable machine learning practices.",

The joint of these four sections was the train. The rods, welded together by the fusion, were removed from the molten mass. A new wave of welds were thus prepared, and they had to be done without a break during the course of the day, to meet a railway connection, which had been arranged at a suitable point of the tracks. A class of these locomotives was very rare, and, because of their number, if we found one it was very rare. In this paper, we propose a new placement technique based on reinforcement learning that can improve the performance of the wire length and congestion. The results of our experiments show that the proposed placement method can achieve significant wire length and congestion reductions compared with other placement methods, which is a promising direction for automatic and intelligent design optimization.",

The result shows that PSDMF can make good use of the unlabeled data and take full advantage of the multi-view information, so that the accuracy of the prediction is higher, and the prediction is more robust. Its value is especially prominent in the case where the views are asymmetrically correlated and relevant to the task. The performance of PSDMF is significantly higher than that of the existing semi-supervised learning and multi-view learning methods.",

This paper presents a new way of learning goals directly from data, which allows robots to reason about plausible futures without a predetermined goal. We show in a simulated environment that the robot can learn to generate diverse and relevant goals that lead to improved planning performance and robustness compared to methods relying on predefined goals. The robot learns a latent space of goals that is conditioned on the initial state of the environment, and then it uses the learned goals to sample from this space to construct plans for reaching these goals. Our results show that learning to generate goals is a promising way to enable robots to solve complex tasks in unstructured environments.",

We also investigate the effect of various convex formulations and constraints on the quality and robustness of the generated adversarial examples. The insights derived from our work deepen our understanding of adversarial attacks and make our method a useful tool for evaluating and defending against model misclassifications.",

The work deals with the theoretical properties of the Lasso estimator for time series estimation under realistic conditions. We provide explicit expressions for the speed of convergence of the estimator, which depend on the level of sparsity, the mixing coefficient and the nature of the noise. These theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations which show that the Lasso can estimate the true underlying model with high probability even in the presence of noise and the serial correlation, provided the mixing coefficient decays quickly enough.",

        " Now the GAN model is often able to recover with great success images downsampled at low resolutions. But there is no understanding of the degree to which the reconstruction of such important details is possible with the GAN model. This work proposes a novel method for evaluating the performance of GANs specifically designed for the surveillance of the images of the lower resolution. Our method, called zooming, enlarging!, consists in systematically downsampling high-resolution surveillance images, in applying various GAN-based upsampling methods to these images, and in evaluating the resultant images using task-related metrics.. We propose a set of metrics, based on measures of image quality such as PSNR and SSIM, but focusing on the fidelity of features relevant to surveillance tasks, such as face recognition and object recognition. The results provide a useful perspective on the practical limitations of the current GAN-based upsampling methods for surveillance tasks and suggest avenues for future research to improve the applicability of these methods in the real world. We present a comparative analysis of several state-of-the-art GAN architectures, revealing their strengths and weaknesses in the task of recovering key features from severely downsampled surveillance images.",

The goal of this process is to obtain an estimation of the illuminant from a single image and correct for its effects, thus recovering the true colors of the objects. This paper illustrates the potential of probabilistic approaches for the development of the color constancy field by providing a principled framework for uncertainty modeling and the illuminant estimation. This leads to more accurate illuminant estimation, especially in difficult situations with changing lighting, complex scene content, and insufficient prior information.",
        " A new method for detecting the presence of dementia by means of a three-dimensional convolutional neural network has been devised in the present paper, the brain morphology of which, as a prelude to its eventual clinical examination, is analyzed. The spatial characterization of the brain has been based on the observations that the voxels, in which the objects were classified, were discoloured, viz. These voxels are non-neural tissue, in which the so-called brain material is located, which cannot be assigned to any particular region, thus forming a complete neural tissue. The result is superior to those obtained by the aforementioned hand-made and two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) methods, and proves the efficacy of the learning of the high-level representations of the brain region affected by dementia by means of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks. A potential is thus outlined of the development of a more accurate means of diagnosing dementia and thereby improving the outcome of the disease.",

These sparse DAGs achieve the same or higher classification accuracy as state-of-the-art methods with much smaller models and inference times, and thus are particularly suitable for resource-limited settings and rapid classification applications. Using a regularized method, we learn the DAG topology and node weights simultaneously, and we attempt to minimize the error rate simultaneously.",

We are testing this method on real data and demonstrate its ability to predict the occurrence of a disease, to discover the dynamic relationships between diseases, and to learn from individual patient data the commutation of diseases in time. These individual, commutational, comorbidity-networks give us a better understanding of the risks of each individual and can lead to more individualized treatment strategies.",

Finally, the study enables the development of an automatic fish recognition system, useful in aquaculture, fisheries management and in the conservation of aquatic life.",

This is known as the automatic neural network design method. It has been proven in experiments on a number of well-known data sets. The performance of the discovered graph neural network is better than that of the best known hand-designed graph neural network.",

Our method is based on the observation that different architectures often share common extraction units. The time to train a given candidate architecture is therefore drastically reduced, and the exploration of the design space of architectures can be significantly increased. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a broad set of object detection problems, achieving significant speedups without sacrificing accuracy. We further explore the potential of our shared representation beyond architecture search and show its effectiveness for transfer learning and domain adaptation.",

This paper addresses the problem of decomposing surveillance videos into events without relying on the costly and labor-intense task of frame-level annotation. Our framework is shown to be effective in [experimental evaluation on data set], achieving high performance and comparable results to those requiring a much larger amount of supervision, thereby highlighting the usefulness of this approach for real-world applications. We also analyze the effect of various frame selection strategies and the potential future developments of single-frame supervision.",
        " But to deduce and describe the complicated phenomena of the heart is difficult, besides which it requires much experience and much labor. But to approach the problem, by the other method of learning by analogy, the neural nets are suited. The neural net is also suited for the heart, in which it can be connected to the simple physiological and morphological description of the heart. We use the so-called neural FMU, the framework of which permits us to converge in a unitary fashion the simple physico-physiological and the data-driven parts of the heart, and thus to predict the behavior of the heart as a whole. The hybrid method thus offers a new way to build individualized heart models with increased predictive power and reduced complexity. We demonstrate the potential of this method by simulation, showing improved accuracy compared to purely mechanistic models, while maintaining interpretability and allowing fast exploration of different physiological circumstances.",
        " In time-series prediction, which is a vital problem in many areas, we introduce a new method for the modeling of temporal dependencies. This method uses a dynamic graph of states to model complex temporal dependencies and to predict future events. This graph is based on an evolutionary mechanism, which allows nodes and edges to be added, removed, or merged depending on the frequency of events and the probabilities of transitions. The resulting graph evolves over time, adapting to new patterns of events and maintaining the structure of the long-term dependencies. We also develop a time-series prediction method that uses this dynamic graph of states to estimate the probabilities of future events based on the current state of the system and on past patterns of events. In our experiments, the new method performs better than previous methods in both the accuracy of predictions and in the robustness of its solutions.",
        " High-dimensional monitoring methods usually have difficulty with high-dimensional data and non-linear relations. We use the ability of deep probabilistic autoencoders to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of profiles to capture the key nonlinear features. These profiles can then be used to estimate the reconstruction probability of new profiles, thereby enabling more robust and accurate detection of shifts than methods that rely on a distance measure between samples. We use this approach in simulations and real-world experiments to show that the deep probabilistic autoencoder can be a powerful tool for monitoring complex and subtle shifts in a high-dimensional nonlinear environment. A new technique, a probabilistic regression tree, is proposed.",
        " Our system is the most versatile in learning features from the initial data, based on reinforcement learning. Unlike previous methods, which require a hand-crafted loss function or proxy tasks, the DISK method formulates the learning of features as a sequential decision process. We show that DISK learns task-related, robust local features that outperform existing hand-crafted and learned features in challenging tasks. A policy agent, represented by a neural network, learns the policy of selecting keypoints and generating corresponding descriptors. The policy is directly trained on a subsequent task, such as image matching or visual localization, by policy gradient methods. It is easy to adapt to a variety of tasks. Moreover, we believe that learning from a local policy with a given task could lead to more intelligent and flexible features.",
        " The design we have adopted uses a Bi-GAN architecture, the generator upscales the low-resolution input and the encoder maps the generated high-resolution image back into the latent space to achieve consistency between the generated and real high-resolution distributions. We propose a new method for perceptual image super-resolution based on the combination of two generative models, Bi-GANs and Spatial Transformers (ST). Compared with existing works, our method can restore a higher resolution image, the sharpness and texture are more realistic, and the details are closer to the original image. In order to further improve the perceptual quality of the generated high-resolution image, we adopt STs in the generator, which can better refine the selected details and enhance the network’s ability to recover fine details and reduce artifacts.",

The Villa is a very elegant one, built with fine materials, furnished with every luxury, and enclosed in a charming park, of which there are two entrances: a Gothic one with a small courtyard, with a portico and an annex; a second annex and a larger annexe are entirely dedicated to the higher-class data, which require a smaller communication. The windows are of the French style, pierced with oval panes, in which the columns, which give the buildings a solid aspect, are inlaid with the usual hand-carved stone. This data structure makes it possible to realize a very complex and finished arrangement, in which, if the proportions of the members are preserved, one can observe a very correct harmony of the spaces, very solid outlines and well-proportioned proportions of colors, a lot of transparency and light, a powerful interplay of light, etc.... In this paper, we analyze the convergence properties of our proposed network, and prove that it converges at a rate corresponding to the [name of the regime] convergence of the standard SGD under the following conditions: (for example: smoothness and convexity of the weights, convexity and smoothness of the gradients, but also convergence in a given period, e.g. a fixed-parameter distribution. There are many results that can be cited to show the effectiveness of sketching in communication-efficient distributed training of large-scale machine-learning models.",
        " 'Stepwise regression,' said he, 'which is a well-known technique for the selection of features and for the elaboration of models, can be adapted to unsupervised learning problems. In the paper under consideration, we present a novel framework which uses the principles of stepwise regression to find the important features of unlabeled data.' This method has been tried on several data sets, both synthetic and real, and has proved to be a valuable aid in the selection of features, both for the enhancement of the performance of the classifiers and for the discovery of their hidden structures.",
        " Abstention, or selective classification, is a useful tool for reducing the overall error rate by avoiding incorrect predictions; but a nave implementation of abstention can exacerbate existing biases if certain groups are disproportionately more likely to be abstained from. This paper addresses the problem of building classification models that can abstain from making predictions when they are uncertain, while ensuring fairness across different demographic groups. We introduce a model to optimize the classification parameters in order to balance these conflicting goals and show that it can successfully perform in real-world data. This paper contributes to the growing field of fair machine learning by providing a practical and effective method for building classification models that are both fair and accurate. Our experiments show that our approach significantly reduces disparities in abstention and error rates over and above the performance of naive implementations.",
        " The time-space block and long-short-term memory (STB-LSTM) neural network is proposed in this paper for predicting the future pedestrian trajectory. The spatial relationship between pedestrians and the temporal sequences within each pedestrian's trajectory must be captured in order to accurately predict the future path of pedestrians. The STB-LSTM network first uses a spatial-temporal block to learn the spatial-temporal sequence of pedestrians in consecutive frames, which can model the spatial relationship between pedestrians, and then applies a long short-term memory network to learn the temporal sequence of each pedestrian, and finally predicts the future path of each pedestrian. This paper uses two large-scale data sets to conduct experiments on the accuracy and robustness of the proposed STB-LSTM network.",
        " This is the first sentence in the paper: Gated-Segmentation Convolutional Neural Networks (Gated-SCNNs) are the novel architecture of our paper that explicitly includes the shape information in the segmentation. Convolutional Neural Nets have shown great success in semantic segmentation, but they have had some difficulties in correctly recognizing the boundaries of objects and complex shapes. The proposed Gated-SCNN module dynamically controls the semantic convolution of the semantic convolution by the edge information in the shape convolution. The main convolution is on the semantic feature, and the secondary convolution is on the shape feature. This means that the network can selectively emphasize the shape feature in the decomposition of objects, and the accuracy of segmentation will be greatly improved, especially at the boundaries. This architecture provides a robust and efficient way to include shape information, and the resulting results are more accurate and visually appealing. We have tested it on challenging semantic segmentation data, and the results are significantly better than other state-of-the-art methods, especially for object boundaries and shapes.",
        " Object detection methods, while having reached a high level of performance, have yet to overcome many real-world problems. This paper examines the real-world limits of object detection methods, highlighting the major sources of error, the bounding box sizes that can be expected from these bounding boxes, and the invariance properties of these bounding boxes. We then use this information to formulate a set of recommendations to improve the performance of object detection methods, by focusing on the deficiencies of the existing methods, but also exploiting their potential. We first conduct a detailed error analysis of popular object detection methods, categorizing their errors as localization errors, classification errors, and background interference errors. The specific weaknesses of different architectures are thus uncovered. Finally, we analyze the invariance properties of these methods to common data corruptions and transformations, highlighting their invariance properties and the lack of invariance properties.",
        " GNNs have demonstrated remarkable success in learning with network data, but their performance can be limited by the initial feature set of the nodes and the local neighborhood information captured during the forward propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the quality of the input to GNNs by using the information from random walks on the network. In particular, we show on various network datasets that, by combining random walks and the original features of the nodes, the random walk-augmented input can overcome the information gap between the local and global features. This approach provides a simple but effective way to enrich the input to GNNs and thus improve their ability to learn with complex graph structures. We show that RaWaNet consistently improves the performance of various GNN architectures and highlights the benefit of integrating the global structural information obtained from random walks.",
        " This work explores the potential for learning molecular representations from large, unlabelled, unannotated molecular datasets, using the power of unsupervised learning. It is hypothesized that training on a vast amount of unannotated chemical data makes it possible to learn the structural and functional relationships in the molecules in a more robust way, and that the representations are therefore more generic and robust. By reducing the computations needed to train the network to a minimum, it is possible to obtain a large number of molecules with accurately predicted properties. These molecules are then used in drug discovery tasks, such as [e.g. virtual screening, property prediction, target identification]. Our results show that the use of a large unlabelled training set provides significant improvements over supervised learning. We then evaluate these learned representations on other downstream drug discovery tasks, such as [e.g. virtual screening, property prediction, target identification][18].",

It tackles the challenge of data sparsity, modality difference and domain transfer by bringing the semantic information of the point cloud into the process of image generation. It is expected to have a significant application in the field of virtual reality, robotics, and self-driving vehicles, in terms of its ability to provide a realistic and meaningful image representation of Lidar data. It uses a GAN method with a semantic consistency loss function that aligns images generated by the GAN with the semantic information of the point cloud. Then it is proven with quantitative and qualitative evaluations that it is able to generate high-quality images with high semantic consistency.",

It provides a useful resource for the training and testing of place-recognition systems for the most challenging of real-world environments. We illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of different methods by means of accuracy and robustness to variations in the environment. Finally, we present a comparison of the performance of several visual representation learning methods, including hand-crafted features and deep-learning-based methods, on the problem of place recognition in gardens. This data-set and its evaluation results are publicly available to facilitate further research in this area.",

We introduce a formal method for the representation of such sets, and focus on the main problem of learning their internal structure from small samples. Various methods are described, based on permutation groups and on the theory of representations. It is shown that they can give an improvement over the methods used in the previous state of the art. Moreover, they are demonstrated in practice by experiments on synthetic and real data, showing that they are able to learn more symmetrically arranged classes, and outperform general classifiers.",
        " In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning approach to the efficient generation of high-resolution RGB-D images with enhanced realism. The network receptive field is dynamically adjusted on the local image characteristics and depth information. Nevertheless, the problem of generating high-resolution 3D images remains a difficult task, which is complicated by the difficulties of realistically simulating the real depth and the relationships between the depth and the color. Experimental results on the NIPS and CIVR 2015 datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating realistic and coherent RGB-D images. It also generates the highest quality and realism in the two channels. Our model is shown to be faster than existing methods and is still able to achieve the highest quality.",
        " For the identification of the most profitable stocks, a novel financial graph attention network (GAT) model is proposed. This model uses graph structures to represent the interdependencies between stocks, combining both static relationships from company profiles and dynamic relationships from time series data. And the structure of the attention mechanism enables a flexible and fast learning of weights for the nodes of the graph, which allows them to reflect the importance of their neighbours and the full complexity of the market. The FinGAT model is evaluated on historical stock market data, and shows better performance than conventional methods in identifying stocks with high future return potential.",
        " By the simple method of defining the direction, velocity and posture, we define the envelopes, and extract the envelopes of locomotion, as well as the more important features of locomotion, such as the dominant direction, the velocity profile and the postural configuration. Rather than relying on the precise quantification of locomotion, this method focuses on the characterization of certain quality regions of movement, called locomotion envelopes, and the relationship between these regions of movement, through a process of coregionalization. This analysis is more intuitive, more comprehensible, and makes it easier to find basic principles and deviations in locomotion. We illustrate this approach with several examples, indicating its potential for application to the study of the movement of robots, biomechanics and clinical analysis of locomotion.",
        " THE REASON FOR OUR PRESENTING DuPLO, A DUal Viewpoint Deep Learning Architecture for Time-series Classification, TO MAKE THE TIME-SERIES CLASSIFICATION PROCESS MORE COMPLETE, AND TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEXITY OF TIME-SERIES CLASSIFICATION, IS TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEXITY OF TIME-SERIES BY USING A DUaL VIEWPOINT DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE WHERE THE DEEP LIGHT PIPELS TO EACH OTHER, AND TO THE COMMANDS OF OUR END OTHERS, TO LEARN AND APPLY THEM TO OUR WORK AND OUR HELP THEM TO USE THEM VERY WELL, AND WITH THE INDIVIDUALITY OF EACH OF THEM TO GIVE THEM ALL THEIR CERTAIN PROPERTYPETE TO THEM WITHOUT THEMOST EXPERTLY SCHOOLECASTICE WHICH HAS YETTE THEM MADE OF DATE, AND TO LEARN TO GIVE THEM ITS DESCRIPE PLURY AND TO DEVELOP THEIR ENTITIES. LET THEM USE THEM WITH THE UNDERSTANDINGS. Our architecture uses two deep learning networks in one network and combines the outputs of these two networks by using attention mechanisms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dual-viewpoint approach in capturing complementary information and improving the accuracy and robustness of time-series classification. We evaluated our system on a diverse set of public time-series classification data-sets and found it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness.",
        " In reinforcement learning, one of the great difficulties is the problem of learning good representations for the environment, which enable efficient goal pursuit. In this paper, a new representation learning method, based on variational reversibility, is proposed. We introduce a variational lower bound for reversibility which enables us to learn a representation, which captures the possibility of going to various states. The resulting representation includes information about the states and the control. This leads to a faster learning and better results for agents that are trained with this method, indicating the advantages of explicitly learning representations which capture control capabilities. We show with an empirical study that this method learns effective representations and thereby improves the performance of goal-directed reinforcement learning.",
        " We have developed a new metric for the assessment of the quality of reconstructed 3D models, which is inferred from the geometric consistency, structural integrity, and topological correctness of the reconstructed model. Unlike the existing metrics which rely on the comparison of the reconstructed model with a known correct model, this is impractical or impossible in many real-world applications. Our metric combines these features into a single score that can be used to estimate the quality of the reconstruction, without any reference model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metric by evaluating the performance of several 3D reconstruction and mapping methods on both synthetic and real-world data, illustrating its ability to differentiate between successful and failed reconstructions, and providing useful information to optimize the method. A general and robust approach for the evaluation of 3D reconstruction and mapping methods in situations where ground truth information is not available is presented.",
        " And then they will again rise up and show you the last episode and the end of the book. This paper presents a new method for generating image assemblages which it is proposed to call Transform the Set, and which is designed to produce assemblages in the guided as well as the unguided mode. Its method is based on a method of memory and selection, in which a memory module retains and recalls the previous arrangements of the images. In the guided mode, the memory assists the reselection of images to fill a certain input pattern, and in the unguided mode, it finds harmonious arrangements according to a pattern which has been learned. In both modes, this memory allows the model to learn complex compositional rules and to produce consistent and aesthetically pleasing arrangements. Our method represents an important step forward in generating high-quality assemblages with greater artistic merit and greater control by the user. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.",
        " The heterogeneous inference problem is a challenging one. It is complicated by the need to accurately represent and relate various kinds of information. In this paper we propose a novel generative model that is capable of learning a latent space capable of representing the fundamental relationships between the heterogeneous data sources. In addition, our model is able to effectively generate plausible images of missing or incomplete data, enabling robust inferences even in the presence of noisy and sparse data. We compare our model to existing methods on a variety of different tasks and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy and robustness. The underlying representations are designed to be flexible, enabling our model to be used for various kinds of data, while the latent space enables knowledge transfer and cross-modal reasoning.",
        " The paper proposes ViTAE, a new vision transformer, whose goal is to improve the performance of ViTs by revealing and exploiting their inherent inductive biases. The new system was developed on the basis of the idea that vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved a number of successes in various computer vision tasks, largely because they have had access to very large data sets; However, the inductive biases that are essential for generalization and sample efficiency are not found in them, especially when there is a limited data set or a complex visual structure. In particular, we use [this brief list of tools, e.g., a new attention mechanism, a specific architecture, etc. ] to evoke the biases and learn more robust and generalizable representations, resulting in a significant improvement in performance on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. ViTAE reaches state-of-the-art accuracy, and sample efficiency and robustness are improved compared to existing ViT variants, highlighting the importance of explicitly implementing inductive biases in Vision Transformer architectures.",
        " It is a different and different approach to find the nearest instances which are the same as the instances with which it deals. It is a counter-factual method. It is a kind of a method of learning instances. It has the advantage of identifying the nearest neighbors to the cases and then, within this limited area, optimizes the counter-fact for the neighboring set of examples. The counter-factuals are more similar to the query cases, more plausible, more diverse, than the counter-factuals produced by the methods in the state of the art. We show in experiments on the standard set that the counter-factuals are closer to the instances with which it deals, more plausible and diverse than the methods of the state of the art. The quality of the explanations is also comparable or better than in the state-of-the-art. But the new method has a different advantage on the test set.",
        " “Existing crowd-counting datasets often suffer from deficiencies in size, density, and annotation quality that prevent the development of robust, generalizable models. We present the large-scale, crowd-counting-specific dataset NNPU-Crowd, which addresses these shortcomings by presenting more than 5,000 images with over two million heads. We annotate each head with a dense set of points, facilitating both crowd density estimation and individual-person localization. The dataset is very diverse with respect to scene type, crowd density (ranging from sparse to extremely dense), and image resolution. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of several recent crowd-counting and crowd-counting methods on NNPU-Crowd to provide a starting point for future research.” The NNPU-Crowd data and the code used for evaluation are available to the research community. Our experiments demonstrate the crowd-counting challenge that this new dataset presents, and demonstrate the potential for it to motivate further developments in crowd-counting algorithms.",
        " Finally, because evaluation based only on accuracy tends to ignore important aspects, such as the interpretability of the model and the logic of the predicted decision, our framework addresses this issue by combining quantitative metrics with qualitative explainability measures. The framework includes a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure, together with explainability measures, which quantify the importance of features, the transparency of the decision, and the fidelity of the justification. It is demonstrated that the framework is applicable to a number of well-known multivariate time-series classifiers, and that there is a trade-off between performance and explainability. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of classifier behaviour, which will assist in the development of more reliable and transparent machine-learning solutions for time-series analysis. The results are valuable for the selection of classifiers appropriate to a given application where accuracy and interpretability are paramount.",
        " The paper deals with the effect of momentum, a very frequently used optimization technique, and we argue that, while accelerating the convergence of the model on balanced data, momentum will, by its own nature, accentuate the bias in favour of classes at the top of the scale. The class of a few samples is very influential in the training of a learning machine, whereas the rest is ill represented. Then, in a way to remove the bad by limiting the contribution of momentum to the head classes, the result is to keep the good and reduce the influence of the bias. To do this, we propose a new method, based on the frequency of classes, for selectively modifying the momentum value. In practice, on the large data sets of the laboratory, it is demonstrated that our method achieves, by a good balance of the learning, the best results known to date, which can be said to be \"in the art\". The momentum we propose is called a moment of causality, the basic principle of which is that for each sample we modify, on the fly, the coefficient of momentum, according to the frequency of the class in which the sample belongs.",
        " We propose a new distributed reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, where vehicles act as their own agents and optimize their behavior for carpooling, without the need for a centralized controller or a complete model of the environment. We introduce a distributed reward that incentivizes agents to join the route of the vehicle and enables multi-hop routing, while balancing individual benefits and system-level efficiency. Each agent has a deep neural network that approximates the Q function locally, which makes it possible to use information from local observations and limited communication with neighboring vehicles to decide its actions. We demonstrate in simulations that our distributed DRL framework achieves substantial improvements in passenger waiting times, in vehicle use and in the overall system efficiency, compared to the local DRL solutions. Our results highlight the potential of decentralized reinforcement learning for solving complex optimization problems in dynamic and uncertain transportation systems.",
        " Precise predictions of patient outcomes are crucial for improving health care delivery and resource allocation. The complex relationships between patients, diseases and treatments are poorly modeled by many methods. In this paper, we explore the use of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) to model patient outcomes by encoding their graph structure. We build a heterogeneous graph encompassing patients, diagnoses, treatments and their interactions, and then use GRL to learn a low-dimensional representation of the dependencies in the graph. This representation is then used as a feature in subsequent classification or regression models to predict outcomes such as death, readmission or disease progression. We show that, on a clinical dataset, GRL outperforms traditional methods.",
        " EXPLORING INTEGRATED PERFORMANCE IMPACTS TO MONOCULAR VEHICLE POISITION EXPERIMENT Monocular vehicle position estimation, the task of predicting a vehicle's 3D position from a single image, is still a difficult problem due to the lack of depth information. In this paper, we will examine the effect of different intermediate representations on the performance of monocular vehicle pose estimation. We use different intermediate representations, such as 3D points, 3D bounding boxes, and dense depth maps, as intermediate layers of a deep learning pipeline. Experiments on a publicly available dataset show the strengths and weaknesses of each representation, and show that there is a clear trade-off between accuracy, robustness and computation. This study can help in the design of a good monocular vehicle position estimation system, because it can help us understand the importance of choosing a suitable intermediate representation to bridge the gap between 2D features and 3D positions.",
        " Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a variety of vision tasks, but they are too expensive to train, and their memory requirements often prevent their deployment on resource-constrained devices. A low-rank approximation technique can help to compress the computations by decomposing the weight tensor into lower-dimensional sub-tensors. In this paper, we present a new approach to learning the low-rank approximation directly during the training. We introduce a differentiable parameterization for the low-rank tensor and propose a joint optimization method that optimizes the weights and the low-rank tensor simultaneously. Experimental results on the Benchmarking datasets show that our method achieves substantial compression with little degradation in accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. The method can be more efficiently and effectively deployed on resource-constrained platforms by learning a task-dependent low-rank tensor during the training.",

        " The objective of this paper is to develop a method for the generation of images according to the conditions given. The method is based on a generative network, and two projection discriminators are employed: one projects the generating image into the image space, to make the image more consistent with the given conditions; the other projects the original image into the latent space, to force the generator to learn a more disentangling and controllable latent representation. These are all tested in extensive experiments on the generation of images under conditions, including text-to-image synthesis and image-to-image translation. Both in terms of quality and quantity, DP-GAN outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in generating images according to the conditions.",
        " This paper proposes a new approach to modeling synonymous referring expressions (REs) that exploits the features of their difference and similarity. Rather than focusing on the characteristics of each of the individual words, the relations between them in context are modeled. We develop a model that learns to represent REs and their contexts, including both individual and contrastive features. Experimental results on [The Dataset Name, if known, or for example, a corpus of referring expressions] show that the contrastive feature-based model outperforms existing methods in predicting the preferred RE. Our results provide insights into the factors influencing the choice of referring expressions, and also offer a promising direction for improving the performance of referring expression generation and resolution systems.",
        " And outliers have been treated as a good thing to be used for the identification of other things, like outliers. The use of the in-segment training is a problem that has recently been questioned. This paper investigates the degree to which pre-trained, general-purpose, and potentially in-segment, general-purpose, representations can be used for outlier detection, without explicit in-segment training. We test the hypothesis that these representations have rich semantic and structural information, which can be a strong basis for the identification of outliers, and which can reduce the need for expensive and time-consuming in-segment training. We test various outlier detection methods with both in-segment and pre-trained representations, and compare their performance in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. Our experiments show that, while the in-segment representations outperform the pre-trained ones, the use of pre-trained representations leads to an increase in the detection accuracy of a factor of two, but reduce the accuracy of detection by a factor of three. The results of our experiments shed light on the trade-off between in-segment adaptation and the use of pre-trained knowledge for outlier detection, and provide valuable insights into the applicability and limitations of each approach.",
        " Presently, a considerable amount of progress has been made in the recovery of the human form in three dimensions from two dimensions, and while the reconstruction of the human form from two dimensions has been much improved, errors in the establishment of its pose often lead to distortion or non-realistic reconstructions. A new method for establishing the pose of a three-dimensional figure, the purpose of which is to be found in the present communication, is the post-calendar of a time of image. Consequently, by calibrating the pose before the deformation of the mesh, we show that the realism of the resulting mesh is greatly improved. A learned calibration method is used to adjust the initial pose, which is dynamically adjusted by the context of the image. This post-calendar is designed to detect and correct common errors in pose, such as joint angle biases and limb lengths. Our approach is a robust and effective way of recovering the human form in three dimensions from two dimensions. We present a series of experiments on standard test data, showing that our method outperforms other methods in difficult situations such as occlusion, complex pose and noisy detection.",

It combines the advantages of a latent space representation and a bootstrap mechanism, whereby different latent representations are learned for each task during the training process. It also learns predictive models in the latent space, which allow for efficient policy learning and exploration. This process promotes the representation to be disentangled and robust, thus promoting generalization to new and unseen tasks. BLPR has been tested on a series of MTRL problems, and shows significant improvements over the best existing state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of bootstrapping latent representations and using predictions to achieve effective generalization in MTRL.",

        " This paper proposes a new method for the identification of the vehicle by the image, which is to be used in intelligent transportation systems. It consists of a combination of two parts: the attention mechanism and the meta-information ranking. In this paper, the spatial attention and the channel attention are used to enhance the image feature and to improve the discrimination ability. Then, we use the meta-information ranking method to correct the ranking results of the image features. The meta-information ranking is a kind of combined ranking method that uses the meta-information of the vehicle, such as the vehicle type and the vehicle color, to adjust the ranking list of the image features, and the ambiguity between the visual similarities of different vehicles can be eliminated. The method has the characteristics of being able to distinguish between similar vehicles and showing the advantages of combining meta-information and attention. Experiments on the CNVR test set show that the proposed method can achieve the best performance, and the combination of meta-information and attention can obtain the high accuracy of vehicle identification.",

Among the existing methods, the geometric relationships among the points are not captured, and the geometric relationships between the points cannot be shared, and this paper proposes a novel geometry-sharing network. It introduces a new loss function to encourage the network to learn the geometric features of the points. Using a shared geometric feature extraction node to learn local and global geometric features, and then using this shared representation as the input of task-special nodes to classify and separate, the performance of classification and separation is greatly improved. [2] With a wealth of experiments on the point cloud of the test system, this method is proven to be effective in the sharing of geometric features and the power of modeling the geometric relationships between the points.",
        " Understanding 3D point clouds requires capturing local geometric features and global context information. Although convolutional neural networks have been proven effective in this task, they often have difficulties in encoding the global context. This paper introduces a new operation of convolution, which enables the incorporation of global context into the extraction of local features. Using the attention mechanism, the global context of the point cloud is computed, which includes the relative importance of different parts of the point cloud to each point. The global context is fused with local features during convolution to reason about the relationships between distant points and to learn the semantic information of the whole scene. The effectiveness of GCAC on various 3D point cloud understanding tasks, including object classification, part separation and semantic segmentation, is demonstrated. On a large-scale data set, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art.",
        " Multi-scale object detection often uses feature pyramids to capture objects of different sizes, but existing methods usually apply static and one-size-fits-all strategies to feature fusion, which neglects the inherent variability of objects between samples and even in the same image. This paper introduces a new approach to feature fusion called DSIC, which is sample-responsive and can adapt to the features of different samples. The proposed method uses a simple attention mechanism to set the weight of fusion according to the global image context and the sample features, which improves detection accuracy, especially for small, occluding and variable-scaled objects. Our experiments show that the sample-responsive fusion strategy can greatly enhance the performance of multi-scale object detection. Extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark data sets show that DSIC consistently outperforms the current multi-scale object detection methods, indicating its effectiveness in adapting to the dynamic and individual needs of different samples.",
        " Neural network non-local block has been an important way to express the global dependencies between the neural layers, and has improved the performance of the neural networks in many different tasks. However, different non-local blocks often have different structures and functions, and it is difficult to understand the principle and choose the appropriate architecture. The aim of this paper is to establish a unified framework for the non-local blocks and analyze their key components, so as to highlight the similarities between them. In the unified framework, a general non-local block is derived, and the previous ones are special cases. Then explore the design space of the non-local blocks, and analyze the performance and efficiency of the different components. , and to obtain a more efficient and effective non-local block architecture for neural networks.",
        " As a matter of fact, we were very pleased to discover the good results of a machine which learned to shave with the use of this simple method. Our method, which is based on an efficient method of calculating the bias function, the difference between the present policy and the perfect policy, is new, and our first experiments were a little disappointing, but we do not believe that it would be more promising to continue this line of research. Our experimental results on a number of standard problems, proving the theoretical guarantees that the bias is bound, prove that the proposed method produces a significant reduction in the regret. We prove the theoretical bounds by numerical examples on standard problems, showing that our method is far more effective than existing methods, especially in the case of large spaces.",

Through a combination of empirical results on some of the most well-known datasets, and visualizations of the learned feature spaces, we illustrate the main mechanisms driving the feature learning process, providing insights into the SSCL process and improving model design, and provide a deeper understanding of the unsupervised learning process. We explore the dynamics of feature evolution during training, analysing the interplay between instance discrimination, data augmentation, and contrastive loss.",
        " To meet these difficulties, we have devoted ourselves to the exposition of a system of rules, which we have called a motor of antiaircraft machine. Our object is to design a method of making the motions of the machine more exact, by means of a machine. We present here the state-action space, the mechanism, the reward and the training of the controller. We describe the details of the environment and the action and the adversity of the system. We study the action and the reward, and we adopt the form of a machine, by analogy with the moto of the armoured anti-aircraft machine. The action of the rules is made more exact and simpler, in order to train the operator of the machine.",
        " Here is the latest system to do the thing. Having seen that previous methods were generally complex, stateful, and iterative, we propose to employ a stateless actor-critic neural network, which directly predicts instance masks from the global image features and, on the basis of high-level priors such as object classes and spatial relations, gives better accuracy and consistency in the execution of the task. When our method is tested on the image data from the public domain, it achieves comparable performance and better generalization than state-of-the-art models, but with a simpler and more efficient architecture. The actor network generates instance proposals, and the critic network evaluates the quality of these proposals based on pixel-level accuracy and conformity to high-level priors.",
        " XGAN: Many-to-Many Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation We introduce XGAN, a novel unsupervised framework for many-to-many image translation. Unsupervised image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping between two visual domains without relying on examples from either. As existing methods often perform well with a 1:N or 1:M mapping, they often fail with the more general and challenging many-to-many mapping, where a single input can have multiple plausible outcomes. We evaluate XGAN on several challenging data sets and show its superiority over existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics. We introduce a disentangled latent space between the two domains, which allows for flexible control over the translation process, and a novel cross-domain consistency loss that ensures semantic consistency and avoids mode collapse, which is a frequent issue in many-to-many cases. XGAN enables flexible and controllable image-to-image translation without paired examples.",
        " The invention of clustering, the basic principle of which is to form groups of a certain number of objects, has been applied to medical images for the purposes of segmenting and classifying them. In this connection, the paper now before us proposes a new fuzzy clustering which takes into account the spatial position of the object to be classified in order to improve the robustness and accuracy of the resulting groups. The result is a significant improvement in the accuracy of the segmentation. Experiments on various modalities of medical images have shown that this method outperforms the standard fuzzy c-means, and even other recent segmentation methods, in terms of the accuracy of the results, their resistance to noise, and the stability of the segmentation. The basic method is the one used by Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and in this has been improved by considering the influence of neighbouring points. The paper’s authors are of the opinion that this method offers a promising solution for the accurate segmentation of medical images and the formulation of a clinical diagnosis.",
        " Now, the task of modifying the properties of 3D molecules is a difficult problem in the field of drug discovery and the study of new materials. However, a good way to deal with this problem is reinforcement learning (RL). But RL systems suffer from a low level of scalability in the case of 3D molecules. Besides, 3D molecules have a symmetry, which, if ignored, leads to inefficient exploration and learning. On the other hand, a symmetry-aware actor-critic is a new learning system which takes advantage of the symmetry of the 3D molecules to allow the generalization to all positions and orientations. And equivariant neural networks are used to make the policy and the value invariant to the symmetry. The above results show the importance of symmetry in RL-based molecular design and suggest that new molecules with superior properties can be found by a better understanding of the symmetry. Our new system shows considerable improvements over the original system in terms of the discovery of new molecules with superior properties.",
        " In the following paper, we make a comparative analysis of two distinct implementations for the automatic segmentation of skin lesions. The two implementations may differ in their architecture, their training strategy, or their pre-processing strategy. We examine the performance differences and characteristics of these implementations on a series of clinical images obtained with a dermoscopy apparatus. The aim of this analysis is to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each implementation, to contribute to the understanding of the factors influencing segmentation performance, and to improve the methods of detecting skin lesions automatically. The accuracy of the two implementations is measured using standard metrics such as the Dice coefficient, the Jaccard index, sensitivity, and specificity.",

It is studied how to combine several generative models through ensemble learning and conditional generatives, so as to increase the fidelity and the diversity of the generated images. The quality of the generated images is evaluated by both the qualitative and the objective method. Using the metrics derived from the model, such as the Fréchet inception distance, it is shown that the synthesis can be used to enrich existing data. It can improve the performance of existing algorithms and facilitate the development of more robust and reliable screening tools for the detection of diseases.",
        " classic autoencoders are known to have difficulties with data that possess intrinsic symmetry, namely rotation, since they must repeat the same learning many times for different orientations. In this paper, we introduce a rotation-invariant autoencoder, which is based on spherical harmonics, a natural representation of functions on the sphere. We show the effectiveness of our method on simulated and real data, and demonstrate that it outperforms both classic autoencoders and other rotation-invariant methods. By introducing spherical convolutions and pooling operations, we ensure that the latent space of the autoencoder is rotationally invariant. This gives it more compact and meaningful representations, which enable the autoencoder to perform better in tasks such as reconstruction, classification, and anomaly detection of spherical data. Our experiments on simulated data show that our method is effective on signals of arbitrary shape.",

Then we investigate several variants of the original method, with modifications to the criteria for matching blocks, the type of 3D transformation, and the fusion of filters. The results show the effectiveness of the VBM3D method, and the advantages and disadvantages of the variants studied. These results are very useful for practical denoising applications.",
        " The aim of this paper is to present Katana, a simple and effective post-training method for strengthening the model against small perturbations of the input data. It relies on the inherent diversity of the augmentations applied during inference, and by means of this, obtains a large number of results for a single input. In a recent paper, the same idea was used to train two neural networks to do face-recognition of digits, but it was not sufficient for this application. This paper shows that Katana can be integrated into an existing inference model with little added cost and without access to the training data. The resulting predictions are then aggregated to produce a more robust and reliable final prediction.",
        " A system is proposed for manifold learning which enables us to formalize and generalize existing manifold learning algorithms in terms of functors. MANIFOLD LEARNING (ML) is a family of learning methods for discovering manifolds from data. ML introduces a new view of ML, in the context of category theory, specifically in terms of functors. This new framework offers several advantages: it provides a unified way to understand and compare different ML methods, it gives a principled way to design new methods by composing existing functors or by defining new functorial mappings, and it provides a formal language for analyzing the stability and robustness of manifold learning methods under various perturbations. To illustrate the power of this functorial view, we formalize several classic ML methods as functors. Moreover, we present a new system for designing more robust and flexible ML methods, which paves the way for applications to complex data-analysis problems.",
        " An artificial method is presented here which is named the \"few-shot classifier.\" Few-shot classification, the problem of classifying objects with a few examples, is a difficult problem. In the past, few-shot classification has been accomplished by several methods; but they often fail to generalize to unseen categories. It is characteristic of a few-shot classifier to learn the relationship between the features. The relationship between the features and the target image can be learned by using the transformer. The cycle consistency loss makes the learned feature invariant to the change in the relationship between the two images, thus improving generalization performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a few-shot segmentation benchmark.",
        " The paper presents a new method of ice-rink localization in hockey broadcasts. The method uses a combination of [for example: edge detection, color separation, Hough transform, etc.] to identify the main features in the image, such as the boundary of the ice, the center line and the circles of the face-off. Accurate localization of the ice-rink in broadcasted hockey videos is a prerequisite for many applications, such as automatic player tracking, augmented reality overlays and enhanced statistical analysis. Thus, this paper contributes to the development of more advanced and automated tools for the analysis of broadcasted hockey videos, thereby improving the experience of the audience and providing advanced data-driven insights. Experimental results on a large dataset of broadcasted hockey videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and [for example: high accuracy, robustness, etc.] compared to existing methods.",

        " To meet this deficiency of information, we introduce THEODORE, a synthetic dataset, containing a large number of objects and the most varied of rooms. Besides its wealth of photorealistic images, the THEODORE database provides semantic segmentation, object segmentation, and depth maps. The completeness of this information makes it possible to optimize a pre-training phase for different tasks in indoor scene analysis. The experimental results show that models that have been pre-trained on THEODORE can significantly improve the performance of deep learning models in comparison with models not pre-trained or pre-trained in common ways. For practitioners and research workers, THEODORE provides a valuable resource for indoor scene analysis, especially with omnidirectional images, and for the development of more robust and accurate deep learning models.",

Using the full spherical view, we can overcome the difficulties of occlusion and limited perspective that occur in conventional methods. We present experimental results on (give details, e.g., on a set of data) that show the improved accuracy and robustness of our method over conventional methods, particularly in the presence of occlusion and overlapping views. This approach can robustly track the trajectory of each person through the scene. This allows accurate localization and detailed analysis of individual movements and interactions, even in crowded scenes. Thus, the system could be used for applications such as crowd surveillance, crowd control, virtual reality, and the like, which require the tracking of a large number of people.",
        " But there is a drawback, namely, that due to the small amount of labelled training data available for the learning task, the accuracy of the classification can be severely affected. Transfer learning offers a solution by transferring knowledge from similar sources. It uses a deep convolutional network that is combined with spectral and spatial features from the source and the target. This paper proposes an ‘Active Transfer Learning Neural Net’, which is a unified deep convolutional network for feature learning based on spectral and spatial features in the source and target domains, and takes advantage of the active learning framework to use available labelled data more effectively. Testing the ATLNet on the HSI benchmark data shows that it outperforms the most commonly used classification method. The paper also demonstrates that the active learning strategy based on uncertainty sampling can effectively select the most appropriate labelled data from the target domain to optimize the effectiveness of transfer learning.",

It is a method to overcome the problem of different image modalities and the diversity of anatomical structures, which can be adapted to various applications. And the proof is that the Cascade Decoder always outperforms existing decoding methods and reaches the state-of-the-art performance. Its versatility and effectiveness are demonstrated by integrating it with different encoder architectures and evaluating it on several standardized data sets that span different imaging modalities (e.g. microscopy, MRI, CT) and anatomical structures (e.g. cells, organs, tumors).",

The model of the environment, learnt by this method, is used as an internal reward for the robot, which has the advantage of improved performance and robustness of the environment. This agent learns the optimal control policy to manage the key greenhouse conditions, such as temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide content, so as to optimize the plant growth and minimize the energy consumption of the greenhouse. The agent can also be trained by the data collected from the real greenhouse environment, which enables the robot to perform its planning and exploration without affecting the real system directly.",

We will show, in particular, that analogies can drastically reduce the exploration time in relation to the costs of a PAC-MDP exploration, particularly in the case of environments which have an underlying structural regularity. We give theoretical results which demonstrate that the exploration based on analogy reaches a PAC bound, and we will show some first experiments which confirm the results of the theory.",
        " Our aim is to estimate the duration of industrial equipments by encoding the internal state of the equipments by a neural network, which makes use of the intrinsic structure of the equipment. The condition of the individual parts is encoded in the nodes, and the interactions of the parts are represented by the edges. The model is applied to the industrial equipment, and its behaviour, with an external threshold set at a given value, is represented by a graph. The graph is evaluated at a later time by the values of the external state. We have tested this model on a reference data set and proved the efficiency of the approach by obtaining better results in predicting the duration than the existing methods. This demonstrates the value of GNNs for the industrial prognostics.",

Our method eliminates the need to estimate MI and is therefore faster and more scalable than conventional methods. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark data sets and obtained better results than existing methods and comparable results with the best.

Exploiter works by successively retraining an agent to exploit the current weaknesses of its opponents. We provide a proof of convergence in a large state space environment and present empirical evaluations of the method in a set of known MARL tasks, which demonstrate that the performance of Exploiter is significantly better than that of existing methods, both in terms of speed of convergence and final performance. This is an important step towards the development of MARL methods that can scale to complex real-world tasks.",

This paper discusses the application of sparse optimization methods to neural network compression, and introduces the idea of reducing the weights and the activation of the neural network by using the sparse regularization method, the group lasso method and the sparse regularization method. In this paper, we discuss the performance trade-off between compression and accuracy, and prove the effectiveness of sparse optimization in reducing the complexity of the neural network and improving the generalization performance. At the same time, we also discuss how to implement sparse neural networks efficiently in hardware and software. It has been proved by the experiments on the sample data that sparse optimization can significantly reduce the complexity of neural networks without affecting their accuracy, and it can be applied to the deployment of deep learning on resource-limited devices.",
        " The normal methods of photogrammetry, by reason of the shadows, are often unable to construct a true or complete 3D-model of the ground. The introduction of the method of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has been made to meet the great difficulty of constructing a true 3D-model from the multi-view images of the earth. The success of NeRF has been proved on a variety of images from space, and on the ground that the 3D-models obtained are of a high accuracy and completeness. But the ground is very often covered with shadows, and NeRF is unable to separate the true albedo of the surfaces from the observed shaded appearance. By the introduction of a shadow visibility factor and by the learning of a neural color map for shadow-awareness, NeRF can be said to be able to reconstruct the geometry and texture of the ground in the shadows, thereby increasing the accuracy and completeness compared with the ordinary NeRFs, as well as with the old photogrammetric methods.",
        " Gaussian processes are powerful tools for probabilistic modelling. However, their predictions are Gaussian, which limits their use in the context of complex non-Gaussian data. This paper introduces a novel approach to transforming the output of a Gaussian process using normalizing flows, thereby enabling the generation of flexible and expressive predictions. We propose a formulation which combines Gaussian processes and normalizing flows in a way which facilitates efficient inference and prediction. We present experimental results on several large-scale datasets, showing that this approach is able to capture complex data distributions and improve prediction accuracy compared to Gaussian processes and other non-Gaussian extensions of Gaussian processes. Our method provides a principled and flexible way to extend the applicability of Gaussian processes to real-world applications where non-Gaussianity is an important feature of the data.",

MolCLR is a new way to learn molecular representations using contrastive learning in graph neural networks. It has been shown that MolCLR is effective in a variety of downstream tasks, such as molecular property prediction and virtual screening. These views are used to train a GNN model to learn the similarity between different views of the same molecule, and the difference between the representations of different molecules. This contrastive learning framework promotes the GNN to learn robust and informative representations that can be used for the prediction of molecular properties.

        " Our method is to use a two-stage system, one to obtain a dense depth map from the input image and the other to compose a novel view from a six-degrees-of-freedom camera, from a single image. In the first stage a depth map is obtained from the input image by a depth estimation network. This depth map is combined with a six-degrees-of-freedom camera to warp the input image to the novel view. The second stage uses a refinement network to suppress the artifacts and disocclusions introduced by the warping and compose a novel view. Our experiments on standard image datasets show that the proposed method achieves good results, and it is simpler and more efficient than state-of-the-art methods.",

Through experiments, we show that transfer-learned classifiers are indeed vulnerable to misclassification attacks and highlight the need for robust countermeasures to ensure accurate classification in real-world applications. We examine the effect of various transfer learning paradigms, pre-trained model architectures, and attack parameters on the robustness of the resulting classifiers. The underlying factors that contribute to the vulnerability are discussed, and the corresponding direction of future research on text classification is discussed.",
        " A novel approach is proposed in this paper to overcome this problem by using a neural sequence model. The essentials of the clinical data, such as the values of vital signs and laboratory measurements, contain intrinsic invariances caused by factors such as the patients’ race, the measurement scales and the time shifts. The absence of these invariances makes the development of robust and generalizable models difficult. Therefore, we introduce a neural sequence model that learns to attend to these invariances and trains the network to recognize them. In addition, we use specialized attentional layers to compensate for these invariances and ensure that the model is invariant in all circumstances and patients. Our method allows the development of more accurate and interpretable clinical models. We evaluated our method on real clinical time series, and the results were much better than that of the standard models.",
        " Image to image translation aims to convert an image into another, but it is difficult to get accurate control and local consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel method called local mask-based image to image translation, which aims to translate the region that is to be translated by the use of a mask. The spatial information of the image is directly used in the translation process. We use this spatial information to show how to use the spatial information to solve the translation problem, and compare the accuracy and effectiveness of the existing global translation method. This paper compares the mask information with the translation of global methods and demonstrates that the mask information can be used for a variety of image translation tasks. It can be accurately and accurately matched, and can be used for the precise control of the region that has been translated.",

This paper introduces a variational approximation which operates directly on multisets and thus provides a more accurate estimation of the posterior distribution of the proportion of integer solutions. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the theoretical superiority of the multiset approximation over the existing set-based methods. We provide an empirical evaluation of the method on synthetic and real-world data showing its superiority over set-based methods for tasks such as feature selection and summary generation. In particular, we derive a tractable variational lower bound which exploits the submodularity of the objective function and is proven to converge to the true posterior distribution under suitable conditions.",
        " A system for visualising the principles of similarity in object relations is needed. We address the need for explainable similarity models by introducing a framework for visual explanations of the similarities between objects. We show the effectiveness of our approach on [datasets and models, e.g. image classification and face recognition with convolutional neural networks as the similarity models], which provides intuitive and informative visual explanations that increase users’ understanding and trust in similarity-based systems. Our method uses attention mechanisms and feature visualization techniques to reveal the features and areas of the data that are most relevant to the similarity score. This allows users to understand the reasons for similarity and to identify the key features driving the decision of the model. In this way, we make a step towards more transparent and accountable similarity models and therefore towards their more widespread use in critical applications.",

We achieve this by [repeat the procedure here; e.g. by learning a latent space where the prototypes are defined, by using attention mechanisms that connect the input to the prototypes, and so on.] This allows the explainability of our model to be increased and the predictability increased.",
        " Using the classification features obtained by previous methods, this paper presents a method of developing new articulations of features by using the polynomial function, which enables higher order interactions between the features. In particular, by using the neural language of neural networks, it is possible to translate a mathematically undefined process into a piecewise polynomial function. Using this function, it is possible to build more complex models of the data, and to possibly enhance the discriminating ability. Various different polynomial architectures, with fixed degree and degree-dependent polynomials, are investigated and evaluated on a standard test set. The results indicate that polynomial models can obtain better classification performance than conventional deep learning models, particularly for non-linear tasks. We also examine the effects of the degree of the polynomials and the depth of the network on the classification performance, and give guidelines for the design of the best network architectures for different classification problems.",

        " The classical cycle GANs are useful for anomaly detection, learning the mapping between normal and abnormal data distributions, but they are prone to mode collapse, and they cannot realistically generate abnormal data. The current work proposes a new method of anomaly detection based on regularized cycle GAN. Our regularization aims to maintain the structure of the data and minimize the distance between the abnormal data and the input data in the latent space. Then the network can accurately detect abnormal data from normal data. The experiments show that the regularized cycle GAN can achieve a higher detection accuracy and stability than previous methods. We tested the proposed regularized cycle GAN on a number of well-known anomaly detection data sets.",

        " “This paper presents the learning of differential temporal difference, an improved variant of the learning of temporal difference that improves its behavior in non-stationary environments, and in the presence of value functions involving relative values. Unlike the temporal difference method, which is based on estimating the value of the current state of affairs, differential temporal difference focuses on the value of the difference between two consecutive states or actions. This leads to many advantages such as more stability and faster convergence for changing rewards and policies. The differential temporal difference is based on a simple mechanism that makes it possible to get a good result even in non-stationary environments, which are a problem for the temporal difference method. This paper presents the differential temporal difference method, which is based on the concept of learning the difference between two states or actions. By learning the difference between two states, this method is more able to adapt to the changes in the environment and does not accumulate errors as in the temporal difference method. It explains the theoretical basis of differential temporal difference and explains its practical use in reinforcement learning.",
        " Graph Representation Learning tries to find a low-dimensional representation of a graph to facilitate the tasks of node classification, edge prediction, and graph clustering. Despite the significant successes in the field of GRL, the interpretability and evaluation of learned representations remain important challenges. This paper presents an overview of the challenges in GRL and presents a detailed overview of the problems. Moreover, we discuss the need for a more rigorous evaluation procedure that would take into account more than just the performance on the training data, and suggest the development of a new evaluation methodology that goes beyond simple task performance to consider the generalization, the resilience to noise, and the capacity to learn more complex graph structure. We review the existing techniques to interpret graph embeddings, focusing on methods that try to reveal the relationship between the dimensions and the graph structure. Also, we outline the future trends of the field, highlighting the need for new methods to improve the interpretability and evaluation of learned representations.",

For the food industry, and for industry generally, the use of the Internet of Things is becoming more and more necessary, and it is becoming more and more necessary to get a good idea of the machinery that is being used, the working conditions, the machines, and the staff who manage them. Hence it is essential that the automatic machines and the people of the industries concerned are provided with methods of detecting and classifying faults in their machinery, or else the efficiency of such machinery will be greatly impaired. I propose a system of machines for detecting faults, which is based on a system which is based on the Internet of Things. I am using a program that is running on my own machine, but it is also possible to be used by others, and the aim of this program is to detect faults and build a mechanism for finding faults by the use of a program that has been adapted from a programme which is programmed to detect faults.

In this abstract we will consider a few methods of improving the expressivity of GNNs, allowing them to identify and interpret more complex patterns of relations and patterns in graphs. These improvements are analyzed in terms of their theoretical and practical merits, with a view towards improving the performance of GNNs on a wide range of problems from node classification and link prediction, to graph prediction tasks. We also discuss the trade-offs between expressivity and efficiency, in order to design more powerful and efficient GNNs.",
        " These days, in the field of learning, to conceive a method of discovering the inverted-consistency of mathematical functions between different kinds of data has been a great problem in our day, a problem which is to some extent solved by the use of neural networks. But it is a difficult task, and one of the most difficult problems of all in a mathematical sense. The learned map must, if it be inverted, lead back to the original data. Icon is demonstrated to be effective in various tasks, such as image-to-image translation and multi-modal registration. Experimental results show that Icon achieves a good level of performance, especially in the case of paired data, and its effectiveness in learning regular and invertible maps is shown. This constraint is expressed in the form of an inverse-consistency loss, a powerful self-supervisional signal that reduces the need for paired data.",

This paper examines the leakage of sensitive information about individual datasets. We show that if a certain property is obtained, such as the class distribution, feature statistics, and the presence of special populations, it can be learned from the model intermediate results and even the final model, even if it is obtained by an honest-but-curious model, and a malicious model. We also analyze the vulnerability of various MPML protocols and architectures to such leakage attacks, and analyze the confidentiality of the results of MPML learning. Finally, we study some defense methods, such as differential privacy and secure aggregation, to reduce the risk of data leakage while preserving the utility of learning. This study points out that the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the risks of MPML must be taken into account. It is necessary to study the design of MPML learning in a broader sense, so as to avoid the ambiguity of MPML learning, and the design of learning that is more secure.",

The experiments show that the proposed method is much more robust to attacks than existing methods, while also achieving strong performance in nominal conditions. The paper develops a practical learning mechanism which exploits this framework and shows its effectiveness in learning robust policies. The theoretical analysis makes clear the close relation between smoothing and robustness, which sheds light on the design of robust learning algorithms.",
        " Our method uses an approach to depth estimation which models the local transformations of the scene in the form of region deformer networks. This approach learns to estimate depth by learning the local geometric transformations of the scene in the form of the deformations of the regions in the video frames. In particular, the deformations are regularized so that they are smooth and consistent with epipolar geometry. We partition the frame into regions and train the network to predict the deformation fields which map the regions between frames. By minimizing the photometric error between the warped regions and the target frame, the network learns implicitly the depth. The results demonstrate that a method which learns explicitly the local geometric transformations of the scene is a promising tool for the robust and accurate estimation of depth from unconstrained monocular videos. We demonstrate that our method works well even in the presence of large motion and occlusions, and we show that it performs better than existing unsupervised monocular depth estimation methods on standard tests.",
        " This paper introduces the RealFormer, a new architecture which explicitly takes account of residual attention. While attention is crucial to long-range dependencies, the importance of residual attention, a seemingly simple addition, is often neglected. RealFormer does not simply add the output of the attention mechanism to the input, but rather learns to attend selectively to the input itself and to the input with attention-weighted context, thus effectively regulating the contribution of the attention mechanism. This allows the model to maintain a dynamic balance between the input and the processed context, thereby achieving better performance. We show the effectiveness of the RealFormer on several sequence modeling tasks, demonstrating that its superior performance on these tasks is achieved at comparable complexity. It also has the advantage that it is capable of both universal and task-dependent learning. Our experiments highlight the importance of residual attention in learning systems and point to a new approach to the design of attention-based neural networks.",

This paper presents a novel method of detecting and tracking objects in depth images, using the nodes and edges of this graph. The method is robust to occlusion and noisy depth data. For object detection, the node graph is searched for the most connected set of nodes, which matches the expected object characteristics. For object tracking, the node graph is propagated to new images, and the node and edge information is combined with depth information to identify objects. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are presented.",

Although the deep neural networks have demonstrated excellent performance in many tasks, their high memory requirements and large computation time make them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. In the paper, we introduce a metric to calculate the redundancy of filters based on [simultaneity, eta, cosine similarity, etc.], and develop an efficient pruning method that iteratively selects and prunes redundant filters. Experiments on the network and data on the paper show that the technique can achieve significant compression with low performance degradation, and is superior to existing filter pruning methods. The method can be effectively used to deploy deep learning models on resource-constrained platforms.",

        " Approaching subspace discovery in corrupted high-dimensional data is a central problem in machine learning and computer vision. We propose the Block-Diagonal Adaptive Locality-constrained Representation (BALR), which tries to learn a representation which preserves a diagonal structure while accommodating local data features and robust to corruption. The block-diagonal structure is obtained by a regularization which favors the grouping of data points belonging to the same subspace. The robustness to outliers and noise is achieved by a sparse error, which models data corruption. The regularization is expressed as an energy which makes the objective function convex under the grouping and the sparsity constraints. We present extensive experiments on synthetic and real data which show that the proposed method is able to discover the hidden subspace structure of the data with good accuracy and robustness to outliers and noise. We formulate the problem as an optimization and develop an efficient iterative method for its solution.",

However, the convexity constraint in the previous works hinders the scalability, especially when the dimensionality of the data is large and the view relationships are complex. This paper proposes a novel framework which relaxes the convexity constraint, thereby opening the way to more efficient and scalable solutions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by extensive experiments on several real-world datasets, comparing it with the state-of-the-art convex-based online multi-view learning methods. We use (describe the details of the technique here, e.g., a non-convex factorization approach, or a version of the stochastic gradient descent with a specific regularizer) to significantly reduce the computation complexity, while maintaining competitive or even superior performance.

Using non-maximum suppression, the performance of such post-processing methods often degrades under noisy conditions or in crowded scenes. This paper introduces RMOPP, a new framework for multi-objective post-processing for object detection. RMOPP, a new framework for post-processing for object detection, combines the information from the score, overlap and robustness metrics into a single objective function that outperforms all other post-processing methods on both object detection architectures and datasets. The methods, which rely on a Pareto-based optimization, produce multiple solutions, resulting in a flexible and robust choice of final detections. A comparison of the methods’ performance on difficult test cases demonstrates their capability to improve the performance of detection systems.",
        " During the last two years, fake accounts have become an increasing problem on social media platforms. Fake accounts can be used to distort public opinion, spread false news, and commit fraud. This paper proposes a new method of identifying fake accounts in social media based on the power of natural language processing and graph theory. NLP linguistic features and graph embeddings, which are created from the network, are combined to form a strong and complete feature set, which is used to train a machine-learning classifier. We first build a graph of interactions between users and use graph embedding to obtain a low-dimensional representation of users in this graph, which can represent certain social patterns and community relationships. The result is a large number of interesting and useful features for identifying fake users. Experimental results on a real-world social-media platform show that this method works well and improves the performance of existing methods based on either text or network features.",
        " About V2W-BERT: a new framework for the effective classification of software security. Accurate classification of software security is necessary for the proper management and mitigation of these problems. Existing approaches, however, often ignore the hierarchical structure of vulnerability taxonomies and, for this reason, the hierarchical classification of security is very important. Our proposed method, V2W-BERT, first uses a V2W technique to capture the semantic relations between a vulnerability and its corresponding term, and then applies a hierarchical BERT to the resulting word embedding. The V2W representation is then used as an input to a BERT model that has been specially tuned to support hierarchical classification. This framework provides a more accurate and precise understanding of the software security problem, enabling more effective security practices. We show by experiments on a large scale security dataset that V2W-BERT outperforms existing approaches on a multi-class classification task, and especially at higher levels of the vulnerability hierarchy.",

This is necessary for self-propelled robots which operate in complex 3D spaces. Our method is based on a Neural Net which, while taking account of local geometric and semantic features, takes also into account the relations between the points. Experiments on a set of standard datasets demonstrate that this method yields a performance which is substantially superior to that of previous methods. In fact, the knowledge of the semantic relations between the neighboring points has a positive influence on the quality of the resulting segments, and in particular on those in which the data are noisy or the boundaries are not sharply defined. And so, knowing thy neighbors is a strong advantage for understanding the 3D world.",

We propose a novel time-series representation learning method based on unsupervised learning that relies on deep neural networks and, in particular, on locality-sensitive hashing. The learned time-series representations are then retrieved by stratified LSH to retrieve similar episodes. The stratified LSH mechanism, by prioritizing the physiological parameters that are most important for hypotensive crises prediction, enables higher sensitivity in the similarity search. Finally, the similar episodes are analyzed to predict the onset of a crisis. The proposed method allows us to detect the onset of a crisis early, with a greater accuracy than the most used methods. We demonstrate this on a real clinical data set, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting hypotensive crises.",
        " They could easily get caught up in the web of medical images, in which they cannot see the objects, the relations, the various elements, and the complex interconnections which make them up. Medical image segmentation plays an important role in many clinical applications, as in the diagnostics, the treatment, and the subsequent evolution of the patient. On the other hand, the part played by deep learning methods in such images is much more limited, and the finely graded accuracy is not so good. By combining the best of both methods, a hybrid encoder is introduced in the TransFuse method, enabling both local details and long-distance relationships to be represented. This method is called TransFuse, and uses a hybrid encoder which is a hybrid of the use of the Convolutional Neural Net and the Use of the Transformer. TransFuse has been tested on several medical image datasets, and has shown its superiority over other methods based on the use of the Convolutional Neural Net and the use of the use of the transformer. It is also noteworthy that a dedicated fusion system is used which enables the information extracted by the use of the Convolutional Neural Net and the use of the use of the transformer to be integrated in a single system, enabling both to exchange information and to act as a single system.",

In order to address this shortcoming, we present BiGCN, a GNN that effectively captures both local and global graph structures by combining two low-pass filters: the conventional aggregation that focuses on neighbor nodes and a novel propagation that focuses on differences between neighbor nodes. This allows BiGCN to accurately capture both local and global graph structures. In our experiments on several well-known benchmarks, we have found that BiGCN significantly outperforms other existing GNNs in learning richer and more useful graph representations.",

The method is based on the operation of recurrent neural networks at different levels of the hierarchy which, by propagating and learning information at each level of the hierarchy, are able to reason about the composition and the context of several actions, and have, in consequence, superior results to the results obtained by the methods hitherto known. Specifically, the hierarchy permits the formation of representations of various degrees of abstraction, from the individual action to the high-level context of actions. In this paper we show the effectiveness of the hierarchical graphs recurrent neural network in understanding and interpreting the complex context of actions in scenes. We present results on challenging data that show the capability of HG-RNNs to recognize complex actions and their context.",

General-topic abstract: Domain adaptation is to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, the general-class distribution of the data in the two domains may not be the same. This paper proposes a new batch-weighted domain adaptation method to deal with the problem of class imbalance. The weight of each batch is adjusted according to the difference between the source and the target, so that the bias of the whole batch is corrected, and the generalization performance is improved. We have a lot of experiments on the data of the mtm, and the performance of our method is significantly better than that of existing domain adaptation methods. 2. Emphasis on batch weighting: Adaptation performance decreases when the classes of the source and target are shifted. This paper introduces a batch weighting strategy to overcome this problem. The weight of each batch is corrected according to the class difference between the source and the target, so that the generalization performance of the whole batch is improved. Experiments on many kinds of data show that our proposed batch-weighted domain adaptation method can improve the accuracy of domain adaptation, especially for the data with a large class imbalance. There are many problems in the design of current domain adaptation methods, such as ignoring the domain difference, and introducing a large amount of error into the target domain. We discuss the existing problems and propose a new batch-weighted domain adaptation method.

        " Deep reinforcement learning agents are becoming an important part of safety-critical applications. Unlike previous adversarial attacks, which use external inputs to influence an agent’s decision-making, our attack uses in-distribution triggers that are imperceptible to the agent. This way, an adversary can affect the learning of the agent during training, leading to malicious behaviour during deployment. Our experiments on several reinforcement learning systems show the effectiveness of in-distribution poisoning and the need for robust defenses against such attacks. Using carefully constructed triggers, we can influence the agent’s learning process during training, leading to malicious behaviour during deployment. Moreover, we analyse the effect of the characteristics of the triggers on the success of the attacks and discuss potential countermeasures to mitigate the risks of such attacks.",
        " An FNN extracts spatial and temporal features from a sequence of samples. Combined with a Variational Auto-Encoder, the proposed method has the advantages of using the FNN to extract the features and the VAE to learn a robust latent space representation of the normal patterns. Then, the outputs of the FNN are fed into the VAE to generate the normal trajectory representation. Anomalies are identified by comparing the reconstruction error between the original trajectory and the reconstructed trajectory by the VAE. It is also possible to use the latent space obtained by the VAE to classify trajectories by training a classifier on the latent space of known classes. Experimental results on the FMS and M3D datasets show that the proposed method is effective in both the classification of normal trajectories and the detection of abnormal trajectories.",

The Evolutionary State Graph (ESG) is a way of representing the system state as a graph. Nodes represent events and edges represent transitions between them. In particular, the ESG evolves with time, which reflects the dynamic nature of the system. We propose a method for learning the ESG from historical events and using it to predict future events.

In such scenes, most methods have a hard time refining the initial instances, which results in wrong predictions. RICE represents each instance mask as a node in a graph where the edges capture the relationships between instances based on their spatial and semantic similarity. It then refines the instances by propagating information across the graph, allowing the model to reason about the context of each instance and to resolve ambiguities. The experiments show that modeling the inter-instance relationships using GNNs can lead to a more robust segmentation of instances in complex scenes.",

        " Abstract: Neural networks have become extremely powerful tools for approximating complex functions, but their ability to represent and generate distributions is less well understood. We explore the scope of distributions which different neural network architectures can effectively model, and we investigate the theoretical limitations and practical considerations of using neural networks for distribution representation. We discuss aspects such as likelihood estimation, generative modeling, and variational inference. Our results lead to a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of neural networks as probabilistic models, and they offer insights for the design of more effective architectures and training strategies for various applications that require distribution representation. We discuss the challenges of modeling high-dimensional and multimodal distributions, and we explore techniques for modeling complex dependencies and spiking.",
        " So that the semantic graphs are created and identified, we then select and map the place using semantic segmentation. We have created a semantic graph where the nodes correspond to semantic objects and the edges represent their spatial relationships. The proposed graph matching method allows us to determine the presence of a matching place by comparing the semantic graphs at two different locations. Considering the spatial relations of nodes and the spatial relationships of edges, we achieve an accurate and reliable place matching. This semantic graph is a more reliable and meaningful representation of the environment, overcoming the difficulties of point clouds, such as the distortion of the viewpoint, the occlusion of objects and geometric ambiguity. This research shows that it is possible to build a reliable and accurate place recognition system for 3D environments. We have verified our method with experiments on a large number of points, compared to existing methods, and we show the superiority of our method in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.",

        " decision trees: Illuminated Decision Trees with Lucid A novel method for visualizing and interpreting decision trees in the context of feature attribution. Decision trees are a fundamental and widely used machine learning technique. However, they are difficult to understand, especially those with many branches and large dimensions. This paper describes the first general approach to illuminate decision trees by using Lucid. By applying Lucid's attribution methods to the dimension of each node of the tree, we can visualize the features with the most influence in each node, allowing us to understand the logic of the decision tree, find possible biases and verify the decision tree model. Interpretation of decision trees is improved in a practical and intuitive way and becomes more understandable for both experts and novices.",
        " In this paper, we introduce NAS-FCOS, which is an efficient and parallelizable method for object detection using neural network architecture search. Object detection is an important task in computer vision, and the recent advancement of deep learning has greatly improved its performance. However, the manual design of object detection architectures is a time-consuming and difficult task, and neural architecture search (NAS) is an effective but costly way of automatically discovering effective object detection architectures. To accelerate the search, we propose a new ranking strategy that is based on the learned predictor and can greatly reduce the number of architectures that need to be trained and tested. In this paper, we present NAS-FCOS, a new and efficient NAS framework for object detection. NAS-FCOS starts from the single-layer anchor-free FCOS as the search space and directly optimizes the detection architecture. The architecture discovered by NAS-FCOS is named NAS-FCOSNet, which can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the COCO and other image sequences, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. On the same data set, NAS-FCOS achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is significantly more efficient than existing NAS methods.",

We use a recurrent neural network to process the sequence of images in the absence of a spatially positioned camera. DeepPerimeter uses the available camera position as a reference, and combines the visual information with geometric constraints to form a boundary representation. Using this representation, we decode the interior’s boundary, represented as a sequence of points. We evaluate DeepPerimeter on challenging synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to camera motion and clutter.

This method essentially samples only the data that have the greatest influence on the discriminator's decision boundaries, thereby focusing the generator's learning on regions of high uncertainty and potential mode collapse. This leads to more diverse samples and less prone to mode collapse. Our experiments on the IMaGAN and CIFAR11 data sets indicate that LSS produces samples with better coverage and quality than any existing GAN-training method, even those that were developed specifically to prevent mode collapse.",

Experiments on [number of domains and data sets] have shown that our method can effectively characterize and reveal the underlying structure of policy divergence and reveal the relationship between the operator's features and the optimal policy. We also show that knowing the divergence can be used to improve the performance of the PMRL, for example, by (e.g., guiding the meta-learning process, grouping users with similar policy needs, and designing more effective personalization strategies). We propose a new way of analyzing the divergence of the policies by (e.g., analyzing the policy embeddings, evaluating the variance of action distributions, measuring the effectiveness of transfer between groups). In summary, our findings provide a useful tool for analyzing and improving the personalization in the reinforcement learning.",

        " This paper introduces GTEA, a novel method for learning the structure of temporal networks, based on graph temporal edge aggregation. The complexity of interactions between agents over time is crucial in many domains, such as social networks or biological systems. Temporal interaction graphs are a powerful framework for modeling such interactions, where nodes represent agents, and edges represent their interactions at certain times. Instead of using only node-centric information to compute the aggregation of node embeddings, GTEA uses information from neighboring edges to compute node embeddings that capture temporal dependencies. We introduce a novel aggregation mechanism for edges that considers both temporal proximity and the types of interaction of neighboring edges. The objective of GTEA is to optimize the aggregation of edge information to learn dynamic node representations that capture the temporal dependencies between nodes. The experiments on a variety of temporal interaction graphs show that GTEA outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We use the learned representations to perform tasks such as the prediction of edges and the classification of nodes.",

In each grid cell, full attention is applied, while the attention between the grids is limited to a learnable set of representative features. GPA provides a scalable trade-off between computational efficiency and model expressiveness, enabling the generation of finer details than existing global attention approximations. We show that GPA achieves both superior image quality and efficiency, compared to current methods. We conclude by demonstrating that GPA facilitates the application of deep learning methods to high-resolution image generation in resource-constrained settings.",

Graph neural networks have become a powerful tool for learning from graphs, enabling a wide range of applications. However, training graph neural networks with sensitive data raises privacy concerns. We study different strategies for achieving locally private graph neural networks, focusing on the mechanisms for perturbing node features, graph structure, and model parameters, and study the privacy-utility-speed trade-offs of different LDP strategies on GNN training. In particular, we propose a node-wise aggregation mechanism to improve the utility of locally private graph neural networks while preserving strong privacy guarantees. Our experiments on public graph data sets show that locally private GNNs can achieve good utility under strict privacy budgets, demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining private graph knowledge in practice.",

        " In this paper we investigate the universality properties of the invariant networks, a class of neural networks which are trained to preserve invariance under some well-defined input transformations. Although invariant networks have already been shown to be highly successful in applications requiring a robustness to translations, rotations, or permutations of the inputs, their real capacity remains poorly understood. We examine the conditions under which they can approximate continuous functions which, while respecting the same invariance, take any real values. The investigation results in a deeper understanding of the theoretical basis of invariant networks and give a deeper understanding of the design of efficient and accurate invariant networks. We prove, through both theoretical analysis and empirical tests, that under rather modest assumptions on the structure and the type of input-output functions, the invariant networks can approximate the invariant functions of any order and with any real value. Moreover, we analyze the relationship between invariance, network structure and the error of approximation, which will facilitate the design of efficient and accurate invariant networks.",
        " Existing colorization methods often struggle to produce colorizations that are visually plausible and diverse, especially in the absence of paired training images. Our method uses a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) with a diversity-promoting loss function to overcome this challenge. In particular, the diversity loss motivates the generator to explore the color space, inducing distinct colorizations from the same grayscale input, avoiding mode collapse and yielding more visually appealing results. We show that this method produces much better colorizations, both in quality and diversity, than existing unsupervised and weakly supervised methods. We show that our method is effective on several well-known datasets, achieving results that are superior to the best unsupervised and weakly supervised methods. We conclude that our method provides a robust and efficient method for producing diverse and visually plausible colorizations from a single grayscale input, without requiring paired data.",

Moreover, this method is highly efficient, and its \"overfitting\" strategy adds almost no additional computational cost, which makes it a useful and efficient solution for real-world SR applications. We show that our method outperforms other TTA methods for several kinds of test images and test conditions. Our intuition is that fitting the SR model to a limited number of related samples allows it to quickly acquire the specific characteristics and statistics of the test images while avoiding catastrophic loss of the general SR prior. Detailed experiments and a detailed ablation study demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method and the astonishing power of this method of targeted overfitting for TTA.",

We construct two types of graphs: the intra-modal graphs that model the semantic relationships between images and texts respectively, and the inter-modal graphs that model the correspondence between images and words. By using the GAT model to learn these graphs, the internal structure of the modality can be captured, and the cross-modality consistency can be captured. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

        " Semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud is important for a wide range of applications, including vehicle navigation and robots.

The architecture is based on PointNet++, and the training loss combines the labeled data and unlabeled data with a regularization term. In the experiments, the performance of SSPC-Net was significantly better than that of existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with less labeled data. We used a consistency regularization method, including two aspects: (1) feature consistency, requiring similar feature representations for different views of the same unlabeled point cloud; (2) prediction consistency, requiring consistent semantic predictions from different views of the same unlabeled scene. We found that the consistency regularization could make use of the unlabeled data to improve the accuracy and robustness of 3D point cloud semantic segmentation.",

The actor network is responsible for the determining the channel and power, and the critic network is responsible for the performance evaluation.",
        " GLOSSARY AND ABSTRACT: Geometric distortion caused by a refractive surface, as in a camera lens or an underwater imaging system, is a major factor affecting the image quality and any subsequent analysis. The method presented here is a distortion estimation based on an explicit modelling of the refractive surface, which, unlike previous methods relying on implicit models of distortion or calibration patterns, is based on the direct use of the physical properties of the refractive surface. We can therefore better deal with complex, non-uniform distortions than in the case of previous methods. The experimental results obtained on simulated and real images show that the accuracy and robustness of our method are superior to those of the previous ones, especially for scenes where the distortion is large and non-uniform. Moreover, the explicit modelling of the refractive surface gives valuable information about the optical system itself, thus facilitating the design and optimization of the lens.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of temporal consistency by comparing our method with existing unsupervised methods, and illustrating its utility by experiments on standard datasets. The key mechanism is to impose a temporal constraint on the resulting features by predicting their values from temporally adjacent frames. The experiments indicate the potential for exploiting temporal consistency as a tool for unsupervised learning, and we suggest that this may be a promising avenue for future research in this field.",
        " The present paper proposes a novel data-swap method within the deep-learning framework to speed up and enhance the accuracy of 3D medical image segmentation. Accurate and fast 3D medical image segmentation is crucial for a number of clinical applications, such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. However, the inherent complexity of volumetric data and the inherent difficulty of medical images usually make the development of accurate and fast methods difficult. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a multistage learning method. The first stage is to use a lightweight 3D convolutional neural network to segment the whole image, and then to strategically swap parts of the image between the training and the inference volume, thus enabling the network to focus on difficult regions, thus improving the accuracy of the segmentation without significantly increasing the time cost. Our experiments on the test sets of lumbar spine ct and brain mri data, which compare the Dice score and the Hausdorff distance, show that the inference speed of our method is much faster than that of state-of-the-art 3D methods..",

        " If you think that the problem of aligning Lidar point clouds is difficult, the point cloud of the model, which is on the plane of the cylinders, is no easier. Despite the progress of registration methods, it remains difficult to register point clouds of large areas and outdoor point clouds with significant noise and heterogeneous density. In this paper, we present HRegNet, a new hierarchical network for the registration of Lidar point clouds. It is based on a hierarchical feature extraction mechanism, which enables the network to capture context information at different scales and robustly estimate correspondences even in the presence of noise and outliers. In addition, a novel attention mechanism is incorporated to dynamically weigh features based on their importance for registration, which further improves the accuracy and robustness of the network. The experimental results show that the hierarchical architecture and attention mechanism can effectively cope with the difficulties of registering large outdoor point clouds.",
        " IT’S WELL KNOWN that the popular measures of accuracy in classification tasks are precision and recall. But these measures pose a significant challenge to time series analysis, with their temporal dependencies and variable definitions of positives. In this paper, we investigate how to apply precision and recall in time series contexts, with special emphasis on sensitivity to timing and nuanced definitions of true positives. We illustrate the benefits of these modified measures using several examples and demonstrate how they can be used to evaluate performance and select models for time series analysis. We discuss several different ways to define true positives in time series, considering factors such as windows, shifts, and similarity measures. We discuss how these choices of definitions impact the interpretation of precision and recall, and we propose a strategy for choosing the most appropriate evaluation framework given the task at hand. We then illustrate how to use these measures effectively in practice.",
        " Proper road extraction is an important problem for ITS, AV, and AGI. We propose a novel solution to map roads in LiDAR images using a JDDM-net, which is a joint task dense dilated convolutional merging network. Densely connected and large convolutional layers promote feature reuse and mitigate gradient vanishing, and dilation convolutional layers expand the visual field and suppress vanishing gradients, thereby improving the accuracy of road extraction. The JDDM-net is a joint task network, which combines the road structure segmentation and the boundary detection, and combines the features learned by the two branches of the network to obtain a higher accuracy of road extraction. The experiments on the LDMI standard datasets show that the proposed JDDM-net outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of the precision of the structure, the boundary, and the overall road extraction.",

In this paper we present “Semantic Palette”, a novel method to guide scene generation by specifying the desired proportions of different classes of objects. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for different generative architectures and data sets. In particular, the method uses a semantically segmented image as a “palette” which allows a person to specify the proportion of each class in a scene. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Semantic Palette in data augmentation and scene manipulation.",
        " Semantic concepts like who and when are difficult to connect with vehicle data, which often have a very complex spatio-temporal structure. In this paper, we present a new approach for natural language based vehicle searching using a new type of transformers that combine the semantics of the natural language with the complex spatio-temporal structure of the vehicle data. We evaluate our approach on a challenging vehicle searching task and show significant improvements over the best state-of-the-art results. Our approach allows us to learn rich and contextualized representations for both language and vehicle data, and enables us to map the complex spatio-temporal relations between language, vehicle, and time.",
        " This paper proposes a new building block of the neural network, the fully steerable spherical neuron. Using spherical harmonics, this neuron is capable of representing and processing 3D signals mapped on the sphere and therefore enables a rotationally equivariant feature extraction. This neuron can also be used to extract features from a 3D point cloud, achieving superior performance to existing methods in both accuracy and robustness. The proposed neuron is very different from the previous approaches that have used fixed orientations or limited steerability. It allows the orientation and the receptive field to be controlled independently and continuously, thus enabling learning of more flexible 3D features. The proposed architecture provides a powerful and flexible tool for learning and processing 3D data, which could pave the way for more efficient and interpretable 3D neural networks.",
        " Convolutional traces, which are usually unique to the images, are here extracted to identify the deepfakes. Deepfakes, artificial images created by means of deep learning, are a threat to information security. However, they are not without inconsistencies. We argue that the particular convolutional operations used by the deepfake-creating models such as GANs create particular statistical patterns and anomalies in the frequency domain, which are not found in the real images. Our method is based on... a specific convolutional neural network, a frequency analysis, a novel statistical measure, etc. to identify and amplify these convolutional traces. Our method is demonstrated on different deepfake image datasets, and, by means of extensive experiments, it shows that it has a higher detection performance than existing methods, and that it is also effective when it is combined with common post-processing techniques. This work is thus a contribution to the development of robust and reliable deepfake detection systems, by exploiting the inherent flaws of convolutional generative models.",
        " The knowledge of the environment surrounding the car from a bird's-eye view is of fundamental importance for the development of self-driving vehicles. The present work introduces a novel method for the processing of point clouds, which takes advantage of both geometric and semantic information in the point cloud data to obtain accurate and robust bird's-eye view semantic segmentation. The point cloud is projected onto the bird's-eye view plane, and then a multi-stage branching architecture is used to process geometric features (such as the height and the density of the cloud) and semantic features (derived from trained models of segmentation of point clouds) simultaneously. Geometric and semantic features are fused in the bird's-eye view plane, enabling the network to use both spatial context and class-dependent information. Experiments on a variety of datasets have shown that the fusion of geometric and semantic features significantly improves the performance of the proposed method.",
        " This paper presents a new method for generating normal maps from sketches using geometrical sampling. Previous methods based on freehand sketches often lack the ability to deal with the complex details of the surfaces and maintain consistency with the sketch. We introduce a smoothing method which, by preserving sharpness and noise, enables the construction of a dense point cloud of the surface. We extract key geometrical features from the sketch such as line density and curvature, and apply these features to the sampling. This produces a dense point cloud which can be used to calculate local surface normals. In this way, our method can create high-quality normal maps, and our method can realistically reconstruct a 3D model from a sketch, making a 3D content creation tool that can be easily used. The experiments show that the method produces high-quality normal maps with greater geometrical accuracy and detail than existing methods.",
        " The two-stage GAN based on the cooperation between the two generation nodes, which use the cooperative learning method, and produce images with two nodes. One node generates the structure of the image, and the other node adds details to the structure. This is the first time the GAN network is used to generate images. The two-stage GAN is able to create more diverse and realistic images. We have carried out extensive experiments on various standard image datasets to verify the effectiveness of GAN image generation. We have also carried out extensive experiments on the use of GAN images for data augmentation. These experiments show that GAN can not only generate good images, but also can effectively augment the quality of images.",
        " We consider the question of how to discover linguistic structure from unannotated data, based on a combination of alignment-based methods.

The results also show that this approach can produce a natural and scalable method for learning linguistic structure.",
        " This paper presents a new method for recognizing and following semantic 3D objects, while moving through a scene. We use the semantic segmentation of the surrounding environment to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the detection and tracking of 3D objects. Robust and accurate perception of the environment is essential for the development of an unmanned driving machine. Our method uses stereo depth data to produce accurate 3D object positions, and we show that the accuracy of the estimation of the motion of the robot is improved by combining the estimation of the position of the objects and the estimation of the motion of the robot. During this joint estimation of the position of the object and the speed of the robot, the performance of the system is improved.",
        " In this paper, we propose a new approach to tabular data. This approach combines the advantages of decision trees and neural networks for the purpose of improving performance on tabular data. Deep learning has made great progress in various areas of knowledge, but is still underdeveloped in its application to tabular data. On tabular data, neural networks can be outperformed by traditional methods such as gradient boosting machines. I have named the method NN+Dec. It consists of a tree of neural networks. Each tree uses the feature obtained by the neural network as the input feature, so it can effectively use gradient-based optimization. We show in a comprehensive experimental study that NN+Dec gives a significant performance improvement over both the boosting methods and the deep learning approaches that have been proposed for tabular data.",
        " Unlike the other methods which require the calculation of the blur-curve as a preliminary, and usually difficult step, we learn the mapping directly from the low-resolution to the high-resolution patches. In this paper we propose a simple method of blind super-resolution without the estimation of the blur-curve, which has the advantage of a high accuracy, and, by a suitable method of searching, also the blur-curve. We have tested the method on some tests, and have obtained results superior to those of the other methods in the order of PSNR and perceptual quality. The method is extremely simple, and allows the employment of a simple numerical calculation, as well as a practical adaptation to the SR procedures used in practice.",
        " This paper proposes a novel architecture that effectively learns features from point clouds, which uses the concept of homotopy equivalence to learn more robust and discriminative features from different features. The main feature of the PointShuffleNet is that, given the non-Euclidean and unordered nature of the point cloud, it is possible to exploit the mutual information of all the different channels to learn more discriminative features. The framework also uses homotopy equivalence to make the neural network learn the invariance of point clouds, and at the same time, the mutual information between the input and the learned features can be guaranteed to be effective. On the other hand, the network is encouraged to learn homotopy equivalence to make the learned features more invariant to deformation and more related to the topological structure of the point cloud. The performance on some well-known datasets is compared, and it is achieved that PointShuffleNet has achieved the excellent results.",
        " Deep-PDF (Deep Probability Density Form) is a method of modeling the probability density directly in three dimensions. It can be used to create a probabilistic, densified surface for shape reconstruction and manipulation. Deep-PDF is compared to existing methods, and shows greater robustness, flexibility and ability to handle complex topologies. Deep-PDF is used to both optimize the surface, by moving the points toward the denser areas, and to estimate the density, thus providing a continuous surface model. We show the effectiveness of Deep-PDF through experiments on various datasets. We show how to recreate surfaces from incomplete and noisy data, how to create smooth and plausible shapes, and how to offer a flexible and powerful tool for various tasks involving the surface.",
        " The authors present a classification of the methods of similarity between MDPs, according to the aspects of the process that they use (state space, action space, transition probabilities, rewards) and the mathematical principles that they use (distance, information, spectral). The Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the basic modeling tool for decision making under uncertainty. Developing methods that can exploit similarities between different MDPs offers the potential of improved efficiency in learning, transferring of knowledge, and robust decision making. Organizing and analyzing the landscape of MDP similarity metrics, this work aims to facilitate the development of more effective and efficient methods to solve complex sequential decision problems. This taxonomy includes existing and possibly new similarity metrics, providing a structured framework for evaluating their advantages and disadvantages, and the applicability of each one to different types of problems. Finally, the theoretical properties of these metrics are discussed, in particular their sensitivity to noise, their complexity, and the possibility of generalization.",
        " This paper introduces a new architecture that represents videos in a new way by combining the information from the surrounding regions, the concept of which is explained here. The mechanism used is [e.g. attention] to create more robust representations of the content. Their evaluation was conducted on a set of videos, comparing it with the state of the art on benchmarking videos. Our model learned to encode the semantic similarity and temporal relationship by comparing positive and negative pairs of videos. We also use a contrastive learning method to effectively separate the relevant and irrelevant videos from each other. It is concluded that the combination of these two approaches is very effective in learning the discriminative representation of the videos and, in turn, in improving the performance of the video retrieval.",
        " LGN, a system for generating scene graphs, which were begun to solve the problem of how to draw the objects of an image as a graph of relations, in the space, is designed to represent an image in the form of a graph, which contains the boxes of the objects, their labeling and relations, and the average density of the trees which compose them. The model takes into account the changes of the color of the tree and the order of the ellipses. This paper focuses on the generation of scene graphs in the absence of complete annotated data, with the goal of obtaining less biased models. The intrinsic bias of the models of scene graph generation is analyzed, which arises from the limited or noisy training of the data, in particular the prediction of predicates and the dependence of the object on its features. To eliminate these biases, we use a novel learning strategy that uses... [insert key words here, such as counterfactual reasoning, adversarial learning, self-supervision, etc.] [H] shows that our approach significantly improves the performance of scene graph generation models in an unannotated or weakly supervised setting. The model has a smaller bias for object classes and predicates, thereby increasing the generalization of the model. [H].",
        " Single-image depth estimation (SIDE) is a challenging task, and its practical implementation is often hindered by the lack of large-scale, accurately labeled real-world datasets. Nevertheless, training on synthetic data might offer a solution, but the gap between synthetic and real images would result in a severely compromised performance on real data. In this paper, we introduce T2Net, a translation network for SIDE tasks, which seeks to minimize this gap by learning on synthetic data and then translating to real data. Experiments on three different standard datasets show that T2Net significantly improves the performance of SIDE models trained on synthetic data when applied to real-world images. We use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to translate synthetic images to a realistic-looking image while preserving depth-related image structures. We design a novel loss function which combines adversarial loss, perceptual loss, and depth-sensitive structural similarity (DSSIM) loss to ensure both the realism of images and the preservation of depth-related structures. We show that our method reduces the domain gap and allows for a more accurate and robust estimation of depth from a single image.",
        " “This paper presents a new dynamic vision system for robust extraction of road lane indicators from dynamic vision sensors. Dynamic vision sensors offer the advantage of operation in high speed and challenging light conditions. However, the data format of dynamic vision sensors poses unique challenges to traditional image processing methods. Our method is demonstrated on challenging DVS data, where it outperforms existing event-based and image-based methods. The neural network explicitly learns the geometry of road lane indicators and enforces the geometric constraints during feature learning, enabling it to effectively filter out noise and extract accurate lane indicators from the sparse and asynchronous event data generated by DVS. Our results show that combining the advantages of DVS with the structure-awareness of deep learning will enable the use of dynamic vision systems for future ADAS and fully automatic driving.",
        " A new method of identifying timed segments in a given scene, from a description of a text, is proposed. It uses, as a training set, only pairs of images and text without temporal annotation. Specifically, we propose a novel architecture which, from the textual query, is able to focus attention on the relevant parts of the image. It thus discovers, by itself, the temporal relationships between text and image. We then use a discriminative learning method which induces it to learn to distinguish relevant from irrelevant. The result shows the promise of weakly supervised learning for temporal indexing, and suggests the possibility of practical applications. The experimental results obtained on standard data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method, giving results comparable with those obtained with supervised learning methods, but without the costs of annotation.",

The performance of FusiformNet has been evaluated on several facial recognition datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results, and demonstrating the superiority of the detail level to the whole level. It also shows the importance of capturing features at different levels for robust facial recognition, and it also proves the effectiveness of FusiformNet.",
        " Wasserstein Distance (WDM) measures the dependence between learned features. This paper proposes a Wasserstein Dependency Measure for learning neural representations. We show that WDM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art regularization methods. WDM's own distances can be used as a regularization criterion. By minimizing WDM during learning, we encourage the learned representation to capture the dependencies of the inputs while reducing spurious correlations. We believe WDM is a robust and computationally efficient way to learn representations that are inherently consistent with data dependencies.",

A key innovation is a phoneme-to-pose dictionary, which is used to map phonemes to facial poses, enabling accurate lip synchronization and natural head movements. From our experiments, we find that the method is effective in generating videos with accurate lip synchronization, and that the system is able to capture the personality of the person speaking. We can apply this to a variety of applications in telephony, virtual assistance, and content creation. We also apply the phoneme-to-pose dictionary to a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce high-resolution images.",
        " This paper is a survey of three-dimensional image segmentation methods. Three-dimensional ultrasonography provides volumetric information for many clinical applications, such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. However, the inherent properties of ultrasonography, such as low contrast, blur, and shadow artifacts, make accurate and robust segmentation a challenging and difficult task. This paper provides a survey of three-dimensional image segmentation methods, including their strengths and weaknesses for different anatomical structures and ultrasonographic modalities, as well as the common metrics and public data sets used for the evaluation of their performance. In this paper, we classified and analyzed the existing methods based on their underlying principles, including traditional methods, such as thresholding, region growing, and deformable models, and new methods that take advantage of deep learning, in particular convolutional neural networks. As for the future development of three-dimensional image segmentation, we pointed out the challenges, as well as the opportunities, to the field, emphasizing the need for robust, automatic, and clinically meaningful methods to achieve the full potential of three-dimensional ultrasonography.",
        " Minibatch SGD is a major pillar of modern machine learning, but its convergence speed can be seriously affected by the amount of random noise introduced by minibatch samples. This paper introduces a new data sampling method called “Typicality Sampling” to accelerate minibatch SGD. Instead of randomly sampling points for each minibatch, Typicality Sampling favors the most typical points from the data distribution, as measured by the likelihood under a learned density. We present a practical implementation of Typicality Sampling with an efficient estimation method for the data distribution, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of minibatches, models, and data sets. Empirical results show that Typicality Sampling outperforms uniform sampling in both convergence speed and final accuracy, especially on noisy and skewed data distributions. This paper shows a promising way of improving the efficiency and accuracy of minibatch SGD.",

        " In this paper we propose a Dynamic Refinement Neural Network (DRN) to improve the accuracy of the localization and orientation of oriented and densely-packed objects. Detecting oriented and densely-packed objects poses significant challenges because of their mutual overlap, their various orientations, and the difficulty in predicting the proper properties of their bounding boxes. We have devised a new loss function, which focuses on a combination of the errors in localization and orientation, and thus enables a more robust performance on densely-packed images. The neural network is equipped with a dynamic refinement mechanism that automatically learns to adapt the receptive fields and feature aggregation in accordance with the characteristics of objects. Consequently, the neural network is able to effectively deal with overlapping objects and to precisely predict their orientations. Our experiments on standard datasets show that the DRN achieves a better performance than existing methods.",

        " * This paper presents BRPO, a new batch reinforcement learning method that employs the idea of learning residual policies. It consists in learning the residual policy, that is, a policy added to the existing policy, which is in fact not the most accurate one, without requiring any interaction with the environment. Specifically, BRPO uses a policy improvement operator that is based on the estimation of the value of the performance advantage, derived from the batch data. The main contribution is a regularized objective that encourages the learned residual policy to remain near the current policy, which avoids the excessive deviation from it and increases the robustness. Instead of learning the policy directly from scratch, BRPO is more concerned with learning only a small correction to the current policy, which stabilizes the learning process and increases the sampling efficiency. The results of the experiments show that BRPO is able to effectively use the batch data to learn a better policy without requiring any online exploration.",
        " A de-biased method of learning a sparse partial linear model, in a very high-dimensional setting where the number of features is larger than the sample size, is the subject of this paper. For in this setting the local biases introduced in the estimation and aggregation of the model are so significant that the performance of the model may be seriously degraded. Our approach combines the local estimation of the model using a penalty to induce sparsity with a de-biasing step to remove the biases introduced in the local estimation and the distributed aggregation. We show the consistency and asymptotic normality of our de-biased distributed estimator under suitable conditions on the sparsity level and the distribution of the features. Our method is also demonstrated on simulated and real data, where it outperforms existing methods in bias removal and estimation accuracy.",
        " TGNs have been introduced as a powerful tool to represent the dynamic relations between elements of a system. However, the resulting embeddings have suffered from the difficulties of discerning complex temporal relations, and they are susceptible to biases introduced by the identity of the nodes. This paper presents a novel approach to the embedding of TGNs based on causal anonymous walks. We train a node embedding by learning the walk. This effectively captures the temporal dynamics and causal dependencies of the graph. We also employ causal inference techniques to extract and reduce the influence of confounding factors in the transitions of the walks, resulting in an improved representation of the causality of the nodes. Finally, we conduct experiments on three standard data sets. Our results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing TGN embedding methods on tasks of prediction, classification and anomaly detection.",
        " Existing self-supervised learning methods are unreliable in the face of objects that move independently, resulting in inaccurate predictions of depth and pose. To solve this problem, we introduce an Attentional Separation and Aggregation network (ASAnet) for self-supervised depth and pose estimation. With a combination of separation and aggregation, we can capture more of the reliable, static information in the scene. Specifically, we first use an attentional separation module to recognize and separate the features that may belong to dynamic objects, and then use a context aggregation module to choose and aggregate the features from the regions that remain static, thus reducing the impact of dynamic objects. This approach provides a promising way for self-supervised learning in the face of complex real-world scenes. In experiments on challenging dynamic scene datasets, the performance of ASAnet is evaluated and compared with existing self-supervised learning methods.",
        " Image object detection and segmentation methods that aim to recognize and label objects without prior knowledge of the objects' identity, employing models adapted to a general data set to be used for the detection of objects unknown to them. Zero-shot learning involves the re-use of networks trained on large, well-defined datasets for object detection and semantic segmentation, which have to generalize to objects they have never encountered before. These problems are addressed by recent research in terms of visual and semantic mappings, robust strategies for object segmentation, and how to bridge the domain gap between training and testing data. This paper discusses the issue of zero-shot learning, focusing on its key problem of transferring knowledge from related tasks and its ability to revolutionize the use of object recognition in circumstances where the number of labelled images is small or even non-existent.",
        " Having accomplished the creation of a large variety of high-quality data with a simple procedure, Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) have become an important data generation tool. Despite their great success, evaluating GANs is still a major challenge. The aim of this paper is to propose an improved evaluation framework for GANs that can overcome the above difficulties. Our framework combines a novel combination of metrics, including... (such as a refined version of the Inception score, a distribution distance measure and a diversity metric), aiming to achieve a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of GANs. We show the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets, showing that it is more discriminating between models with different generative capabilities and that it converges closer to human visual evaluation. We conclude that our framework is a useful tool for both research and industry in the GAN community, enabling more accurate and meaningful evaluations of generative models.",
        " In recent years, many graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed that are very successful in learning from graph data, but the architectures of most of these GNNs neglect the significance and similarity of the edges, which results in a limitation of the model in capturing complex relationships and propagating information. We propose an Edge Similarity Aware Graph Neural Network (ES-GNN), which can learn to dynamically influence the neighbor node based on the similarity of the connecting edge, so that the GNN can effectively extract the characteristics of the node from the similar edges, which in turn makes the node learn a better representation of the graph. The experimental results on several well-known graph data sets show that the performance of ES-GNN is superior to that of conventional GNNs, and even achieves the state-of-the-art in some tasks such as node classification and graph classification.. The structure of similarity between edges is introduced, and different methods for calculating similarity between edges are discussed.",

These results demonstrate the ability of this type of model to produce powerful and versatile cross-modality models, capable of learning effectively complex relationships between the different representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TxT on several cross-modal tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering, obtaining good or best-in-class results.",
        " GRiNN has had great success in learning to represent the nodes in the given network, and the common assumption underlying its success is that homophily, the resemblance between the features and labels of connected nodes, influences the choice of GRiNN architectures, which make a difference in the node labels. This paper deals with the dependence of the GRiNN on the homophily degree of the network, and it examines the performance of the GRiNN architectures on synthetic and real data with different homophily degrees, which are obtained by manipulating the network in a controlled way. However, it is unknown how homophily is necessary for the performance of the GRiNN. This paper reveals that homophily in general is a benefit for GRiNN performance, but that heterophily can be a reasonable performance in some cases. It also reveals that relying on homophily alone can have a bad effect, because the network is overly smoothed and there are limitations in capturing complex relationships. This paper suggests new strategies for learning in heterophilic graphs.",
        " The ball-like hyperbolic spaces, because of the limits of their geometrical representations, often fail to represent the complexity of hierarchical structures. The proposed model, the ball, takes advantage of the inherent properties of the complex hyperbolic space, namely its structure and its curvature, to create a better representation and an exacter characterization of hierarchical structures. Through a thorough comparison of its performance on both synthetic and real data, the authors demonstrate that the proposed ball model outperforms the existing hyperbolic models both in the quality of the representation and in the speed of its execution. The proposed model allows the efficient calculation of distances and similarities between nodes, which enable the development of a new method of characterization and analysis of the hierarchy.",
        " Many geometric properties of the smallest scale cannot be detected by a single neighborhood search, and a deep learning model was introduced to combine two neighboring methods to improve the results of a single neighborhood search. In this paper, a new deep neural network called Dual-neighbor Deep Fusion (DNDF) is proposed for the fusion of two neighbors, and to solve the problem of multiple scales, this paper presents the following two types of neighborhoods: 1) K-nearest neighbors, the most accurate neighborhoods; 2) radial neighborhoods, to capture information. The two types of neighborhoods are processed in parallel in separate branches of the network, and the two feature extraction methods are separated from each other. The two branches are merged together with a deep fusion layer to enhance the complementary information of the two branches. The effectiveness of DNDF on challenging point cloud classification and segmentation tasks is evaluated with two experiments on the standard models of the world, the ModelNet40 and the ShapeNetPart.",
        " By using deep learning methods, it is now possible to obtain good results in hyperspectral image classification. However, to learn the fine relationships between the spectrum and the context is still a problem, so the authors present a new Spectral-Spatial Graph Reasoning Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification. SSGRN. It extracts spectral-spatial features from the spectral images and then uses a graph reasoning unit to iteratively propagate and aggregate information across the graph, enabling the network to learn the contextualized representations. Testing on several spectral image datasets, the proposed SSGRN outperforms existing methods and shows that it can capture the complex spectral-spatial dependencies. Finally, the enriched spectral-spatial features are fed into the neural network's classification layer to predict the land cover.",
        " This paper examines the role of geometry in active learning for both two-class and multi-class image segmentation. Active learning (AL) aims to minimize the amount of work required to label features by identifying the most informative ones for annotation. Active learning is a labeling technique which allows only the most informative features to be labeled. We propose new learning functions which use geometric information extracted from initial model predictions to prioritise data points for annotation. We evaluate our approach on two-class and multi-class image data sets and show that including geometric information improves the performance of the method, allowing fewer images to be labeled than with uncertainty-based and random sampling methods. Our results show the importance of combining geometric information with AL in order to improve the performance of image segmentation.",

Its core is a hierarchical approach, which decomposes a complex task into a number of simpler stages and allows agents to focus on particular goals within each stage. In addition, a communication protocol is proposed to support information sharing and cooperative decision making. We evaluate CM3 on a challenging simulated environment and demonstrate its superiority over existing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods with respect to success rates, scalability, and efficiency. We also propose a novel reinforcement learning framework to motivate agents and encourage them to explore the environment efficiently, by rewarding actions that are compatible with the overall goal of the team. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical structure, reward shaping, and communication protocol in enabling the agents to learn complex cooperative strategies for a multi-stage, multi-goal task.",
        " Then they gave their consent, and a pact was made between the party of two, which went by the name of “Willing Cowards”. Neural networks are fast in learning complex patterns, but they often lack the efficiency and interpretability of rule-based systems, especially when relevant features interact sparsely. It has been shown that a neural network with rules can achieve competitive performance compared to a neural network with hidden units derived from rule induction. These rules are then embedded as hidden units within a neural network, enabling the network to efficiently identify and exploit the important feature combinations, while maintaining a degree of transparency.",
        " This paper addresses this deficiency by presenting a 3D MOT baseline based on an established detection-based framework that uses state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. While there is significant progress in this area, the literature is lacking a standardized evaluation procedure and a robust framework for evaluating 3D MOT. We evaluate our 3D MOT baseline on a publicly available dataset, giving a good comparison point for future work and highlighting the areas that require the most improvement. We also present a set of novel metrics that are specifically tailored to the task of 3D MOT. These metrics, such as localization accuracy, orientation estimation and consistency of trajectories, are more granular and thus more informative than the metrics used in previous work. We hope that by providing a strong reference and a refined evaluation framework, our work will foster further progress in 3D MOT.",

        " The second method, known as convolutional autoencoding, is to add several convolutional layers with different resolutions, in order to obtain an accurate and more complete feature description. The resulting network is able to learn invariant features, which are useful for the reconstruction of images, the extraction of features, and the detection of irregularities. The resulting network, by means of successive downsamplings and upsamplings, maintains the convolutional connection at each resolution. We test this network on several standard images, demonstrating a substantial improvement in quality and the dissociation of the features with respect to those of the ordinary convolutional autoencoding and other dimensionality reduction methods. We highlight the ability of the multi-resolution method to learn a more complete and informative representation of images.",
        " This work introduces a novel control variate, which is a modification of Stein’s identity, specifically designed for policy learning and using Stein’s identity to obtain more accurate gradients. The control variate is conditioned on the agent’s actions and thus enables more precise estimation of the policy gradient by exploiting the relationship between action distributions and the underlying reward function. It is shown that the new control variate reduces the uncertainty in the estimated policy gradient, and its empirical performance on a set of standard reinforcement learning tasks is illustrated, showing that the benefit of including information about actions in the control variate framework is very high. Our method provides a principled way to build control variates without the need for explicit function approximation or complex auxiliary models.",
        " fairness-aware heuristic tree : fairness-aware heuristic tree is a classification system that can detect unfairnesses in data and can omit them while maintaining its competitive accuracy. Decision tree classifiers are widely used because of their efficiency and interpretability. However, the discrimination of the right of discrimination is not considered in the use of decision trees, which may lead to discrimination against protected groups. At the same time, it is difficult to achieve a high classification accuracy with a fairness-aware classifier. A fairness-aware heuristic is a classifier that can dynamically adjust the splitting criteria with the observed fairness impact at each node, and thus can reduce the unfairness of the data, but still maintain the classification accuracy. The results of the experiments on the benchmark data showed that the discrimination degree in the classifier was significantly reduced without significant loss of accuracy. A promising tool for building fair and dependable decision-making systems.",
        " This paper introduces a new method of determining probability distributions by the union of a stable autoregressive procedure and the score matching method. Score matching, a powerful method for obtaining unnormalized probabilities, is a cumbersome operation in high dimensions, and therefore difficult to carry out. This new method, based on a dividing of the joint probability into a product of its several conditional probabilities, is shown to be more effective than the older score matching methods in determining the probabilities of a complex distribution. It is also faster.",
        " Introducing Boundary-seeking Generative Adversarial Nets (BS-GANs), a novel training approach of Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), focusing on sharpening the discriminant boundaries between the generated and real images, thus avoiding mode-collapse and generating samples that fit well with the discriminant boundary. We also present a stable learning scheme that ensures the stability of the learning and ensures that the generator does not only produce adversarial examples that fool the discriminator, but also improves the quality of the generated images. Experimental results on various standard data sets have shown that BS-GANs achieve significant improvements in image quality, diversity and training stability compared to the existing GANs. Moreover, the proposed method is stable and can be used in applications.",
        " It is the aim of the work to produce a method of automatic segmentation of the objects which move in a sequence of pictures. The methods proposed are based on one of the most usual kinds of approach, either the forward or the backward one. The purpose of the present work is to combine the two by a new recurrent neural system, which, operating simultaneously in both directions, combines the resulting segmentation masks obtained from the two approaches, by a fusion guided by a mechanism of confidence which is proportionate to the degree of reliability of each stream. Our approach exploits the advantage of each of these two directions: the forward propagation gives a very robust track and well handles occlusions; the backward propagation corrects the errors and gives future contexts to the boundary of the objects. Consequently, our method is very effective in overcoming the obstacles encountered by the state-of-the-art methods. The results obtained on the VOSTM datasets demonstrate that the combination of these two strategies gives us a greater accuracy in more difficult situations.",
        " Having noted that tabular data are frequently created in a centralized fashion, we devise a method of obtaining tabular data which is a copy of the original and which is called a federated table, and which we call Fed-TGAN. We experimented on several tables, showing that the simulated table has a high correspondence with the original table and that this method greatly reduces the risks of leakage. The client carries out the training on his own private data and only shares with a central server the resulting statistical information and the number of simulated table records. As we have seen, Fed-TGAN is a solution for producing tabular data which is a copy of a sensitive table.",
        " Hence, a better method is needed to study the rewards which he will receive. This paper proposes a new method of inverse reinforcement learning, in which the prediction of the value of the rewards depends on the expert's policy. Our method can thus better capture the peculiarities of the expert's actions, and can learn a more accurate and robust reward function than the methods based on trajectories alone. It has been tested on various test data, and the results show that by including explicit estimates of the expert's policy, it is possible to obtain more accurate and reliable rewards.",
        " To do this, we use a multiscale feature extraction method based on a DWT3D decomposition of the PolSAR image. This method reveals textural and structural details at different resolutions. Then we take advantage of the complementary properties of the Markov random field (MRF) and a hierarchical classification method to carry out semantic segmentation. The MRF model consists of a data term that consists of the DWT features and a smoothness term that encourages the homogeneity of the label in the neighboring polaroids. The obtained results on real PolSAR images show the effectiveness of the proposed method by providing a better accuracy of segmentation compared to state-of-the-art methods. This is a result of the use of the spatial context of polarization and the decomposition of PolSAR images into multiscale features.",
        " This paper proposes a content-based communication approach for cooperative LiDAR object detection. Cooperative LiDAR object detection increases the object perception of a cooperative system, especially in the difficult environment. But sharing the raw LiDAR point cloud is very bandwidth-consuming, thereby preventing real-time deployment. The communication of the content-based approach does not directly transmit the point cloud, but rather uses a feature extraction and communication method based on the current bandwidth. We use a new feature selection method that takes into account the importance and redundancy of the features, thereby enabling a more accurate feature transmission with the available bandwidth. We can also robustly and efficiently perceive the environment in a bandwidth-constrained environment. The experimental results on the simulation of cooperative driving with a road map show that our method can significantly reduce the communication load compared to sharing the raw point cloud, and the object detection performance can be maintained or improved compared to the original data in the low-bandwidth situation.",
        " This paper presents a framework that learns to represent desired states or behaviors through a set of interpretable subgoals, which is then used to guide exploration and to provide explanations of the agent's actions. We use these subgoals to define intrinsic rewards that encourage the agent to explore various and useful areas of the environment. We show that the method is effective in complex environments and leads to better exploration, more learning, and more explainability, as compared to existing heuristic and explainable methods. In addition, the learned subgoals form a natural foundation for explanations, as the agent's actions and reasoning are naturally expressed in terms of the subgoals that it has learned. These results suggest that interpretable subgoals can be used as a powerful tool to develop more intelligent, more transparent, and more trustworthy agents.",
        " Hence, in this paper, we propose an efficient method of selecting the nodes of a learning model, by employing graph centrality measures. We hypothesize that, by identifying those nodes whose importance and coherence are most important in the graph, the learning model will learn more rapidly and yield better generalization than random or uniform sampling. This paper offers a general framework for selecting training nodes in graphs, which has a potential for various applications in social networks, recommendation systems and bioinformatics. We evaluate the proposed method with different graph centrality measures, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, etc., in a variety of benchmarks and compared them with traditional methods. Our results show that the learning time is reduced by the nodes of graph centrality and that the accuracy of the model is improved, thereby demonstrating the efficiency of our method.",
        " (Abstract) We study the design and performance of a new class of convolutional network, called a flood-filling network, that operates in a novel manner, namely by flooding from each seed location in an image. The water of this network, propagating towards its neighbors, gradually turns them into segmented regions whose sizes are automatically learned from their neighborhood. This process mimics the natural propagation of information, which results in a segmentation of regions which is coherent and integrated with its environment. This article explains the main principles of the flood-filling network, showing their advantages over pixel-wise methods, and their application to many image processing problems, including those of biomedical images and visual scene understanding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the flood-filling network by presenting its implementation and its evaluation on the famous datasets, demonstrating its ability to obtain accurate and coherent results. The flood-filling network is especially suited to the most difficult tasks, in which the borders of the objects are ambiguous or noisy, since its progressive recombination allows for a correction of errors and a unified description of features.",
        " In the Introduction to Coupling Depth Learning, it is stated that Coupling Depth Learning involves the application of deep learning to two or more distinct data domains or problems. It makes it possible to combine the information and representations of these domains by a variety of methods, such as shared layers, shared loss, shared attention, and the adversarial method. This article introduces the concept of Coupling Depth Learning, and the main principles and potential advantages for solving complex, multi-problem tasks in a wide variety of applications, such as multi-mode learning, transfer learning and multi-task learning. The advantages of coupling depth learning include better generalization, especially in low-intensity situations, more robust to noise and variability across domains, and the ability to transfer knowledge from the more complete domain to the less complete one.",
        " # [Abstract] - Two-view structure-from-motion (SfM) is the task of recovering the scene geometry from a sequence of images. While in the traditional SfM pipelines features are extracted by hand and geometric estimation is carried out robustly, in recent years deep learning has shown great promise in learning the entire process of feature extraction and geometric estimation. This paper revisits the two-view SfM task with deep learning in order to improve its accuracy and robustness. Here we provide some new ideas: for example, we present a new estimation module, a novel loss function, and a robust matching strategy. We then discuss the shortcomings of current deep two-view SfM approaches, especially in terms of the ability to handle difficult tasks such as large view-distances, features without decomposition, and repeated features. We finally present a more complete and robust two-view SfM method. Through extensive experiments on several standard data sets, we show that our method is much better than the existing deep two-view SfM methods, with better accuracy and robustness.",
        " Semantic object detection is an important problem in visual object recognition. This paper introduces CLASS: a framework for salient object detection that makes use of attention mechanisms and multilevel supervision. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that CLASS is able to achieve the best results in terms of both accuracy and visual quality. We introduce a Cross-Level Attention Module (CLAM) that combines features from different levels of abstraction and makes them more salient, and suppresses the irrelevant noise in the background. We also adopt a multilevel supervision strategy to make sure that each of the layers in the network is fine-tuned to map better to the end result. And so we achieve better accuracy and more reliable saliency detection.",
        " “In the past, centralised systems have been used for text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), but this has caused concerns for data privacy. This paper introduces a new framework for TTS, which is based on a dynamic Transformer architecture. We use a dynamically tunable network for the transformation, enabling a flexible model adaptation and adaptation of the data distribution, thus accommodating the different characteristics of the data. We present experimental results that demonstrate that the performance of our dynamic transformer is comparable or superior to centralised systems when synthesising on a common test set, and that this can be achieved while ensuring the data privacy. The effectiveness of the flexibility in the transformer is evaluated in terms of personalisation and communication efficiency.",
        " This paper presents a novel method for classifying transient disturbances based on deep learning, by encoding phasor measurement unit data. The effective control and protection of the electrical system depend on the accurate and timely classification of the transient disturbances. It was found that a variety of methods could be used to encode the transient disturbances in the phasor measurement unit, which was better than directly using the phasor measurement unit data. Instead of directly inputting the PMU data, a time-series measure of the current and voltage of the phasor measurement unit was converted into a deep learning network, and a convolutional neural network was used to get the features. The image was obtained by the transformation of the input image and the output image. The performance of the proposed method was tested by simulating the data of the power system, and the results were promising.",
        " This paper presents an Edge-Cloud Object Detection Framework Using a Novel Difficult-Case Discriminator (DCD). The main purpose of this work is to partition the process of object detection in the edge device and the cloud, so as to overcome the challenges of dividing the detection process and reducing the communication overhead of the detection process. The result of the DCD analysis is to divide the input image into difficult and simple, and only those difficult images are sent to the cloud for accurate detection, while the simple images are processed locally on the edge. This intelligent distribution of data significantly reduces the communication overhead of the detection process, but also greatly improves the accuracy of detection. The proposed framework based on the DCD is an efficient and practical solution for real-time object detection in resource-limited environments. We have done extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework. We have shown that the latency of the test system is much smaller than the cloud and the edge device, and the accuracy of the test system is much higher than that of the cloud and the edge device, and the performance of the system is much better than that of the static offloading strategies.",
        " Despite the success of coordinate descent in solving small-to-medium sized problems, its performance is often unsatisfactory when dealing with large data sets due to bottlenecks in accessing the data and calculating model parameters. To address this problem, we study and adapt various methods of accelerating coordinate descent such as active sets, warm starts, and parallelization. Using extensive experiments on a large variety of datasets, we demonstrate that our method can drastically reduce the time needed to solve large L1-regularized problems, making it practical for use in practical applications. Our work shows that, with appropriate design choices, carefully crafted coordinate descent-like methods can outperform current state-of-the-art methods when dealing with large-scale sparse modeling problems.",
        " The method of this paper is to be derived from a physics experiment on which a ball rolling down a potential surface is introduced. The method takes the gradients of the image to define the slope of the incline, and, by means of an iterative process, simulates the motion of balls released at different points of the image. The balls thus converge towards the local minima of the gradients, indicating distinct regions of the image. We have examined this method with different images, proving its ability to delineate the contours of objects, and demonstrating its capacity to give satisfactory results for the separation of objects. It is possible to control the inertia and the velocity of the ball by means of adjustable parameters. The method, because of its simplicity and its flexibility, is a possible one for the solution of problems of image analysis.",
        " Abstract: VQA systems need to reason about images and text in order to come to an answer. Despite their impressive performance, current VQA systems often have difficulty generalizing to unseen question-answer distributions, suggesting a lack of robust reasoning. In this paper, we address the problem of explicitly supervising the transfer of reasoning patterns in VQA. A particular model is trained with supervision to help the model break down the problem into its constituent parts, learn these patterns, and transfer them to new situations. Our experiments show that the explicit supervision of the transfer of reasoning patterns leads to increased generalization to unseen data, especially when answering complex, compositional questions. The learned reasoning patterns also show the capability to capture semantic relationships and logical dependencies, leading to a more robust and explainable system.",
        " The analysis of data from different modalities, such as images, text and sound, often suffers from the high dimensionality and the specificity of the modalities. To address these problems, we propose an adaptive dimensionality reduction method, which identifies the most useful features by comparing the relevance of features in the same modalities and the relevance of features between different modalities. In this paper, we present a novel method of enhancing ensemble and transfer learning for multimodal data analysis by introducing the adaptive dimensionality reduction. In the ensemble learning, the reduced features are used to train a large number of base learners, and their individual performance is improved, thus improving the ensemble diversity. In the transfer learning, the reduced features are used to train a number of base learners, which improves individual learners and ensemble diversity. Dimensionality reduction is dynamically adjusted during both the ensemble and the transfer learning stages. Our experiments on a number of multimodal data sets show that our method can significantly improve the performance of classification and other tasks. It can be shown that the method is effective in combining the advantages of ensemble and transfer learning for multimodal data analysis.",
        " But, though this model greatly facilitates the composition of images with corresponding captions, it does not improve the accuracy of the captions. Moreover, a problem is pointed out that it does not yield any literal picture of the whole image. On the contrary, the image is captured by a particular part of the image. Having developed this method, we would like to develop an explicit means of focusing the attention of the encoder to some point in the image. We will also be interested in the possibilities of this model for displaying, encoding, and searching for images.",
        " A precise and detailed classification of medical reports is essential for many downstream tasks such as clinical decision support, billing, research and the like. Accurate and detailed classification of medical reports is difficult, because of privacy concerns and the need for human expert knowledge. We introduce a novel semi-supervised classification method for medical reports. Our method exploits the inherent ambiguity in medical reports and learns from the unlabelled as well as the labelled reports. Our method exploits the fine semantic distinctions within the text of the medical reports and supports detailed and accurate classifications across different clinical categories. The potential of semi-supervised learning for addressing the data-scarcity problem in medical report classification is shown. We also present experimental results on a real-world dataset, demonstrating that our semi-supervised method significantly outperforms supervised methods trained on a limited amount of labelled reports. The performance of our semi-supervised method is close to that of fully supervised methods, using significantly less labelled data.",
        " - Mathematical theory of attention. This paper presents a new mathematical theory of attention, which is a process of resource allocation and selection of information. This process is formalized with the help of concepts from information theory, dynamical systems and optimization theory. In this way, it is possible to describe a variety of attentional phenomena: selective attention, fixed attention, shifts of attention, by changing the structure and structure of the model. The proposed mathematical theory is justified by simulations and analytical results, which predict biases of attention, resource allocation strategies, and the effect of overloads on attentional performance. This paper presents a basis for a precise and quantitative understanding of attention and its role in intelligent systems. We consider the possibility of applying this mathematical model to improve artificial intelligence systems, in particular in the area of machine learning and natural language processing, by allowing them to allocate their resources more efficiently and to select more relevant information.",
        " Object tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, often approached through complex feature extraction, association, and motion modelling. This paper presents a simplified yet effective approach to object tracking, which represents objects as simple points. This paper is available at: We show the effectiveness of our “Tracking Objects as Points” approach on challenging real-world data sets, demonstrating competitive accuracy and superior speed compared to existing trackers. We introduce a novel framework, based on deep learning, to predict the centroids of objects in the two neighboring frames, and thus enable efficient tracking by linking points between frames according to the predicted shift. It is our contention that a simple point-based representation has a good potential for efficient and scalable object tracking in real-world applications.",
        " This paper explores the relationship between image classification and image coding. It is based on the study of the potential of image classification for influencing the process of encoding and decoding in order to improve the visual quality, reduce the memory cost and optimize the communication band. It proposes a new framework based on a deep learning image classification model and a series of optimized encoding and decoding methods. The experiments show that the quality of the images and the efficiency of the coding and decoding methods can be improved compared to the usual class-insensitive encoding and decoding methods, and the new method can be used to design intelligent and resource-aware image management systems.",
        " As the dimension of the input space is not fixed, but is changing from the input to the output, the ‘normalizing flow’ offers a powerful tool to learn complex probability distributions by successively applying an invertible mapping to a series of inputs.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on...

        " Numbering: This paper will explore the evolving relationship between realism and the concept of machine learning. This relationship, which has previously been linked to a faithful representation of the external world, is today being challenged and reformulated by the growing power and pervasiveness of ML. We will examine how ML can create hyperrealistic images, sounds, and text that muddy the boundaries between realism and simulation, and raise deep questions about the nature of perception, truth, and originality. This paper will argue that understanding the relationship between ML and realism is essential for addressing the ethical, aesthetic, and epistemological challenges of an increasingly algorithmic reality. We will also explore how ML, which draws on enormous data sets, is shaping our understanding of reality by influencing our information consumption, predictions, and even scientific discovery. Finally, we will discuss the potential for ML to both undermine the notion of realism as it is currently understood, but also to foster new forms of realism that express insights drawn from data and a complex, multi-perspective view of the world.",
        " Projective simulation is a biologically inspired architecture that uses recollection and imagination to guide action selection. Despite the promise of this architecture for learning from experience, there is a lack of understanding of its convergence properties for MDPs. Our analysis uses techniques from the theory of randomized approximation to bound the convergence rate of a specific PS-based policy. Our analysis is focused on identifying conditions on the structure of the MDP and the learning parameters for which guaranteed convergence to an optimum is guaranteed. We discuss the ramifications of our results for the design of practical PS-based RL agents, and suggest some avenues for future research into improving the convergence properties and scalability of such systems.",
        " This work deals with the application of self-supervised learning to document images, a subject rich in textual and visual information. It addresses a number of prediction tasks which exploit the internal characteristics of the domain: the prediction of the rotation of the image, the prediction of the context of a selected region, the restoration of damaged regions. Its main contribution is to show that, compared to the learning from scratch or by means of the ImageNet pre-trained weights, the pre-trained network shows a marked improvement in performance, and that self-supervised learning is an effective tool for learning the particular visual and textual features of document images. The model is then adapted to a variety of tasks of document classification, layout analysis and optical character recognition, and, after a preliminary evaluation on these tasks, the performance of the final network is measured. The study provides a valuable insight into the design and application of self-supervised learning for improving the understanding of document images.",
        " As generative models become more sophisticated, the visual realism of synthetic faces approaches that of real ones, so that we cannot tell them apart. We will examine how human beings perceive and process such ‘more real than real’ faces, and in particular how they perceive their attractiveness, trustworthiness, memorability, and emotional expression. This study investigates the human visual perception of synthetic faces, exploring the increasing indistinctness between reality and artificiality in image generation. These results will illuminate the mental mechanisms of facial recognition and interpretation, and help to clarify the ethical implications of the rise of advanced synthetic media in the realms of digital identity, social interaction, and manipulation. We will conduct a series of experiments to investigate the extent to which the subtle differences between synthetic and real faces affect the above-mentioned perceptions. We will also examine the effects of exposure to synthetic faces on our understanding of beauty standards and social cognition.",

The system is able to identify visual features which are of particular significance in the assessment of the adhesive properties of a copper surface. This system can be used to augment human expertise, and the information gathered can be shown to the expert, enabling insights into their own decision-making process, and to highlight visual features which they did not recognize as contributing significantly to their assessment.",

        " Friction welding is a solid state joining method widely used in the fabrication of aluminum alloys such as 6061. Friction welding requires that a wide range of process factors, such as welding speed, angular speed, and axial force, be controlled for a satisfactory weld. In this study, a supervised regression method is used to optimize the FSW process of 6061 with an emphasis on welding speed and angular speed. With the supervised regression method, we can optimize the welding speed and angular speed based on the measured tensile strength, hardness, and microstructure of the weld. The supervised regression model consists of a support vector machine (SVM), random forest regression (RFR), and artificial neural networks (ANN) and their performance is evaluated by a correlation coefficient, mean absolute error, and root mean square error. Thus, we can replace the previous trial-and-error method with the data-driven method, which reduces the number of experiments and accelerates the development of FSW processes.",
        " This paper re-examines the basic principles of graph neural networks, and argues that graph neural networks are essentially a low-pass filtering method for the graph signal. The wide variety of GNNs reveals an emerging common perspective, and we interpret them as a method of processing graph signals locally. We discuss the ramifications of this observation, discuss the limitations imposed by low-pass filtering, and suggest an alternative method of designing GNN architectures that can more effectively utilise high-frequency information without compromising robustness. The regularization inherent in graph neural network layers, based on spectral convolution and message passing, has an inherent smoothing effect on the graph features and suppresses the high-frequency information, which is essential for capturing the global graph structure and avoiding over-fitting, but may also restrict the sensitivity of GNNs in detecting nodes and structures based on high-frequency information. A clearer understanding of this inherent filtering mechanism in GNNs will inform the development of GNNs in the future.",
        " Instance segmentation aims to identify and segment individual objects in an image. A key challenge is the mismatch between the training and inference stages: during training, the sampling proposal is usually based on the ground truth, while in inference the proposal must be generated independently, which leads to performance degradation. This paper proposes SCNet, a new framework that explicitly addresses this mismatch between the training and inference stages by introducing a sample consistency loss. In particular, a common network is used to generate proposals during both stages, and a consistency loss is introduced to encourage the training proposals to be consistent with the inference proposals. Experimental results on two publicly available instances show that SCNet significantly outperforms existing methods, which highlight the effectiveness of explicitly addressing the mismatch between the training and inference samples. The network learns features that are more robust to variations in training proposals, and better generalizes to unseen data during inference.",
        " HE PAS method is a novel method for graph classification by pooling layers. Graph classification is an important problem in many areas. Graph neural networks have achieved good results, but designing an effective architecture, especially a pooling layer, which summarizes the network information, is a difficult task. HE PAS is a novel method for graph classification. It is a search method that explores a space of pooling functions with node features, network structure, and learnable parameters. It is expected that this search method can discover a large number of pooling layers that can fit the characteristics of different graphs. HE PAS has been tested on a variety of graph classification benchmarks, and it has achieved significant improvements in accuracy and generalization on a large number of benchmarks. It is an important step in the automation of graph neural network architecture design.",
        " In this paper, we present a new approach to the problem of identifying objects in forward-looking sonar images. The images obtained are of low resolution and contain a great deal of noise. The image acquisition system is based on a convolutional neural network. It is possible to use this network for the detection of a large number of classes of objects. The training is done using forward-looking sonar images. Using our system, a region with a high probability of containing an object can be detected and classified as an object, as well as a background object. The object can be selected from a number of possible objects. Objects are then classified as to the nature of the object. We also analyze the effect of different network architectures and different training strategies on the objectness scores of forward-looking sonar images.",
        " To explain the decision making process of a neural network is essential for building trust and for the deployment of responsible systems. Existing explanation methods focus on single input features or layers, which cannot provide insights into the interplay of the network’s overall activity. In this paper, we present YASENN, a novel approach to explain neural network behavior by partitioning the network’s activity into meaningful semantic blocks. YASENN extracts distinct operations from the network’s activity, allowing us to identify the layers and input features responsible for each operation and their contribution to the prediction. We evaluate YASENN on several datasets, demonstrating its improved interpretability and comprehensiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results of YASENN provide a deeper understanding of the underlying decision making process and also help to debug and optimize the model.",
        " Our main contribution is a method of visual saliency detection which is based on a hierarchical representation of deep features. Our model is able to acquire features at multiple scales and thus represents the hierarchical structure of the image, identifying salient objects with higher accuracy. Our method detects salient objects and regions, even in complex scenes and objects of various sizes. Moreover, our saliency map is further improved by a fusion strategy which dynamically weights the contribution of each scale in the image based on the size of the local context. The experiments on a number of reference data sets show that the results of our method are among the best available. A number of the results are quite promising, and the method can be used in many other applications in the field of computer vision.",
        " There is no doubt that precise root segmentation is necessary for plant phenotyping and for a correct understanding of the architecture of the root system. However, the resolution of the MRI images, which are often limited, makes it difficult to obtain precise segmentation. In this article, we apply a 3D U-Net architecture to the task of segmenting root structures in magnetic resonance images, particularly in the super-resolution context. It is proposed that the integration of the 3D structure in the U-Net could overcome the limitations of lower resolution images and benefit from the added detail of super-resolution images. We present the 3D U-Net architecture, the training method, and some preliminary results demonstrating its effectiveness on a set of MRI images of roots. Future work will focus on the adaptation of the network architecture and the verification of the model on other plant species and imaging conditions. The results show a very good level of accuracy of the segmentation, and highlight the possibilities of using a 3D U-Net in combination with super-resolution methods for the phenotyping of roots using MRI.",
        " The activity of neural populations is a critical problem for the study of brain function. Point process models offer a powerful framework for analyzing spike trains, but require laborious construction of features, and the assumptions that spiking neural activity is generated by a very narrow and regular distribution. We present Deep Random Splines (DRS), a novel approach for estimating the intensity function of point processes from neural population data. DRS uses a deep neural network to map input features (e.g., the spiking activity of other cells) to the parameters of random B-splines. These splines are then used to construct the intensity function, providing a smooth and flexible representation of neural activity. DRS combines the flexibility of random splines with the automatic learning capabilities of a deep neural network, enabling the automatic learning of complex, non-linear relationships between neural activity and the intensity of point processes. DRS is a flexible and powerful tool for analyzing the complex interplay between the activity of populations of cells, and so will ultimately facilitate our understanding of neural activity and ultimately brain function. DRS is shown to be effective on both simulated and real neural population data, and outperforms the use of point processes and other deep learning methods in capturing the dependence structure and temporal dynamics of neural activity.",
        " This paper introduces a large-scale, graph-representation learning (GRL) dataset for evaluating the performance of graph-representation learning. The performance of GRL models often depends on the availability of large and diverse data. We present the structure and collection method of this dataset, and also show some of its key features, such as standardized format, readily available graph statistics, and clear license information. We also show some of the experiments that have been conducted on this dataset. The major features of this database are the rich and diverse graphs, such as social networks, citation networks, knowledge networks, and biological networks, carefully selected and standardized. Then, we present a few typical examples of popular GRL models on some selected data. We compare the performance of these models on this data. These experiments have been carried out on an important portion of the graphs in the database, and show how they can be used for the evaluation of these models. We expect that this large-scale, public GRL dataset will be a useful tool for the research community in graph-representation learning.",

Its application is confined to a set of psychological dimensions, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism and Openness.

        " TEMPORAL NETWORK EMBEDDINGS TO CAPTURE THE DIMENSIONS OF TEMPORAL NETWORKS — Temporal network embeddings aim at capturing the dynamic evolution of relationships between nodes in a network. Existing methods focus on the aggregation of time into a static representation, or on the modeling of temporal dependencies using recurrent neural networks. However, these methods often fail to consider the multi-facet nature of temporal interactions, whereby different properties of a relationship (e.g. the frequency, the recency, the intensity) affect the temporal dynamics of the network. Thus, we propose a novel temporal network embedding framework based on a mixture of Hawkes processes. We decompose the temporal network interactions into different facets, each of which is modeled using a Hawkes process, which captures the cyclic and mutually affecting temporal dynamics of the network. The parameters of each Hawkes process, which represent the influences and the background rate of the temporal dynamics, are incorporated into a low-dimensional representation. The proposed method is evaluated on several real-world temporal network datasets and shows superior performance in both node and link prediction tasks compared to state-of-the-art temporal network embedding methods. By learning a mixture of these different facets, we capture the full and diverse temporal dynamics present in real-world temporal networks.",
        " Optimistic exploration is guided by an optimistic exploration policy. This paper considers policy optimization and exploration in the setting of linear regression, by presenting a new strategy, called COPO, which combines optimistic exploration with a cautious policy update policy. The sample complexity of COPO is theoretically proved, under suitable assumptions, and it is shown to give a near-optimal regret. At the same time, COPO avoids the unstable, deteriorating performance of nonlinear systems that can result from the linear approximation of a nonlinear function by using a cautious policy update. In experiments on several standard problems, COPO is shown to be more effective than existing policy optimizer methods that approximate the function by a linear regression, especially in cases that demand a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation.",
        " By reasoning with their neighbors, Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) use information on their immediate neighbors to learn node embeddings. But this assumption, that nodes in a graph are more likely to share the same properties and the same labels, is not necessarily true, and can lead to poor performance when the assumption is not met or when spurious correlations exist between neighbors. Our solution uses a back-door method to estimate the effect of the node's properties on its own representation, thereby reducing the influence of the neighbors. In our experiments on synthetic and real data, the selective inhibition of the neighbors' influences leads to better node classification and higher resistance to attacks. Our results emphasize the importance of a causal view in graph learning, and provide a practical way to increase the trustworthiness and accuracy of GCNs.",
        " XII. A method of transforming MRI images into CT images is presented. The difficulty in such transformations is due to the absence of a paired dataset for training and the great differences between the images. A SUGAN-like network was trained with a convolutional network and the use of adversarial training to control the consistency of the local structure. The evaluation was carried out on a public chest dataset and showed superior performance to the existing unsupervised methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, an attention mechanism was introduced in the generator to enhance the relevance of anatomical regions and improve the quality of the resulting images. The method could also be applied to other medical images where a paired data set was not available or was difficult to obtain.",
        " Our method, which we call Spatial Pyramid based Graph Reasoning, makes use of a spatial pyramid pooling method to extract a set of multi-scale features, thereby capturing objects of different sizes and locations. We then use these features to construct a graph in which each node represents a region, and edges the relationships between regions. We show that our method performs well on a challenging data set, and is able to capture complex contextual dependencies necessary for accurate semantic segmentation. The graph is propagated across the network, enabling the neural network to learn context and to disambiguate regions that are difficult to identify. Our experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in challenging settings with many scales and highly overlapping regions.",
        " In this paper, we present a unifying view of the effect of the gradient in the training of linear neural networks. Despite their simplicity, these networks have complex and often surprising properties, particularly with respect to the implicit regularization induced by gradient descent. We show that seemingly disparate observations, such as the tendency for the solution to be minimum, of low rank, and to align with the principal components, are manifestations of a single underlying principle, which is that the gradient implicitly biases the solution toward structures of lower complexity and aligned with the principal components. We then use this unifying view to explain the generalization performance of these networks and to identify conditions under which the biases may be beneficial or detrimental. We formally articulate this principle using a novel framework that relates the gradient and the spectral properties of the data covariance matrix, which enables us to analyze the convergence of the network and the properties of the resulting solution for different initializations and learning rates. We provide a more complete picture of the effect of the gradient, which is a foundation for understanding implicit regularization in more complex models.",
        " The author is offering a domain adaptation method that does not need supervision. The problem of obtaining an invariant segmentation model from one kind of data to another is thus addressed. It is precisely by aligning the category-specific prototypes that the proposed method ensures better feature learning and, as a consequence, a better segmentation in the target domain. Moreover, it is strengthened by the integration of a domain adversarial training strategy, which seeks to minimize the feature differences between the two domains. The approach is evaluated on a demanding biomedical image segmentation task. The superiority of the proposed method over the other unsupervised methods is proven on a challenging medical image task.",
        " Our method is a “Dynamic Graph Representation Learning by Self-attention” (DGR-SAN) method. The dynamic graph reflects the temporal dependency of the relationship between the nodes, and the structure of the relationship is changing. To this end, we add temporal attention and structural attention. We learn the significance of the neighbor node dynamically with each iteration. DGR-SAN makes use of self-attention mechanisms to integrate the current and past graph states and thus learns dynamic node representations that reflect the evolving network structure and node properties. DGR-SAN can effectively capture the temporal dependencies and structural changes in the network, and the results of our experiments on the three kinds of data demonstrate this.",

In addition, a review of the performance metrics used to evaluate Dynamic Embeddings is given. A large number of open problems and suggestions for further research are presented.",
        " They are very much excited by the hypothesis that the poets are seeking to understand what they saw, as a means of helping them to make the statement to the audience, and also to learn the methods of the conversationists, with a view to a criticism of their manners and opinions, the function of the philosophers, and their peculiar modes of expressing themselves. It is clear, however, that the poets did not see this young man; but that they do not care to make this clear to themselves. Then we introduce a new method, called XXXX, which alleviates the language prior. XXXX explains the development of the method, by a simple analogy with an enlightened and refined physiognomy. In extensive experiments on a number of existing datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully alleviate the reliance on language priors, which leads to a significant improvement in performance, especially on difficult out-of-distribution questions.",
        " This work examines the application of artificial intelligence to the analysis and prediction of the stability of the spray flame. The pyrolysis method of sprinkling is a promising method for the synthesis of a new type of phosphor with the help of the spray flame, but this method has a large dependence on the stability of the flame. The stability of the flame is the most important factor in the pyrolysis method. The study demonstrates the ability of artificial intelligence to improve the understanding and control of the flame dynamics of sprinkling, thus allowing a more reliable and efficient production of high-quality nanomaterials. We develop and train machine learning models based on experimental data or computational fluid dynamics simulations, to identify the key factors influencing the stability of the flame. These models can predict the stability regions and potentially optimize the operating conditions to obtain more stable and efficient production of particles.",

The object of this research is to study the properties of the generalization ability of the CDRL models. In this paper we examine the effect of the different architectures, training methods, and environment variations on the generalization ability of the agents. We also propose and test various strategies for data augmentation and regularization that can improve the generalization performance. It is hoped that this work will be useful for the deployment of intelligent agents that can learn and adapt to diverse situations.",
        " How Clinicians Want From XML in the Clinic? - (Surveys, interviews, focus groups) - we have investigated the expectations of the clinicians with regard to the desired properties of explanations, such as clarity, relevance, trustworthiness, and actionability. XML, a technique which is becoming very useful in clinical medicine, should be used to improve the clinical decision-making, and it is therefore necessary to understand the requirements of the clinicians, to deal with them. The result of this research is important for XML system development, which not only aims to be precise, but also to meet the specific information needs and cognitive process of the clinician, thereby contributing to building trust and informing decision-making in the complex and challenging environment of clinical medicine. We also study the preferences of the clinicians for certain types of predictions, patient populations, and expertise.",
        " Existing methods tend to focus on one or the other level of the representation of the data, and neglect the interaction between these two levels of information. Our framework attempts to circumvent this limitation by explicitly modelling the bidirectional relations between the global context and local features. We take advantage of the fact that, in the context of deep learning, this framework is more capable of learning more accurate and more robust representations. For this purpose, we use contrastive learning to improve the quality of the learned representations. Our results demonstrate the importance of this dual view for learning representations from 3D data without supervision. Our experiments on various downstream tasks, such as 3D object classification and semantic segmentation, demonstrate the efficacy of our method, which is more accurate than the state-of-the-art for unsupervised methods.",
        " Before introducing a new batch normalization method with enhanced linear transformation (ELT), we first mention the underlying mechanism of the batch normalization: The method of normalizing the mini-batch inputs, with the corresponding normalization in the mini-batch, can often be limited by the learning scale and the shift that can be learned from the samples. Therefore, we introduce the “batch normalization with enhanced linear transformation” (ELT), which replaces the original normalization with a more flexible and meaningful linear transformation. When the input and output are represented by two different units, the two units can form a more complex relationship with each other, and thus have better performance. We have tested ELT on a variety of standard network architectures and various standard datasets, and we have a significant increase in accuracy and convergence speed. The results indicate that batch normalization with enhanced linear transformation has a strong potential for improving deep learning models.",
        " “DCNAS is a novel Densely Connected Neural Architecture Search for semantic image segmentation. Compared to existing NAS methods, which are restricted in the exploration of complex architecture spaces and the speed of optimizing for segmentation tasks, our DCNAS can simultaneously connect all layers to the previous ones, thus discovering more complex and effective features. I use the differentiable architecture search method, which can efficiently optimize the gradient in the densely connected framework. Experimental results on various standard image datasets show that the results of DCNAS are much better than those of existing NAS and hand-made architectures, proving the effectiveness of densely connected search space and optimized search strategy for discovering powerful architectures for semantic image segmentation. ”",
        " An admirable success has been obtained in this article, in which a new method of semi-supervised learning has been developed to identify the subjects of the pictures; it has been called the semi-supervised self-growing generative network, and is introduced by the authors for the classification of pictures. It has been found that the resulting semi-supervised self-growing generative network has the power of the adversarial net to model the structure of the network during the process of training and, when trained, to give a greater and more complex representation of the unlabeled and the labeled pictures. The discriminator of the SS-SGGAN has been designed to classify both the labelled and unlabelled images, thus ensuring consistency between the distributions of the real and the synthetic data. The self-growing process has been guided by a new criterion, which weighs the need for greater model capacity against the dangers of overfitting, particularly in the semi-supervised case. It has been tested successfully on several image recognition and image recognition data sets. The result obtained illustrates the possibilities of self-growing GANs for combining the power of unlabelled data with a more complex learning of the distribution of the images.",
        " Traditionally, the analysis of a single type of objects or actions is limited to a local level, e.g. object recognition or action recognition, but a real understanding of the content of a whole scene, and therefore a whole story, requires the integration of visual, auditory, and textual cues, so as to infer the complex relationships, goals, and so on, that exist within the scene. ## The Sense of a Large Number of Holistic Objects in a Video This paper examines the evolution of large-scale, object-rich, semantic, and temporal video understanding, focusing on the aforementioned main challenges: temporal modeling, multi-modal fusion, and large-scale data collection, and current research on self-checking, knowledge networks, and contextual reasoning to achieve a more complete and complex understanding of the content of a scene. The main applications of large-scale, object-rich, semantic, and temporal understanding in the fields of automatic scene summary, intelligent supervision, and personalized content recommendation are also introduced.",
        " This paper investigates the robustness of visual question answering (VQA) systems by evaluating them on a targeted set of “basic questions.” These questions are designed to be simple, to require minimal reasoning, and to focus on the most basic visual understanding skills of object recognition and feature extraction. We analyze the performance of several state-of-the-art models on a new set of basic questions, revealing weaknesses in their ability to answer even the simplest questions. This analysis highlights the need for better training strategies and model designs that can learn to do more than simply exploit biases in the data, and lead to more robust and reliable VQA systems.",
        " During the last few years, the learning of molecular graphs has come to be seen as a potent tool for modelling molecular properties. The focus of the learning has been on message passing between directly connected atoms (nodes), but this simple communication is not sufficient to represent the interdependencies between molecules, the complexity of their interactions and the role of the chemical bonds between atoms. On the contrary, by structuring nodes into hierarchically connected clusters based on structural and chemical similarities, HIMP not only allows message passing within the clusters but also between the clusters, which allows the network to learn the dependencies between distant parts of the molecules. This paper proposes a novel framework, called Hierarchical Inter-Message Passing (HIMP), which includes the passing of messages between the clusters in the graph. Experiments on several labelled molecular property prediction datasets show that HIMP can produce significant improvements on learning of molecular graphs compared to state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures. We demonstrate that HIMP enhances the power of graph neural networks, enabling them to capture more complex molecular properties.",
        " The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of extending morphological operations, originally used in the field of signal processing, to the domain of categorical distributions. We propose a new approach based on the idea of directly applying morphological operators such as dilation, dilatation, opening and closing, directly to the probability mass functions that represent categorical data, thereby allowing smoothing, simplification and feature extraction in a probabilistic framework. We present a theoretical analysis of the properties of these morphological operators on categorical distributions and we compare them with other methods. We determine the appropriate structuring elements for these operations and analyze the effects they have on the distributional shape and entropy. We also show that they are useful in various applications such as the reduction of noise in categorical data, robust estimation of mixtures, and the extraction of latent structure from categorical data. We propose a new method of analyzing and manipulating categorical data by powerful methods of mathematical morphology.",

In this paper, an improved K-Means clustering method is presented. K+Means takes advantage of... and...... and thus provides better performance and accuracy than K-Means in various experiments.

        " Instead of relying on the usual denoising methods applied post-editing, we introduce a noise model into the editing flow. Editing inevitably generates or enhances noise. The noise model allows us to predict the effect of specific editing operations, such as contrast adjustment, sharpening, or colour grading, on the noise properties of the result. Our method is shown to produce significantly better results in terms of noise, contrast, and clarity than post-editing denoising. We have tested the system using several exemplar images on a large scale, and demonstrated its efficacy. To our knowledge, no other method exists for preserving and restoring photographic collections in this way.",

This comparison has led us to understand the relationship between the learning and the pre-training data. This result is of practical importance for the researcher or practitioner of medical images.",

        " By means of the inherent hierarchical structure of the deep neural network, we able to selectively activate and combine the features relevant to the diseases and their respective vulnerable areas. The two problems are addressed together in this paper by means of the use of the dynamic routing of the deep neural network. It has been demonstrated on an available chest X-ray set that the model enables improved performance on both disease recognition and vulnerable area localization, outperforms the state-of-the-art, and provides a clinically relevant understanding. The dynamic routing has also enabled us to extract features of the regions of the images which have the most influence on the classification, and so has localized the vulnerable areas.",
        " This paper presents a new sparse adversarial attack that aims to generate sparse and yet powerful perturbations. Object detection models, an important tool for many applications, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, the current attacks introduce large and ineffective disturbances across the entire image, which causes them to be easily detected and, in turn, are inefficient. We show through our experiments on a large number of real data that our method is comparable or even better than the attack success rate of dense attacks. This is achieved by... [a certain technique, such as sparse regularization, or a pruning strategy, or a feature selection method, for example] which drastically reduces the attack footprint. These results indicate that object detection models are vulnerable to sparse attacks, and a new method to combat this vulnerability can be developed.",
        " This paper describes Pix2Shape, a novel method for unsupervised learning of 3D scene representations from 2D images. Unlike previous methods that often rely on explicit 3D supervision or predefined object categories, Pix2Shape utilises a view-based representation to infer the underlying 3D structure of scenes directly from unlabelled image collections. Our method learns to predict multiple views from a single input image, thereby decoupling the point of view from the shape of the scene. Our results on synthetic and real-world data show the effectiveness of Pix2Shape in reconstructing plausible 3D shapes and in producing synthetic views. By enforcing consistency across these predicted views through the use of a cyclic consistency loss and learned view-dependent transformations, we encourage the emergence of a coherent and interpretable 3D scene representation.",
        " Such recognition is of great importance in applications to which assistive systems or personal alarm clocks are applicable. This paper aims at providing a complementary approach to the recognition of egocentric actions, the aim of which is to comprehend a person's actions from his own point of view. The objective of the present paper is to combine the two modalities, that is to say, visual and acoustic, to form a system which may be able to grasp the nature of actions from the point of view of the subject. The system takes features from the two modalities (e.g. convolutional neural networks for the visual features and MFCC for the acoustic features), fuses them (e.g. late fusion, early fusion, attention mechanism), and classifies the activity. The results obtained, on the EPIC-Kitchens data set, demonstrate the efficacy of this combination of modalities and show that the recognition accuracy of the multi-modal system is improved significantly compared with that of the uni-modal. These results show the importance of combining the two modalities for a better understanding of the subject's actions.",

To summarize, this extended abstract aims to give a brief overview of the current state of the art and future directions for causal neural networks.",
        " It is with the object of detecting and localizing the place of the alteration in an HDR image, that the work of this paper is devoted. High-density photography has become the universal standard for the recording and reproduction of a wider range of luminosity, but, along with the enhanced realism, it also offers new possibilities for the diabolical fabrication and alteration of images. Our method is based on a principle of the extraction of the HDR image from its own special statistical properties.. The operation of the HDR tone-mapping filter, for example, or the intrinsically unstable fusion of several exposures, creates the network. This network, as we will show, is able to discriminate between the original and the manipulated images. We consider the different network architectures and different learning strategies to optimize the performance and robustness of the network.",

The innovation of our method is a light and differentiable constraint that allows us to efficiently estimate the probability of each pixel belonging to the rigid background, and to find the pose of the camera. By using the known consistency between the rigidity of each pixel, we obtain a significant performance on the unsupervised estimation of optical flow and the segmentation of moving objects, with a reduction of the occlusions caused by independently moving objects. This method can handle complex scenes, allowing for the benefits of a more complete scene understanding.",

        " TO THE POINT: A discussion of the reasons why a model gives a particular prediction is crucial to verifying it, checking it, and debugging it. There are many methods for explaining these reasons, but most are model-dependent or provide only one level of explanation. This paper introduces a new method for explaining model outcomes in a model-independent way. It applies to a wide range of black-box models. It provides explanations at various levels, enabling users to access the high-level summary of the most influential features or to view the detailed contribution of each feature. Our method makes it possible to explain the reasoning of a model at different levels and thus provides greater transparency and control over complex machine-learning systems.",
        " This paper proposes a new theoretical framework for the concept of affordances in reinforcement learning agents. The affordances are the possibilities of action that the environment offers to the agent. They provide a powerful perspective to understand how the agents perceive and interact with their surroundings. The affordances also can be exploited to improve the performance of the agent in complex and changing environments. They can be used to construct an underlying logic that the agent can use to anticipate the consequences of its actions and select the most effective ones to achieve its goals. We also show how these affordance-based representations can be used to aid transfer learning, exploration and hierarchical policy development. The theoretical analysis and first experiments show the benefits of this approach and how it could be a foundation for more intelligent and more adaptive agents.",
        " This paper introduces SkrGAN, a novel sketch-and-render generative adversarial network (GAN) for the synthesis of medical images. This model first generates an abstract \"sketch\" of the underlying anatomical structure, then a rendering mechanism translates the sketch into a real medical image. This enables a more controlled and interpretable synthesis, which can increase the quality and the diversity of the images generated. Separating the structural and visual information in the network reduces the complexity of the training process and makes it possible to create high-quality medical images with plausible anatomical details. Our experiments on [sample dataset, modality e.g., chest X-rays] show that SkrGAN is able to produce highly believable images and achieves competitive results compared to existing unconditional GANs on [metrics, e.g., frechet inception distance and structural similarity index (ssim)]. We also investigate the potential of the sketch-representation for [use here some example application, e.g. data augmentation, anomaly detection, education].",
        " To this work was added a supplementary note, written on a similar style, but on a different line. This paper proposes a new method of image compression and resizing, using a Generative Adversarial Neural Network. The paper states: “Our method combines the concepts of generative adversarial network and image compression. This network jointly optimizes the generator, the compression, and the discriminator, thus promoting the generator to produce images that are easily compressible, and the compression to preserve perceptual quality. A discriminator then rates the realism of both the generated images and the decompressed images. Our method outperforms or outperforms the traditional methods in terms of compression ratios, while maintaining the perceptual quality of images. It is a better way to store and transmit images.”",

        " In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation method for screen content images based on least absolute deviation (LAD) fitting. Unlike least-squares fitting, which is prone to problems such as outliers and noise, the LAD method is more robust to these problems. Screen content image segmentation is important for many tasks, such as OCR, screen mirroring, and UI automation, but is often difficult to deal with, due to complex layouts, large text sizes, and noise. Our method, which is based on the LAD fitting method, tries to minimize the deviation of the observed image intensities from the fitted LAD model. Experimental results on a wide range of screen content images demonstrate that the proposed method has good accuracy and noise resistance, and also achieves high robustness.",
        " It is impossible to state, as with certainty, what may be the consequences of such methods for the calculation of the future value of a time series, but one thing is clear, that they cannot, in the long run, give a satisfactory forecast. Now a new form of the method of forecasting a series of numbers is suggested, a new mode of calculation, by means of images, to supplement that which has been done by statistical methods. All that is needed is a graphical representation of the series of numbers, which can be studied in different ways, by means of different coding schemes, and this is exactly what we are doing. We prove that our system gives a more correct forecast than the existing systems, and that our images, obtained by various means, can be used to express and calculate more complex phenomena. This article opens new possibilities for using the large number of advances in the field of computer vision to enhance the forecasting of time series.",

RadarScenes bridges this gap by providing a large collection of point clouds gathered in a wide range of conditions, including different weather, lighting and traffic densities. By providing synchronized data from other sensors, such as LiDAR and stereo-cameras, the dataset can be used to develop multi-modal fusion approaches. We describe the data and its characteristics in detail and compare the performance of several state-of-the-art object-detection methods, highlighting the challenges and opportunities that the radar can offer for vehicle perception. This dataset can be used for training, validating and evaluating algorithms based on real-world data.",
        " Convolutions on the Riemannian manifolds are here introduced in a unified and coordinate-invariant manner. This is achieved by taking advantage of the intrinsic geometry of the manifolds to construct convolutional operations which are equivariant under isometries and gauge transformations. Our formulation is tested in a number of manifold learning experiments, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and robustness. We provide a theoretical analysis of the isometry and gauge equivariance properties of our proposed convolutional operations.",
        " There are several ways of writing the abstract of a paper called Reward-Conditioned Policies. We present a novel framework for training reward-conditional policies, and we demonstrate its efficacy in a complex environment, showing that it is a good basis for building more flexible and more robust agents. Our experiments show that, with appropriate design, reward-conditional policies can outperform conventional reinforcement learning approaches, especially in environments with sparse rewards and multiple objectives. — Second option (focus on learning and optimization): Reward-conditional policies provide a promising way to allow agents to adapt to dynamically changing environments by conditioning their behavior on the desired reward outcomes. This paper explores the application of reward-conditional policies to (Specific task, e.g., manipulation, navigation). We show that reward-conditional policies can learn efficiently to perform various tasks in the environment, demonstrating their flexibility and robustness. — Third option (more theoretical, focusing on advantages and limitations): We introduce reward-conditional policies, a framework for reinforcement learning where the policy is explicitly conditioned on a scalar reward signal, enabling an agent to learn a single policy that can learn to pursue different objectives. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach, including its potential for improving sample efficiency and generalization. Key considerations for using reward-conditional policies, and strategies for overcoming the limitations are also discussed.the best abstract:** * **Target Audience:** Who are you trying to reach with this paper? * **Main Contributions:** What are the most important things you want readers to take away? * **Specific Content:** Does your paper focus on a particular environment, algorithm, or theoretical analysis?

        " This paper proposes a new efficient method of detecting the arbitrary shapes of characters in a real-time manner by using the technique of multiple rays. The rays are drawn from a single point in the middle of the text region, and are thus called the ray-based method. In the method proposed here, a novel loss function is used which minimizes the prediction error by regulating the consistency of the rays, resulting in improved accuracy of detection, especially for characters of curved or complex shapes. The rays are generated and their lengths predicted to reach the boundary of the text. The average of the lengths of the rays forms the boundary of the text. We have verified this by experiments on various test data. We conclude that this method is very useful for real-time applications which require accurate detection of text in a real-time manner.",
        " And this paper seeks to answer this question. We propose a method of learning objectness from sonar images, by exploiting the particular acoustic properties of the sonar signals. Unlike previous methods which rely on visual features, our method is class-independent and relies on acoustic data only. Having developed the method, we show it to be successful in identifying objects in a wide variety of underwater situations, both in terms of the variability of the underwater environment and of the classes of object that are to be identified. The proposed method is demonstrated on a large dataset of sonar images, which shows that our method is as successful as existing methods, but has the advantage of being class-independent and oblivious to changes in visual appearance. Our method of objectness is then used to generate a set of candidate object proposals, which significantly reduces the search space for a later object classification or retrieval. Objectness opens new possibilities for the identification of objects in difficult underwater situations where visual information is either limited or not available.",
        " At times a reinforcement-learning agent meets with a very sparse reward field which impedes the learning process and exploration. A means of reducing this sparsity by introducing additional, less sparse rewards, can help guide the agent towards promising areas, but it is difficult to design a reward-shaping function that is effective, especially in complex environments. This paper presents a novel approach to reward-shaping that can operate with different forms of information. Its weights are dynamically calculated on the basis of their impact on learning. Our results show that combining different information sources for shaping can be useful and can improve exploration in complex tasks. We demonstrate this on two benchmark environments, where our approach outperforms both classical reward-shaping and a modern exploration method.",
        " This paper addresses the problem of reducing the ambiguous bias of machine-learning models on both tabular and textual data. We consider several strategies, including pre-processing of the training data, in-processing that involves in-sample constraints and post-processing that adjusts the outputs. Moreover, we investigate the applicability and limitations of each technique for tabular and textual data, highlighting the specific challenges associated with bias reduction in each of these two domains. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in reducing biases across various groups of people and fairness metrics, focusing on the trade-off between fairness and performance.",

We investigate methods for learning policies that guarantee safety. Our method uses (describe the key ideas, such as: robust estimation of the constraint function and a policy optimization that integrates safety margins). We present a new approach (give the exact nature of the approach, if known) to explore-exploit trade-offs in CMDPs, focusing on learning the constraint function and adapting the policy in consequence. Our method relies on (state the main ideas, such as: a robust estimation of the constraint function and a policy optimization that integrates safety margins). Our results demonstrate the potential of our method for learning safe policies in real-world settings where safety is paramount.",
        " When an ensemble of observations and the model of the system are imperfect, a prediction is often difficult. We propose a hybrid method of combining the features of the Ensemble Kalman Filter and the reservoir computing, which is the new method to predict spatio-temporal chaotic systems. The performance of this hybrid method was evaluated on a spatio-temporal chaotic system. The hybrid method showed superiority over the methods of EKF and RC alone in cases of noisy and sparse observations.",
        " The choice of model in MobiBand and Reinforcement Learning is a difficult problem that is in some respects analogous to the choice of features in Random Forests. It is hard because it is impossible to precisely determine the probabilities of each of the models, and because the learning method may have to give up a model or accept it without knowing whether it is good or bad. This paper investigates this problem, and proposes a new method which is based on the blending of regret-based methods and elimination. During both the blending and elimination phases, it is demonstrated that by carefully balancing the exploration and exploitation in both the blending and elimination phases, the method can achieve an improved regret bound. Specifically, we show that our method achieves improved regret bounds compared to previous methods, and that by using the correction to the exploration-exploitation trade-off during both the blending and the elimination phases, the method can achieve a better performance than previous methods. We present empirical results which verify the theoretical analysis, and show the success of the proposed method in both MobiBand and Reinforcement Learning.",
        " Object detection is heavily dependent on anchors, whose geometric properties are fixed and whose arrangement in the image often does not match the distribution of the object itself. In this paper, a novel method of matching anchors to objects is introduced, FreeAnchor, which is able to dynamically match the occurrence of anchors with the distribution of the object. FreeAnchor is evaluated on the COCO and CLEVR-E datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance, and it shows that FreeAnchor is able to learn a more robust and adaptive matching strategy for object detection. Instead of a fixed overlap threshold, FreeAnchor allows each anchor to be assigned to multiple ground truths according to the estimated probability of the object and the predicted confidence of the classifier. This enables the system to learn a more efficient matching strategy and thus to achieve improved precision and recall.",
        " Because of the uncertainty we can cope with more difficult cases such as occlusions, smoothness, and different lighting conditions, and can produce depth maps with higher accuracy and robustness. We present a new method for predicting the depth of a scene from several images by the use of deep learning methods. Having developed a model that predicts both depth and the degree of uncertainty, we then use the degree of uncertainty as a weighting factor for the fusion of depths. The evaluation on a few standard data sets shows that the new method is able to improve the depth maps produced by the methods described in the literature, particularly in the regions with high uncertainty.",
        " A study is presented in which a new approach to the classification of multivariate time series is proposed, based on the use of a morphological transform. Multivariate time series classification is a challenging task, which is applied to a wide variety of fields. The new approach, which is called the “Multivariate Shapelet Transform,” extracts high-quality shapelets from the time series, which are then used to transform the original time series into a feature space, which is more convenient for the classifier. This transformation captures both the temporal characteristics of the individual dimensions and the mutual dependencies, which are crucial for accurate classification of the time series. The experiment on the MTSC data set is carried out, and MST is compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that MST achieves high accuracy and interpretability by highlighting the critical sub-sequences of the time series.",
        " We present DeepHMap++, a novel method to accurately and robustly estimate the full six degrees of freedom (DOF) pose of an object in a single image. DeepHMap++ enhances DeepHMap through the combination of projection grouping and correspondence learning. We employ projection grouping to cluster the projections from multiple views of the image, and then use correspondence learning to obtain accurate correspondences between the image points and the 3D model points. These learned correspondences are used in a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver to refine the initial pose estimate.",
        " This paper introduces the spectral-graph neural network, a new neural network architecture based on spectral graph theory. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are becoming a powerful tool for learning graph-structured data. Most of the GNNs operate in the vertex-wise domain, sequentially accumulating and transforming the information from the neighboring nodes. We introduce a flexible spectral-graph neural network (GNN-SMP), which is different from the vertex-wise GNN. By using the graph Laplacian to transform the node's local information into the spectral information, we can effectively realize the graph spectral analysis and spatially smooth learning, thus achieving the capability of learning more complex graph relationships. In the experiment of various graph tasks, such as node classification, edge prediction, and graph classification, the GNN-SMP achieved comparable performance with that of the GNN, and the advantages of using the spectral information to obtain the graph features are further verified.",
        " Transfer learning based on previously trained models is now a cornerstone of modern machine learning. However, pre-trained models are often over-parameterized, leading to unnecessary computations and potential over-fitting in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we present TransTailor, a novel method of pruning pre-trained models, which is intended to facilitate better transfer learning with pre-trained models. Our approach relies on a pruning mechanism which takes into account both the importance of each parameter and the layer-wise sensitivity to fine-tuning, thus reducing model size and computation time without sacrificing performance. Experiments on several large datasets show that TransTailor is able to greatly reduce the size of the model and the computation time, without any significant loss in performance compared to using the full pre-trained model or other pruning methods. TransTailor thus paves the way for efficient and effective transfer learning in a variety of task settings.",
        " In this paper, we propose CrossATNet, a novel cross-attention framework for sketch-based image retrieval, which explicitly learns and aligns the representations across different modalities. As our task is to retrieve images by sketching a concept from a large set of images, existing methods have been found to have difficulties in bridging the gap between the abstract concept and the realistic image. CrossATNet employs a double-layered network to jointly extract the features of the sketch and images, where attention mechanisms are employed to select the regions of images that match the sketch features and vice versa to enable a more fine-grained correspondence estimation between them. Moreover, extensive experiments are conducted on several large-scale datasets to show the effectiveness of CrossATNet. Our results on all the datasets show that the combination of attention and deep learning can achieve higher performance than the previous methods.",
        " Findings: The conventional approaches to estimating cyclone intensity and determining the structure of the cyclone often rely on subjective judgments or limited data. The present paper presents a new method of tropical cyclone intensity estimation and structure analysis, based on the inherent radial symmetry of cyclones, which are converted to polar coordinates, and it applies a convolutional neural network to profile the tropical cyclone using the polar-coordinate representation. Using the Himawari-8 satellite image, we show the effectiveness of this method. We evaluated the accuracy of identifying the eyewall radius and the correlation of cyclone intensity by using the sensitivity and the specificity of the features. In the future, it is expected that the tropical cyclone intensity can be improved by using the data obtained by applying the proposed method.",
        " An analysis of the limitations of the application of these models to real-world sales data is presented. Sales forecasting is a major component of inventory management, resource allocation, and general business strategy.. We demonstrate that while these models are able to identify the underlying trend, they are often unable to capture the true uncertainty of the data, leading to overconfident forecasts and misguided decisions. We present a critical evaluation of common time-series forecasting models including ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Deep Learning, and compare their performance on sales datasets characterized by various degrees of seasonality, trend, and noise. This paper serves as a call to arms for the careful application of probabilistic time-series models to sales forecasting.",
        " This paper presents a novel method, which is based on GANs, to bridge the domain gap between two point clouds. GFA uses a generator to convert the point cloud of the source domain into a point cloud that is indistinguishable from the target domain. This allows the downstream task to be adapted. Furthermore, we have acyclicity to maintain the semantic consistency of the generated point cloud and prevent mode collapse. The results on standard datasets show that GFA is very effective in adapting the point cloud between different domains, and that its classification and segmentation accuracy are significantly improved compared to previous methods. GANs, as a new means of generating points for a specific task, have the potential to extract features that can be used to process 3D point clouds.",
        " HE has long been anxious to determine the complex relations between the brain’s inner connections and its observable activity. But hitherto, these phenomena have been viewed separately, and thus we have omitted the combined information. If such a large-scale neuroimaging data set is available, our method can be applied to it and can be shown to outperform existing methods in a number of ways, such as predicting behavioral scores from the neural network’s connections. Also, the coupling of the two kinds of information can reveal complex, subtle, underlying relationships between the brain’s activity and behavior, with the potential for improved diagnoses and treatments.",
        " Spatially infinite generative models offer a powerful framework for generating textures, landscapes, and other visual data without any explicit boundary constraints. But these models’ lack of explicit boundaries makes them a challenge to interpret. This paper addresses the problem of understanding the underlying mechanism and emergent properties of spatially infinite generative models. We discuss techniques for exploring the underlying behavior of such models, including latent space exploration, feature visualization, and perturbation analysis, to identify the key factors governing their dynamics. We also present methods for decomposing and modifying the spatial structure of the models to control their generative dynamics. We hope that by providing tools and techniques for interpreting these complex models, this paper will help bridge the gap between the models’ formidable generative power and our understanding and control of them.",
        " LINEAR REGRESSION is the foundation of statistical learning methods, but when the training data is scarce it has little success. By transferring data from a related but distinct field by transfer learning one can significantly improve the performance of a regression task. This paper uses a new measure of domain similarity to enable the selection of a source domain, but it is difficult to select a source domain and to find the best transfer strategy. Our framework overcomes these difficulties by identifying the most appropriate source domain and by adjusting the transfer strategy to the structure of the data and to the domain similarity. Evaluated on a range of standard datasets, the framework is found to be effective and outperforms linear regression and existing transfer learning methods, especially in the presence of sparse data in the target domain. We also employ a meta-learning approach to optimize the transfer weights from the source domain to minimize negative transfer and to optimize performance in the target domain.",
        " The simplest way to increase the speed of a convolutional neural network is to delete superfluous filters. This is achieved by filter pruning. Filter pruning techniques have been proposed in the literature, but these methods have had difficulty in removing truly superfluous filters, particularly when the architecture is deep and complex. Our method actively identifies similar filters during training by introducing a regularization term that takes into account the training itself, and by pruning one of the pair, we obtain a large reduction in the number of filters without any substantial reduction in accuracy. This is a practical and efficient method for adapting convolutional neural networks with a deep and complex architecture to the constraints of resource-limited devices. We have compared the performance of our method on the MNIST and Inception data sets, and on a series of complex architectures, obtaining good results for filter pruning and a reduction in the size of the network.",
        " This paper introduces DECOR-GAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for enhancing the visual realism of 3D shapes by adding high-frequency geometric details. Different from previous methods, which often have difficulty generating fine-grained details, or lack control over the generation process, DECOR-GAN is based on a conditional refinement approach. The generator is used to iteratively refine a coarse 3D shape with both the coarse shape itself and a style code. This enables the controlled generation of diverse and realistic details while maintaining the coarse shape's structure. A discriminator is used to evaluate the realism of the refined shape, which encourages the generator to produce more plausible geometric features. We perform a visual and quantitative evaluation of the proposed method, and demonstrate its effectiveness by generating high-quality shapes with complex details that outperform state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity and shape accuracy. And we also show the potential of conditional GANs for detailization tasks in 3D shape modeling.",
        " The reader will find the following: This paper presents Decision Forest, a new nonparametric method for modeling irrational choice that avoids the difficulties of the standard parametric methods, which impose restrictive assumptions on the underlying utility functions and distributions. Decision Forest uses ensemble learning, especially random forest ensembles, to predict choice probabilities directly from individual characteristics and decision attributes. We demonstrate the performance of Decision Forest using both simulated and real data, showing that it can accurately predict choice probabilities in situations in which the subjects show systematic deviations from rationality. Decision Forest captures heterogeneous preferences by dividing the decision space into localized regions, which can include biases, heuristics, and context-dependent effects that deviate from rationality.",

By this I mean that we, the committee, did not accept the false character of the demonstrations made by the teams of many disciples of the One and the Son, of whom the first reader will have heard... If you have an example, why don't you give it to us to see the three omens that were ascribed to you by your followers? Abstract: We use an explicit model to systematically investigate the impact of the statistical relationship between the training and test data on the performance of transfer learning strategies. Our model is able to impose an exact relationship between the data, thus allowing us to investigate the impact of statistical relationships on transfer learning performance. We provide an empirical framework for interpreting transfer learning performance from synthetic data, and discuss the impact of various aspects of the relationship on performance.",
        " The minimum description length constraint mechanism of this paper is based on the idea that, to obtain a compact representation, it is necessary to constrain the complex aspects of the learned latent space. This constraint is accomplished by penalizing the number of dimensions in the latent space of a given layer. Specifically, we introduce a minimum description length constraint on each layer that minimizes the description length of the layer's own activation for a given learned prior, thereby causing the network to select and amplify only the relevant features and to suppress those that are irrelevant. This constraint leads the network to highlight the relevant features and suppress the irrelevant ones, in a manner similar to an attention mechanism. Moreover, we examine the learned priors and find that they capture the underlying structure of the data and guide the attention mechanism. In experiments on the data set, we show that this attention mechanism outperforms the generalization performance of neural networks and other unsupervised attention methods.",
        " A heterogeneous graph is characterized by diverse node and edge classes. It poses new challenges to graph-based neural networks. The paper presents a novel method called Schema-Aware Deep Graph Convolutional Network (SADGCN) to learn the node representations in a heterogeneous graph. The method is composed of two stages. The first stage is a Schema-Aware Attention Layer that learns the attentions of the node types based on the graph topology, which can selectively gather information from the neighboring nodes with the same topology. Deep Graph Convolution Layer is then used to learn the node representations. The paper experiments with several existing heterogeneous graphs on the node classification and the node connection prediction tasks. Experimental results show that SADGCN achieves a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods.",
        " The following work examines the possibility of using Generative Adversarial Networks for the discovery of deviations in the series of different indicators, which is the subject of this paper. We present a novel method based on the ability of the GAN to infer the distribution of normal data, and introduces a new approach based on a certain number of weights. We conduct an empirical study on the multivariate multivariate time series of the test set, and show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the existing methods. The model is trained on a set of normal time series data, and the ability to detect deviations is realized by evaluating the deviation of the original series from the generated series of the generator. High deviations from the learned normality indicate the potential for an unusual event. The obtained results show the ability of GAN to detect complex multivariate time series.",

WE HAVE USE [specify the method used here, e.g. a clustering method, a deep learning method] to detect and separate these blurred components. Then these components are used as a guide to obtain a more accurate spatially varying blur kernel field. Using this field, the sharpened image is obtained by deconvolution.

        " This paper presents a novel unsupervised learning framework for obtaining depth maps from light fields which directly addresses the problem of occlusions. Our framework is based on a deep convolutional network, which is trained end-to-end without the use of ground truth depth maps. Furthermore, we make use of a photometric consistency loss which enforces consistency across views, and an epipolar consistency loss which enforces geometric consistency. In particular, we introduce a visibility estimation step which predicts the likelihood of each point being visible from each of the light field views. Depth inconsistencies are thus incurred only in the visible regions, and depth constraints are relaxed in occluded regions. Our method outperforms previous unsupervised methods in the presence of occlusions, and leads to the state-of-the-art in unsupervised light field depth estimation.",

Our results show that it is possible to realistically generate X-ray images, thereby enabling diagnostic models to cope with the lack of available data. We evaluate the quality of the generated images visually and by metrics, such as the Fréchet Inception Distance and the Inception Score. We also analyze the impact of adding DCGAN-generated images to the training data of a convolutional neural network, trained to detect the presence of pulmonary pathologies. \"",

        " This paper describes the use of word class representations to improve the performance of multiclass text classification. Multiclass text classification is a fundamental problem in natural language processing. Conventional approaches are based on bag-of-words or term-document features, which lack semantic understanding and are not well equipped to deal with polysemy and synonymy. We propose a novel architecture that combines word embeddings with class-related word representations, and we show that the performance is significantly improved compared to standard word embeddings and features. In particular, we show that by using word classes, such as parts of speech or named entity classes, we can learn more nuanced and contextually sensitive representations, which improve the classification performance over bag-of-words and traditional features. We evaluated our approach on several popular multiclass text classification benchmarks and found it to perform better than word-co-occurrence-based models and conventional feature engineering methods. The contribution of this work is to demonstrate the value of using language-based features for text classification.",
        " A special kind of active contours is known as the Chan-Vese method, which is a powerful level-set method, because, unlike the edge-based methods, the Chan-Vese method is based on a criterion that divides the image into two regions based on their mean intensities. The level-set method can detect objects with weak or incomplete boundaries, and is particularly useful in images with noise, textures, and inhomogeneous intensity distributions. It is also useful for the identification of objects with shape deformation, such as a spherical, convex, or concave boundary. This article briefly describes the Chan-Vese method, including its main components, advantages, and disadvantages, and describes the method of iteratively evolving the level set function to minimize the energy. It also discusses the application of the Chan-Vese method to image segmentation and its importance in the field of computer vision.",

This enables us to align the latent distributions of the source and target domains without needing to resort to explicit correspondences or labels in the target domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several test sets and show that it outperforms other domain conversion methods, particularly in the presence of strong domain transformations and a lack of information about the target domain.",
        " SVM has been used in time-series classification, but it is not easy to acquire large amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive and difficult to acquire.

Deep learning models suffer from over-parameterization, which leads to an increase in computation time and memory footprint. Structural sparsity, where whole clusters of weights are deleted, offers a promising way to reduce the number of parameters and thus improve the generalization performance. We present a specific formulation that combines a group-level regularization with the Adam and RMSprop optimizers. Empirical results on various datasets show that our adaptive optimizer achieves significant model reduction with a comparable or improved accuracy compared to standard methods. This work presents a practical and effective framework for training compact and efficient deep learning models. Moreover, we show that the resulting sparse models have improved robustness and generalization properties.",
        " The data-driven routing technique tries to make the best use of historical information about traffic patterns by representing the network as a graph. The nodes in this graph are the end devices, and the edges represent connections. The system is evaluated using simulations, which demonstrate that GDDR is able to outperform other routing methods in dynamic traffic scenarios, resulting in significant increases in both efficiency and resilience. The neural network uses past data to train itself to recognize optimum routes, learning the complex relationships between traffic and routing performance metrics. Unlike conventional routing methods, which rely on a static view of the network and make adjustments only in response to congestion, GDDR is a proactive approach, trying to anticipate the congestion and optimize the routes to minimize delay and increase throughput. The simulated results show that GNNs are a viable method for routing in complex network environments.",
        " Sales forecasts are necessary for the effective management of stock and the control of profitability in e-commerce. But the classical methods have difficulty in coping with the complex, non-linear and multiple-mode nature of e-commerce demand, which is strongly influenced by various factors such as seasons, promotions and the relationship between products. We introduce ARMDN, an associative and recurrent mixture density network, a new probabilistic e-retailing forecasting architecture based on deep learning. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal structure of demand in a deep fashion, while associative mechanisms can learn the information of related products and thus overcome the difficulty of forecasting items with little historical data or those affected by inter-product relationships. ARMDN uses the recurrent neural network to generate a probability distribution of future demand, rather than a single forecast, which can accommodate the uncertainty and the possibility of multiple modes. The experiments on real e-retailing data show that ARMDN significantly outperforms other forecasting methods in terms of both the accuracy of the forecast and the variability of the forecast.",
        " Localization in three dimensions, or the localization of a camera in a known environment, is a problem that concerns all kinds of machines, e.g. robots, augmented reality, navigation, etc. Localization in three dimensions is a problem that is posed by various learning models which have no explicit geometrical representation. However, they can be used in this context to learn a compact representation of the environment. We have studied such a neural network for the localization of the camera and have shown that it is able to learn directly from the input images the camera pose by encoding the three-dimensional spatial structure of the scene in its own internal network. We have demonstrated this on the largest known datasets. Our results point out the potential of learning-based implicit mappings for the accurate and fast localization of the camera in three dimensions. We also analyze the learned implicit representations to study the network’s knowledge of the three-dimensional scene.",

        " CLASSIFICATION: Incremental learning is the learning of classes, one after another, without the loss of the old classes. A major difficulty of this kind of learning is that when one class is learned, the performance on the previous classes is greatly impaired. This paper proposes a new method of increment learning based on the integration of deep models. The idea is to take advantage of the advantages of knowledge distillation and regularization, to integrate the knowledge of the previous model, and to learn new classes and the performance of the previous classes, and achieve the goal of learning new classes without losing the performance of the old classes. The experiments show that this deep model integration method is a feasible and effective solution to the difficulty of class increment learning. Compared with other methods, it has higher accuracy, less forgetting and higher learning efficiency.",
        " As there are two dominant approaches for explaining the decision-making processes of complex ML models, perturbation-based and gradient-based, their explanations often differ and their robustness to attacks differs. This paper explores the possibility of unifying these approaches and enhancing their robustness. Essentially, a novel approach that draws on both strengths is proposed, which, for example, may include gradient information in the perturbation strategy or regularize gradients with the expectation of perturbation effects. We show, through preliminary results, that it may produce more consistent explanations and a higher robustness to attacks, thus enabling more trustworthy and interpretable AI systems.",

Having resorted to the services of the authorities, he had called in the services of the firm, but they had not responded. This model is shown to produce more precise and less distracted driving policies compared to traditional visual features alone.",
        " This paper describes a new gaze estimation method based on the transform. Such methods depend on hand-crafted features that are vulnerable to the variability of head pose, lighting, and the individual appearance of the face. Our method directly inputs features of face landmarks or patches of images as sequences, thereby implicitly capturing the complexity of facial features and their surroundings, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on a public gaze estimation dataset. The performance of our method, which is based on the transform, is shown in comparison with previous gaze estimation methods. The success of our method is inferred from the complexities of the sequences describing the gaze pattern and their effectiveness in describing such complex patterns.",
        " In this paper, we present INTEL-TUT, a new image dataset that has been designed to test and develop methods for automatic colorization invariant to the type of camera. Recent color constancy algorithms rely heavily on the data set they were trained on, and the quality of the results they produce can be degraded when they are used on images taken by different cameras. We describe in detail the methods we used to collect the data, and the calibrations we used to ensure accurate color representation. INTEL-TUT is a multi-camera image set captured under a variety of illumination conditions, and it includes ground-truth illuminant color values obtained from spectral measurements. By providing a challenging and well-calibrated multi-camera image set, INTEL-TUT aims to stimulate the development of robust and camera-invariant color constancy methods. We present an evaluation of several recent popular color constancy methods, and discuss the effects of the various camera conditions on their performance.",
        " Former methods had great difficulty in distinguishing between the enumerated and the corresponding objects in the images, because of the complex relations between the enumeration and the localization. We present a new method, a regressive network, guided by the input data, which directly predicts the bounding box of the object, thus avoiding the problem of complex contexts. Context policy, by incorporating the context around the query, enables disambiguation of similar objects and complex relations. This policy is based on reinforcement learning, which rewards the selection of contexts that improve grounding accuracy. We tested on various public data sets, and found that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially in the case of complex relations.",
        " HID is a powerful technique for learning visual representations without human annotation. Its effectiveness is strongly dependent on the quality and the number of the negative examples, and we still lack a clear understanding of the effects of these. It is an investigation of the effects of different negative example generation strategies, e.g. random sampling, hard negative mining, and semantic-based techniques. We study how the different choices affect the task performance, the generalization capability, and the feature space structure of the learned representations. Ultimately, the goal is to deepen our understanding of the effects of negative examples in ID-SSL. With a better understanding, we can design more robust and effective self-supervised learning methods.",
        " MemN2N has shown excellent performance in answering knowledge-based questions, but its performance is reduced when the task involves reasoning over large knowledge bases. We therefore investigate strategies for scaling MemN2N to deal with a large knowledge base, focusing on the question of memory indexing and retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that MemN2N can successfully process and reason over a large set of facts, which in our experiments is [the set size, e.g. millions of facts] in a simple question-answering task, with the same or better performance as existing approaches. We discuss the limitations of our approach, and point to avenues for future research on scaling memory-augmented neural networks for more complex reasoning tasks.",
        " CHAPTER IV.—PHOTONIC SCENE GENERATION FROM RGB-D SCANS— This paper describes a novel self-supervised approach for generating photometrically correct views from RGB-D scans. It takes advantage of the wealth of readily available RGB-D data to learn a generative model that can produce realistic and photometrically consistent views of a scene. Using a combination of a comprehensive numerical and visual evaluation on three publicly available datasets, we show that our method performs competitively with the best supervised methods, and does not require labeled data. We also analyze the learned representations and show their potential for scene understanding and relighting."
