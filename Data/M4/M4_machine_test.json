        "Yes, people made paper airplanes before the invention of actual airplanes. The concept of making miniature models of flying objects out of paper dates back to ancient China, where they would fold paper into the shape of birds or other flying animals to entertain children or during ceremonies. However, it was not until the 19th century that modern paper airplanes became popular. \n\nIn the 1860s, George Cayley, an English engineer, made the first successful model of a glider that was made of paper. One of Cayley's assistants, William Baden Powell, invented the first paper airplane that looked like a real plane in 1901. In 1909, Alberto Santos-Dumont, a Brazilian pilot, designed and built a paper plane that flew for 22 yards, which is considered the first modern paper airplane. \n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the use of paper airplanes became more widespread as commercial paper became cheaper and more readily available. During World War II, paper planes were used as a way for soldiers to pass the time and entertain themselves during periods of downtime. \n\nThe popularity of paper airplanes continues today as a hobby and educational tool. The art of paper airplane-making has evolved to create intricate designs and models that can fly for longer distances and in various patterns. Paper airplanes have also been used in scientific experiments and as a teaching tool for physics and aerodynamics. \n\nIn conclusion, people have been making paper airplanes for centuries, and their popularity has only increased as the art form has evolved and developed into a practical and educational tool for both recreation and learning.",
        "The Navy Special Action Regiment (NSAR) is an elite unit of the Zimbabwean Army and of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. Formed in 1980, the unit is thought to have been modelled on South Africa's special forces unit, the Commando Force. The unit is nicknamed \"The Iron Guard\" and is composed of mainly former special forces soldiers from Zimbabwe and South Africa. NSAR operatives are trained in unconventional warfare, counter insurgency, counterterrorism, airborne operations and naval warfare. In January 2017, the unit was deployed to South Sudan in response to escalating tensions between President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar, who had earlier in the year declared a ceasefire. During the deployment, several skirmishes with various insurgent forces followed, resulting in the loss of several members of the unit. Since the formation of the NSAR, the unit has been involved in numerous military coups and domestic operations in Zimbabwe. Between 1981 and 1989, the unit was largely responsible for human rights violations against white commercial farmers in Zimbabwe, whom the then-Zimbabwean government viewed as hostile because of their support for the white-minority regime in South Africa. The unit carried out operations under the leadership of Joshua Nkomo, then President of Zimbabwe, which included the torture and killing of at least 5,000 people, the arbitrary seizure of land and property, and the destruction of over 1,000 black-owned businesses. Between 1989 and 2000, the unit was commanded by Joshua Nkomo's son, Solomon, who is also a former President of Zimbabwe. During this time the unit was tasked with suppressing dissent in the National Defense Forces (NDF), a military force which served as a proxy for the oppressive government. The unit's activities in this regard are thought to have resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 members of the NDF, as well as numerous detentions and disappearances. Since 2000, the NSAR has been commanded by current President of Zimbabwe, Emmerson Mnangagwa.",

        "This paper is by [GAN authors], and submitted to [IJCAI]. This paper describes a new training method for sequence-to-sequence models, wherein the output sequence is designed to encode the semantic meaning of the input sequence. This method has the advantage that the network learns semantic representations of the input; these representations can be used to discover links between input pieces, and can also be used for textual entailment, search, etc. The method also has the disadvantage that the representations are tied to the specific task of sequence-to-sequence modeling, and cannot be used for other tasks. Overall, this is an interesting technique that shows how to use the output sequence to encode the semantic meaning of the input sequence; the drawback is that this technique is only applicable to this specific task. Overall, this is a **Accept** with some modifications. This paper describes a new training method for sequence-to-sequence models, wherein the output sequence is designed to encode the semantic meaning of the input sequence. This method has the advantage that the network learns semantic representations of the input; these representations can be used to discover links between input pieces, and can also be used for textual entailment, search, etc. The method also has the disadvantage that the representations are tied to the specific task of sequence-to-sequence modeling, and cannot be used for other tasks. The paper is divided into two main parts. First, it describes the encoding method, wherein the target text is designed to encode the semantic meaning of the input text. Second, it describes the model architecture and training procedure. The drawback is that this technique is only applicable to this specific task. **Overall, the idea is interesting but the application is too restrictive** **First, the idea is interesting but the application is too restrictive. The method is only applicable to the specific task of sequence-to-sequence modeling. Secondly, the semantic meaning of input sequence is restricted to one specific type, namely, equation, so that the model can learn the semantic representation of the input sequence by relating each word in the sequence to its corresponding mathematical operation. For example, the semantic representation of input sequence \"2*x + y = 5\" would be \"add\", \"2\", \"x\", \"+\", \"y\", \"=\", \"5\". In fact, this restricted semantic meaning is not very general, since it fails to capture the general semantic meaning of the input, such as the meaning of sentence. For example, the input sequence \"Apple is a popular fruit\" contains the general semantic meaning that Apple is a kind of fruit, and this meaning is beyond \"mathematical operation\". Similarly, the input sequence \"Hands off my watch!\" contains the general semantic meaning that Hands is something one person holds, and this meaning is beyond \"mathematical operation\". In summary, the restricted semantic meaning adopted by the first part of this paper is too restrictive, and it is not very general.** **Secondly, the idea of using the output sequence to encode the semantic meaning of the input sequence is innovative. The method can be used to discover links between input pieces and for other tasks, such as textual entailment and search. In the second part of the paper, the method is applied to the specific task of sequence-to-sequence modeling. Therefore, the idea is very innovative.** **Thirdly, this paper first defines the semantic meaning of the input sequence as a sequence of symbols, such as equation and text. Next, the paper proposes a new method for sequence-to-sequence model training. The method uses the semantic meaning of the input sequence as the target text to guide the model to generate the output sequence, by conditioning the output of each timestep on all the past timesteps and the input. The first advantage of this method is that the model can learn semantic representations of the input. In the Results section, the method is applied to the task of text generation. The second advantage is that the method can be applied to other tasks. In the Experiments section, the method is applied to the task of text classification. The results show that the model trained by this method can learn semantic representations of the sentence semantic meaning, and the representations can be used for classification. Therefore, this method has a broader application. The above-mentioned advantages make this article a good research topic for this journal.**",

        "In this work, we investigate the origin of which-way information and its connection with the Born rule, which is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. We propose a new methodology to study the relationship between these two concepts by introducing a generalization of the Born rule, which considers the role of which-way information in quantum measurements. Our approach is based on a set of experiments with two-path interferometers, where the presence of which-way information is controlled. We use a statistical analysis to compare the data obtained in these experiments with different theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that the Born rule is tightly related to the presence of which-way information in quantum measurements, and that the generalization of the Born rule provides a consistent description of the experimental results. \n\nThe motivation for this work comes from the need to understand the nature of quantum mechanics, which still presents several conceptual challenges. The origin of which-way information and its relationship with the Born rule are key aspects of this theory, and their study can shed new light onto its fundamental properties. Our results highlight the importance of considering the role of which-way information in quantum measurements, and can have important implications for the development of quantum technologies.",

        "\n\nWe propose signatures of weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of supersymmetric (SUSY) dark matter (DM) in the data from large-scale experiments at the LHC and in the spectra of cosmic rays (CRs). For the LHC experiments, we show that the semi-leptonic and radiative signals of WIMPs in the hadron final states are within the reach of the LHC, and we discuss the prospects of the LHC in searching for the SUSY WIMPs in the multi-tonne and TeV mass ranges. We also show that the expected rate of WIMP-nucleon collisions is large enough to produce the chorus of low-energy neutrinos observed by the IceCube experiment, provided that the WIMP mass is no heavier than a few TeV. As for the CRs, we show that the spectral distribution of CRs is consistent with the picture that the supergravity (SG) scale is close to the CR energy scale, provided that the mass of the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is not heavier than a few TeV. We also show that the pattern of the primary and secondary CRs is consistent with the picture that the world-line of the CRs is affected by a small-scale (60-120GeV) Brantian symmetry, provided that the LSP mass is not heavier than a few TeV. Our results suggest that a lightweight SUSY scenario is preferred over a heavy SUSY scenario for the DM.",

        "\n\nWe study the statistical properties of the velocity field in compressible MHD turbulence. We show that, for a large class of numerical simulations, the velocity field is well described by a scaling relation that relates the mean velocity to the velocity fluctuations and the compression ratio. Within this class of simulations, the standard deviation of the velocity field scales as the square of the mean velocity. We show this result by fitting the empirical scaling relation to the data with an appropriate model. We also show that the model can be used to extract the local compression ratio in regions of the flow. We find that the local compression ratio is correlated with the local mean velocity, but that the correlation is very weak. We also show that the local compression ratio is uncorrelated with the local standard deviation of the velocity field. We discuss these results in the framework of the Gurruwiwi-Ohno model, and show that the Gurruwiwi-Ohno model can be used to quantitatively reproduce our results.",

        "After the Civil War, Southern politicians did attempt to re-institute slavery. It was challenging, however, due to the reality that the nation had changed irrevocably. On the surface, the Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery in 1865 while the Fourteenth Amendment bolstered the rights of ex-slaves and African Americans. The Fifteenth Amendment, a few years later, gave African American males the right to vote, which undercut the long-held power that the Southern whites held over their ex-slaves.\n\nThese Constitutional Amendments were enforced with other measures as well. The Union army was present throughout the Southern states, keeping an eye on politicians who were trying to control their former slaves. The Freedmen’s Bureau was an agency set up to help former slaves transition from the plantation to a free life and provided them with education, legal assistance, and property ownership, if they were able to acquire it.\n\nNonetheless, Southern politicians did attempt to re-institute slavery in various ways. The Black Codes passed in 1865 were intentionally discriminatory, placing restrictions on where African Americans could live, work, and travel. A more calculated and formal move that was taken was the implementation of the Poll Tax, which essentially prevented African Americans from voting.\n\nHowever, it’s important to remember that any serious attempts to essentially create a new form of slavery were met with staunch opposition from the federal government. Congress and President Ulysses S. Grant used the power of the federal government to dissolve efforts to undermine the newly acquired freedoms of African Americans. Despite the multiple attempts to weaken the rights of African Americans, the Union prevailed and slavery was forever abolished.",
        "Answering this question gets pretty complicated! Superman's cape has been a long-standing part of his superhero getup ever since he was first seen in comics in 1938. Questions about how Superman's iconic cape behaves (especially in different contexts) has been a topic of discussion for decades. \n\nWhen Superman isn't flying, his cape hangs limply behind him, even when there is no breeze, suggesting that rudimentary aerodynamic principles apply. But as soon as he takes off, his cape is almost always shown floating behind him in a dramatic fashion, with no direct contact between the cape and Superman's body. However, in space, there is nothing to disrupt the uniformity and equality of air pressure, the winds, or the effects of gravity. \n\nSo how could Superman's cape actually behave if he was flying in space? To understand this, we need to take a deeper look into the science behind it. Due to the natures of creative license and artistic license, his cape has come to represent an item that is resistant to anything, including the vacuum of space.\n\nWithout air pressure or resistance, the cape would just hang motionless, floating behind Superman as he flies, and in all probability, the cape would be shaped by the forces of gravity. This leads to the conclusion that Superman’s cape in space would be shaped in a much different manner than it is on Earth. We can say that, due to this lack of air pressure, the cape would manifest a floundering, downward-curved shape in space, similar to the atmosphereless Earth in Stanley Kubrick’s film “2001: A Space Odyssey”.\n\nThe reality is that Superman’s cape may behave more like flapping fabric than a static piece of cloth in space; the reason being is because the vacuum of space produces no air resistance for the cloth to move against, which means the shape of the cape may not necessarily remain consistent from moment to moment. This type of behavior would also depend on the cloth used to make the cape and the position of Superman’s body, both of which can influence the cape’s aesthetic look. \n\nUltimately, Superman’s cape has become an iconic superhero symbol and its motion in space would be highly dependent on environmental and personal factors. Nevertheless, I think it’s safe to say that Superman’s cape behaves differently in space than it does on Earth,",
        "\n\nThe paper presents a novel procedure for building an evaluation dataset to validate compositional distributional semantics models for languages other than English, focusing specifically on the Polish language. The main strengths of the paper are that it provides a systematic approach for building such a dataset and that the dataset is extensively annotated for semantic relatedness and entailment. This dataset is a valuable resource for testing the effectiveness of compositional distributional semantics models on the Polish language.\n\nOne of the weaknesses of the paper is that it primarily focuses on the construction procedure of the dataset, with less attention paid to the evaluation of the models using this dataset. Additionally, it would be beneficial to compare the proposed dataset with existing evaluation datasets for Polish language models.\n\nAnother potential weakness is the relatively small size of the dataset. Considering that the compositional distributional semantics models require large data sets to train on, the dataset's small size could limit the effectiveness of the model evaluation. \n\nOverall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing by presenting a systematic approach to creating evaluation datasets for compositional distributional semantics models on languages other than English.",
        " Magyar Posse (also known as Posse Magyar) is an organization originating in Hungary, whose origin is rooted in the Magyar ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity of its members. The organization was initially founded in 1998 as an informal, private grassroots movement in response to the displacement and economic uncertainties posed by the transition from Communism to a market economy in Hungary. Its goal was to promote solidarity and protect the cultural heritage of the nation’s Magyar minority. In 2020, the organization became more officially organized, and a formal affiliate of the European Posse Federation was created to represent Magyar Posse on the international stage. Magyar Posse is open to any Hungarian national over the age of 18 or born to two Magyar parents, as well as associates of the organization who may not meet these criteria but wish to support its mission. The organization is currently headed by an executive council composed of representatives from across Hungary and a rotating president, who is elected every two years. The organization is funded entirely through donations and sponsorships, and is committed to the principles of non-violence and non-discrimination. As its mission statement suggests, the organization is mainly focused on preserving and promoting the Magyar identity, heritage and language. In particular, it has hosted public events and activities, created educational materials and scholarships, encouraged cultural exchange, and provided legal support to Magyar-speakers. It has also catalyzed the cooperative growth of small businesses within the Magyar community, and has disseminated cultural resources that raise awareness about the role of the Magyar people in Hungarian history. In recent years, Magyar Posse has also become increasingly involved in other social issues. It has offered resources for the betterment of individuals' lives such as career counseling and mentorship, as well as partnered with organizations and other civil society networks in Hungary to provide advocacy and support on issues ranging from LGBTQ+ rights to policies relating to the environment. Through its efforts, the organization has become a significant contributor to the growth and stability of the Hungarian nation.",

In addition to messaging services like chatting, voice calls can be made via this method too.    Real-Time Text has been used since then in many other applications including instant messaging software, online games, VoIP telephony systems, video conferencing tools, web browsers, email clients, social networking sites, remote control programs, digital cameras, GPS navigation units, medical equipment, industrial automation controllers, home appliances, military command centers, emergency response teams, public safety organizations, government agencies, financial institutions, retail stores, educational institutes, news media outlets, broadcasting stations, entertainment venues, sports stadiums, transportation vehicles, traffic management systems, weather forecasting models, stock market trading platforms, electronic voting machines, security surveillance systems, smart homes, wearable computing gadgets, virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, connected cars, drones, robots, self-driving automobiles, IoT devices, M2M networks, Smart Grids, SCADA systems, Industrial Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 technologies, 5G cellular communications infrastructure, cloud-based storage solutions, Big Data analytics frameworks, artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning techniques, deep neural networks, natural language processing engines, speech recognition modules, conversational agents, sentiment analysis bots, search engine crawlers, spam filters, malware scanners, cyber-security defense mechanisms, biometric authentication methods, cryptographic key exchange protocols, blockchain transaction records, distributed ledger databases, decentralized autonomous organization designs, peer-to-peer file sharing communities, streaming content delivery networks, live event broadcasts, interactive television channels, radio shows, podcasts, audiobooks, music videos, movies, TV commercials, advertising campaigns, promotional materials, signage displays, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, vending machines, self-service checkouts, automated teller machines, cash registers, ATMs, POS terminals, payment gateways, credit card readers, bar code scanners, RFID tags, NFC chips, QR codes, barcode labels, Radio-frequency identification (RFID), Near Field Communication (NFC).",
        "Ice cubes crack when liquid is poured over them because of something called thermal shock. When you pour liquid that is a different temperature than the ice, there is a huge difference in temperature suddenly. This difference in temperature makes the ice expand or change shape quickly, which makes it crack. This can happen to other things too, if they are put in very hot or very cold water.\n\nThermal shock is a sudden large change in the temperature of something. It's kind of like when you put something cold in the freezer and it gets too cold too fast and it breaks. Ice cubes are super sensitive to thermal shock because they're not that strong and they don't have a whole lot of time to adjust.\n\nOur bodies also have a thermal shock when we're in water that's too cold or too hot. Too much thermal shock can even hurt us! That's why we have to take showers and baths with water that isn't too hot or too cold.\n\nSo the bottom line is that ice cubes crack when liquid is poured over them because there is a big difference in temperature between them and the liquid, and the ice doesn't have enough time to adjust.",

        "Yes, this is historically accurate. During World War II, the U.S. Army created a system to determine which soldiers would be eligible to return home based on a point system. This system was known as the Army Service Forces Point System.\n\nSoldiers were awarded points based on a variety of factors, including time served in combat, rank, and awards received. Combat duty was given the highest point values, with one point awarded for each month of overseas service and one additional point for each month of combat duty.\n\nThe system was put in place to ensure that soldiers who had served the longest and had the most combat experience were the first to return home. This helped to prevent soldiers who had not seen combat from returning home before those who had fought on the front lines and experienced the most traumatic aspects of war.\n\nOnce a soldier had reached 85 points, they were eligible to return home and were placed on a list for repatriation. However, this did not guarantee an immediate return home. Due to logistical difficulties and the need for troops in certain areas, some soldiers with 85 points had to wait several months before they were actually able to return home.\n\nOverall, the Army Service Forces Point System was an important tool for ensuring that soldiers were fairly and equitably selected for repatriation based on their service and sacrifice.",

We also show how to construct such an optimal measurement for distinguishing between the given pair of states. This result is in contrast to the classical case where it has been shown that there exist pairs of nonorthogonal pure states which cannot be distinguished with certainty even when all possible measurements are allowed. The proof relies heavily on the fact that every state vector can be written as a convex combination of product vectors and uses ideas similar to those used in proving the Hahn-Banach theorem. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nThe problem of distinguishability of quantum states was first studied by Helstrom [1] . He showed that if one allows arbitrary (i.e., not necessarily positive) operator valued measures then any two orthogonal states can always be distinguished perfectly [2] , but this does not hold true for non-orthogonal states [3] .\nIn [4] we have proved that any two quantum states $|\\psi \\rangle$ and $|\\phi \\rangle$ can be distinguished with certainty by allowing only separable operations, namely tensor products of local measurements performed separately on each subsystem. In other words, the following statement holds true: \nFor any two quantum states $ | \\psi \\rangle $ and $ | \\phi \\rangle $ there exists a set of operators $ M_i^{(1)} $ acting on system 1 and another set of operators $ M_j^{(2)} $ acting on syste m 2 so that:",
        " The Creamy Layer (also referred to as the Creamy Class) is a phrase used in the Indian context to classify the higher echelons of socio-economic stratification. The term has its origin in the Creamy Layer principle of affirmative action, a tool adopted by the Indian Government to promote socio-economic equality within the public sector. The concept of the Creamy Layer first emerged in the early 1970s when the Indian government began implementing a series of reservations and support mechanisms aimed at improving the socio-economic plight of its marginalised castes and ethnic communities. These programmes were designed to help marginalised communities in the job market, in education, and other areas of public life. In order to build a system of equality, it became necessary to exclude the cream of these communities from the system of reservations, so as to ensure that only the most disadvantaged were served by the programmes. The Indian government identified the Creamy Layer as those members of marginalised communities who had achieved a certain level of educational and economic development, beyond what could reasonably be expected from their communities. This has been the basis for the government’s policy of excluding the Creamy Layer from quotas and benefits extended to the marginalised communities. The revised version of the National Anti-Exploitation Act of 2000 defines the term ‘Creamy Layer’ as “persons in or from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other backward Classes of citizens who satisfy either of the two conditions as certified by a competent authority: (a) having an annual family income of four lakh rupees; or (b) being a holder of a constitutional office or post or of any other type of post under the State.” The Creamy Layer Principle is an important element of India’s affirmative action policies, and has the potential to boost social mobility within the country. However, not all people are in favour of this policy, as some argue that it is an artificial and arbitrary classification of the population, and does not serve to address existing deep-seated socio-economic inequalities and injustices. The issue of the Creamy Layer and other similar measures has been discussed in the Supreme Court of India several times, most notably in the landmark Indra Sawhney Case in 1992. In this case, the Supreme Court held that the exclusion of the Creamy Layer from the scope of benefits and reservations is permissible, provided that the classification is reasonable and correlates to the objective it seeks to achieve. In recent times, the Indian government has taken steps to modify the Creamy Layer limits for different castes and communities. In 2019, the government raised the creamy layer limit to Rs 8 lakhs for Other Backward Classes and Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes, as well as barring income tax payees and those in high-paying public and private sector jobs, apart from a few other criteria, from applying for the quotas and benefits extended by the state. The debate over the Creamy Layer Principle is a major one in India, with both supporters and opponents viewing it from different perspectives and arguing for or against its implementation. Regardless, it is undeniable that this concept has been instrumental in the implementation of equality-driven policies in the country, and is likely to remain one of the most vital tools for affirmative action in the coming years.",

        "\nThis research investigates the high-speed collapse of two perfect fluids distributed cylindrically. For this purpose we employ an approximation scheme to explore the conditions of very large collapsing speeds of the two fluids. We investigate two scenarios, i.e. when the ratios of the pressures to the densities of the two fluids are bounded or vanish. It is found that if the pressures $p_1, p_2$ are non-zero, the high-speed approximation scheme breaks down once these ratios $c_s, d_s$ reach some positive constants. This breakdown of the high-speed approximation at a particular time in the collapse process indicates an uncertainty about the evolution of the system at and after this juncture. For the bounded case, there does not appear to be any possibility of a naked singularity arising from the two perfect fluids. On the other hand, in the vanishing case if a linear equation of state is used, the collapse is not held back by the pressures and therefore a naked singularity can form. This paper further broadens the results that have already been established by Nakao and Morisawa [1] for perfect fluid systems.",
        " Fahrenheit (known as Indigo Prophecy in North America) is a 1995 interactive drama video game developed by French company Quantic Dream and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released for the PlayStation in December 1995, and was also ported to Microsoft Windows in 1996 and the PlayStation Portable in 2009. The game is set in New York City in the not-too-distant future. The story follows a young man named Nicolas \"Nico\" Bell, who is struggling with amnesia and trying to uncover the truth about the murder of a female friend. The game uses a third-person perspective, with the player controlling Nico throughout the game. The game was originally titled Digital Outlaws, and was intended to be a traditional point-and-click adventure game, but the developers felt that the game's story and characters were not working. The game's development was re-focused, and the game's control scheme and interface were redesigned to be more like a traditional third-person video game. The game received mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics praising the game's originality, and others criticizing it for being too short and shallow. The game's interface and control scheme were also criticized for being awkward and confusing. Despite this, the game's story and characters were generally well-received, and the game's ending was widely praised for its ambiguity and open-endedness. In 2009, the game was ported to the PlayStation Portable, and was released as Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered. The remastering included new voice acting, new cutscenes, and new puzzles. The game's interface and control scheme were also redesigned for the PSP, and the game was made to be more open-ended and nonlinear. The game's story was also expanded, and a new ending was added. The game was also released for the PlayStation Store as Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy. Fahrenheit has since become a cult classic, and is widely considered to be one of the first examples of an interactive drama video game. The game's story and characters have also become popular topics of discussion and analysis among video game journalists and players.",
        " La Roche-en-Ardenne Castle is a medieval castle located in the town of La Roche-en-Ardenne, in the Province of Luxembourg, Belgium. The castle is one of the most renowned and beautiful castles in the country, characterized by its typically medieval towers and walls. The exact date on which La Roche-en-Ardenne Castle was first built is unknown, though some sources estimate it to the 9th century, during Carolingian Empire rule. At first, it served as an initiative of local counts who depended on the town’s strategic position near the rivers Ourthe and Lomme. In the 11th century, the castle was seized by the count of Luxembourg and later, it passed on to the earls of Bouillon. In the 15th century, the castle was severely damaged during the Burgundian Wars, and during the 16th century, it was rebuilt. However, it was once again destroyed in 1677, when Louis XIV of France sent an army to take over the castle. It was then reconstructed yet again, this time in a more modern appearance, with a tower and two massive bastions. Another restoration was made in the 20th century. Today, the castle remains a beautiful attraction and is open for tours year round. Visitors can explore the castle and visit the old armory and chapel, built in the 13th century. Additional facilities such as a hotel, restaurant and shop are also available for visitors. The castle also hosts a number of cultural events throughout the year, including music festivals, plays, and other social gatherings. La Roche-en-Ardenne Castle is a beloved tourist spot, and is widely admired for its grandeur and history. It remains a reminder of the turbulent past of Belgium, and a testament to its perseverance and strength.",

These tips can help you deal with unruly children.\n\nDetermine the reason for the unruliness.\nUnruliness can be a result of a child's inability to express himself or herself. Instead of crying, shouting, or acting out, encourage your child to use words to express emotions.\nTo help your child express feelings, provide a safe environment for expression. Let your child know it's okay to feel angry, but it's not okay to hit.\nOffer alternative ways for your child to express emotions. Ideas include:\nstomping feet\nholding hands over the mouth\nchewing on a favorite toy or blanket\nYour child might have difficulty expressing emotions because he or she is frustrated. Children with limited abilities, such as those with autism, may be especially prone to acting out.\n\nDetermine if the child is misbehaving or just being a child.\nSometimes a child's unruliness can be attributed to normal, childlike behavior. This includes:\n\nTalking back\nNot listening\nWaking up in the middle of the night\nBiting\nPlaying too rough\nHaving tantrums\nChildlike behavior is usually unacceptable when it comes at the wrong time. For example, you might not want your child to talk back to a teacher, but you might not mind when your child talks back to you in private.\nLet your child know what's acceptable and what's not acceptable. Children might not understand when unruliness is okay and when it's not.\n\nDetermine if your child is being influenced by others.\nChildren are influenced by their peers, parents, and television. If you find that your child is unruly when he or she is around a certain child or when watching a certain show, try to limit your child's contact with that influence.\nIf the unruly behavior is caused by a child's home environment, you may be able to change the environment to make it more positive. This might include:\n\nMoving furniture around\nGetting a new pet\nIntroducing a new family member\n\nDealing with your own emotions.\nChildren can push their parents' buttons, and parents can sometimes lose their temper. If you find that you are constantly upset or angry with your child, you may need to take some time for yourself. Parents who take time out to relax are better able to deal with unruly children. Try taking a walk or doing some yoga when your child is napping. You might also consider seeing a therapist or parent coach.\n\nStay consistent with your discipline.\nDiscipline should be consistent, and parents should agree on how to raise their children. If one parent allows unruly behavior and the other does not, the child will be confused. This can lead to more unruliness.\nIf you and your partner are consistent, your child will eventually learn what's acceptable and what's not.",

        "In this paper, we present a novel approach to incorporate radiative transfer and the energy equation into smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of star formation. We seek to solve the problem of accurately modeling the radiative feedback from newly formed stars on their surrounding gas and dust, which plays a critical role in shaping the evolution of star-forming regions and the resulting stellar populations. \n\nOur methodology involves incorporating the equations of radiative transfer and energy conservation directly into the SPH equations of motion, using a modified version of the flux-limited diffusion approximation for radiative transfer. We validate our approach by comparing the results of our simulations with those of more traditional models that neglect radiative feedback, and find that our method significantly improves the accuracy of the simulations in reproducing observational data from star-forming regions. \n\nThe key motivation for our research is to better understand the physical processes that drive star formation and the evolution of galaxies, as well as to improve the predictive power of numerical simulations in astrophysics. By accurately modeling the radiative feedback from newly formed stars, we hope to shed light on the complex interplay between stars and their surrounding gas, and provide insights into the formation and evolution of stellar populations and galaxies.",

As the name suggests, it's all about war, and your success will depend on your ability to build, recruit, and command an army. While the specific game mechanics vary from title to title, the following tips will help you become a Total War expert.\n\nBuild your settlements\n\nThe buildings you construct in your settlements will have a profound impact on your empire. For example, farms will increase your food supply, which is essential for recruiting more units and keeping your current ones fed. Lumber mills will boost your wood supply, which is used to build more buildings and make weapons and tools. Mines will increase your income by supplying your empire with precious metals. Each building will also have an impact on your settlement's culture, so consider that when you're building a new settlement.\n\nUpgrade your settlements\n\nOnce you have a few settlements, you'll want to upgrade them to make them more valuable. Upgrading settlements will increase their income, recruitment, and defense. It will also allow you to build more buildings in that settlement.\n\nFocus on recruitment\n\nRecruiting units is essential to building your army. Every unit has a set of requirements that must be met before you can recruit them. Typically, this means you'll need to have a certain number of settlements that produce the resources the unit requires. Once you meet those requirements, you can start recruiting.\n\nIt's also important to note that every unit has a weakness and a strength. For example, infantry units are great for defending, but they're slow and can't move as quickly as cavalry units. Cavalry units, on the other hand, are great for attacking and chasing down enemies, but they can't defend as well as infantry units. Make sure you know the strengths and weaknesses of each unit before you recruit them.\n\nCommand your army\n\nOnce you have an army, you'll need to know how to command it. Every unit has a set of commands that can be given, such as \"charge,\" \"defend,\" and \" Flee.\" You'll also need to know how to use each unit's special abilities, such as the ability to set fires or create a healing vortex.\n\nIt's important to note that you can only give one command to each unit at a time. Make sure you give the right command to the right unit at the right time.",

        "How to Get an Adult Male to Use His Manners\n\nDo you feel like your partner, friend, or family member isn't showing enough manners? Are you tired of feeling neglected or unappreciated? It can be frustrating when you want someone to use their manners, but don't know how to approach the subject without causing conflict. With some preparation and communication skills, you can gently let the adult male in your life know how important his manners are to you.\n\n1. Consider what direct and indirect demands you have been making.\n\nBefore approaching the adult male about his manners, reflect on what requirements you may have been making directly or indirectly. It's possible that you have not been communicating your expectations in a clear and concise manner.\n\n2. Be prepared to evaluate your viewpoint of the situation as objectively as possible.\n\nPart of the problem when it comes to manners is that what one person sees as polite another may not. Evaluating the situation objectively will help you be more reasonable about what to expect.\n\n3. Recognize that often, men do not concentrate on the same details as women on a given conversation or situation.\n\nStudies have shown that men and women often communicate differently. This is not to say that men are incapable of displaying manners, but it does suggest that they may not always prioritise the same things as women.\n\n4. Organise your thoughts.\n\nBefore approaching the adult male, organise your thoughts to express your view effectively and ensure that you get your point across.\n\n5. Get your priorities straight.\n\nThink about what is most important to you. What is it that you want your partner, friend, or family member to improve in?\n\n6. Contemplate whether you feel the relationship has a future.\n\nIf you are thinking about this topic, it might be worth considering whether this relationship is worth pursuing. You want to evaluate whether you want to continue to invest time and energy in the relationship.\n\n7. Prepare yourself to talk to him about it if you think addressing the issue will make it better.\n\nIf you decide that you still want to pursue the relationship, it will be essential to talk about the issue.\n\n8. Let him know that there is something you would like to talk to him about.\n\nStart the conversation by letting him know that you want to talk about something that's been bothering you.\n\n9. Start the talk with saying how much he means to you and why you entered into the relationship.\n\nStarting with positive points will ease any tension and help him listen to your point of view.\n\n10. Connect the criticism to the positive things you said before by telling him something like \"I really loved when you used to .., but lately, you haven't done that anymore.\"\n\nAt this stage, try to be as calm and clear as possible.\n\n11. Be careful not to make it a nagging monologue but address certain behaviour and say clearly \"This makes me feel neglected / unattractive / not appreciated / stupid / sad.\"\n\nWhen addressing your concerns about his manners, try to speak about specific behaviours. This will make it easier for him to understand what you are asking for.\n\n12. Show him how much this means to you and that his behaviour hurts your feelings.\n\nIt's important to give him as much information as possible so that he can understand your feelings beyond the words themselves.\n\n13. Ask him to explain why he acts that way.\n\nIt's only fair to hear his perspective on the situation.\n\n14. Keep the discussion on track.\n\nTry to avoid going off-topic. This could escalate into a larger argument.\n\n15. Accept his apology if he offers one.\n\nIt's important to validate any efforts he takes and to build towards a constructive relationship.\n\n16. Take small steps with the changes.\n\nAcknowledge any effort he makes to improve his manners.\n\n17. Make changes yourself if the discussion has uncovered something you do that bothers him.\n\nIf he offers any insight into any behaviours of yours that bother him, evaluate them honestly and see what you can do to make the relationship better.\n\n18. Praise him for taking more care of you if you notice he's making an effort.\n\nFinally, be sure to show your appreciation for any progress he makes in improving his manners. Positive reinforcement is key to maintaining a healthy relationship.",

        "How to Paint Red Poinsettias in Watercolor'\n\nPainting beautiful poinsettias in watercolor can be both a challenge and a pleasure. It takes precision and patience to get perfect results. Before you can begin, you must create a basic template to ensure continuity in the painting. This article will guide you step-by-step through the process!\n\nFirst, observe your subject carefully. Make mental notes of the shape of the petals, the movement of the leaves and the texture of the background. Feel free to take pictures or draw out ideas to keep in view.\n\nPosition yourself with a sheet of 11 x 14\" watercolor paper with the subject in view. Make sure that you are sitting at the correct vantage point, and that the paper is straight and centered on a flat surface.\n\nNow draw your basic sketch. Start by drawing the petals coming from the center of each flower, with small stems about 1/2\" long emerging from under the berries. Next, sketch in the leafs, and the vase or container. All of these elements should be lightly drawn and used as a reference.\n\nBegin to paint the petals. First lay down a wet wash of a bright red color. While painting each petal, use the tip of your brush handle to scratch the vein down the center. This will give the petal texture and movement. When you are done, allow the petals to dry completely.\n\nOnce the petals have dried, add depth to them by laying a different shade of red, or by wetting them and then adding more paint. You can also use the handle of your brush again to scratch in texture. You may opt to keep some petals lighter, or to deep the shades of paint on all of them.\n\nNow for the foliage: begin to add layers of greens and blues in order to get an accurate representation of the leaves. You can make them look natural by adding varying amounts of dark and light. If you are having trouble capturing the realistic texture of the leaves, use a paper towel to dab excess paint and then blend colors to get the desired effect.\n\nWhen you are satisfied, paint in the vase. Use light and dark browns, as well as the reds and yellows you have already used. Paint the berries yellow, and when dry, mask them out for easy accessibility later on.\n\nNext, draw a line just below the midpoint of the page to separate the table from the background. This will prevent any colors from bleeding onto the surface. Feel free to add texture, and a few brushstrokes of light to the back and midground of the painting.\n\nFinally, when your painting is completely dry you may want to sign your painting, add a date, and finish up!\n\nSetting up the perfect painting of poinsettias in watercolor is possible with just a bit of knowledge and practice. The challenge of painting poinsettias in watercolor is part of the reward! Enjoy exploring these simple points of advice that will give you the chance to reach your goal! Good luck!",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Universal Substructure Distributions in LCDM halos: Can we find a Fossil Group?\".\nAbstract:\nWe study the universal substructure distribution (USSD) for dark matter halos in the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model, and its dependence on halo mass and redshift. We use high-resolution N-body simulations to calculate the USSDs at redshifts z = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 . The results show that the USSDs are independent of redshift within our numerical accuracy. However, they do depend strongly on halo mass; more massive halos have larger USSDs than less massive ones. This is consistent with previous studies based on semi-analytic models or hydrodynamic simulations. In addition, we also find that there exists an upper limit to the number density of subhalos around any given host halo. Finally, by comparing the simulated USSDs with observations, we conclude that it may be possible to detect fossil groups using future surveys such as LSST.",

        "Review of \"Words or Characters? Fine-grained Gating for Reading Comprehension\"\n\nSummary:\nThe paper proposes a fine-grained gating mechanism, which dynamically combines word-level and character-level representations based on the properties of the words. The paper extends the idea of fine-grained gating to modeling the interaction between questions and paragraphs for reading comprehension. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through experiments on a variety of datasets including the Children's Book Test, Who Did What datasets, and a social media tag prediction task.\n\nStrengths:\nThe paper is well-written and organized clearly. The introduction provides sufficient background and context, and the authors do a good job of motivating the problem. The proposed fine-grained gating mechanism is novel and effective in dynamically combining the word-level and character-level representations. The experiments are rigorous, and the authors provide detailed and insightful analysis of the experimental results, comparing their approach with various baseline methods.\n\nWeaknesses:\nOne potential weakness of the paper is that it does not compare its results with more recent state-of-the-art models for reading comprehension. The experiments use a relatively small number of training examples, which may limit the generalizability of the results.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors should compare the results of their approach with more recent state-of-the-art models for reading comprehension. The authors could also consider using a larger number of training examples to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach. Additionally, providing more insights about the trade-offs between different architectures and their impact on performance would be helpful.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, the paper presents a fine-grained gating mechanism for combining word-level and character-level representations, which achieves state-of-the-art results on several reading comprehension datasets. The proposed approach has demonstrated its effectiveness in handling complex natural language understanding tasks. The paper is well-written and contains insightful analysis of the experimental results.",

In a letter to his brother Bob, he wrote: 'For me, the point of honour is not so much that I will not take a title ... but that I will not be the first to take it. It is a point of honour with me, that I will not do anything that is not insisted upon by the people concerned, and that I will not push myself forward in any way whatever.\n\nHe also wrote that he did not want to be \"posterity's slave\".\n\nHistorians point to two other factors that might have influenced Lawrence's decision. First, he did not want to be pigeonholed into a life of conventional conformity. Second, he may have wanted to protect the reputation of his parents. His father, Bob, was an alcoholic, who had deserted his wife and children. His mother, Sarah, had brought the family up as Catholics, but after Bob left, she converted to Judaism.

        "The presence of silent letters in English words can be explained by a combination of factors, such as borrowings from foreign languages, remnants from earlier English spelling practices, and sounds disappearing from the language.\n\nThe English language has a complex history that has left its mark on the orthography of words. English has a number of borrowings from French, Latin, and other non-English languages, which show a tendency to retain original spelling patterns even when the words are pronounced differently. For example, the French word \"apaisement\" is borrowed into English as \"appeasement\" even though the final 't' is not pronounced. This is because the French pronunciation of the word came to be thought of as the correct pronunciation, so the spelling was accepted as it was.\n\nIn some cases, letter clusters in English words stem from older Germanic languages, such as Gothic and Old English. It is common for letter clusters to be retained over time, even when the sounds they represent no longer exist in the language. For example, the modern English word \"yacht\" is thought to have been derived from the Old English \"eoten,\" pronounced something like 'yat-en.' Although the distinction between 'y' and 'e' is not pronounced anymore, the original spelling has remained intact.\n\nEnglish speakers often combine words and change the pronunciation of words as well, leading to a 'disappearance' of some sounds. In such cases, the original spelling is often retained to represent an earlier pronunciation, even though the letter is not pronounced anymore. A good example of this process is the word \"sight.\" This can be traced back to an earlier form, \"sihte,\" from Old English. Although the distinction between 'i' and 'h' is no longer made, the spelling has remained the same.\n\nOverall, silent letters in English can be explained by a variety of forces, including borrowings from other languages, remnant letter clusters from older Germanic languages, and sounds disappearing from the language. Understanding the complex history of the language can help to better explain why some letters appear to be silent.",

However, the author fails to convince me of why or how HORNNs can encode higher-order information into their state transition function.

        "Ulysses S. Grant is an iconic figure of the American Civil War era, serving as the commanding general of the Union forces that defeated the Confederacy. However, some modern scholars and historians have criticized his strategic and tactical abilities, suggesting he was not as remarkable as his reputation suggests.\n\nGrant’s reputation as a military leader owes much to his remarkable success in the western theater of the war, notably in the capture of Forts Henry and Donelson, the Battle of Shiloh, the Siege of Vicksburg, and the Chattanooga Campaign. His aggressive approach and determination to win earned him the moniker “Unconditional Surrender” Grant. Yet, Grant’s reputation as a tactical genius has been challenged by modern war historians. They suggest that his victories in the western theater were due to his army’s numerical superiority, and the ineptitude of his Confederate opponents. They also point to his losses in the battles of Cold Harbor and the Wilderness, which were seen as costly mistakes.\n\nHowever, despite these criticisms, there is a compelling argument to be made that Grant was a very accomplished tactician. He effectively utilized his logistical skills to move his armies quickly, ensuring they fought in the right places at the right times. Furthermore, his brilliant strategic planning was critical in the final stages of the war, wherein he orchestrated a series of victories against the Confederacy that ensured Union victory. Grant was innovative in his tactics, using entrenchments to great effect, and his victories were the result of his shrewd analysis of the battlefield, his focus on exploiting the Confederacy’s weaknesses, and a willingness to take calculated risks.\n\nThis leaves the question of why Abraham Lincoln chose Grant to lead the Union army. Certainly, Grant had a reputation as a successful commander in the Western theater and was undeniably brave and committed. However, there were also other factors at play, namely Grant’s leadership qualities, his determination to win, and his ability to work with others. Grant had shown himself to be a team player, deferring to his superiors when necessary, and valuing the contributions of his subordinates. Lincoln appreciated these qualities and believed that Grant would be an essential leader in helping steer the Union army to victory.\n\nIn conclusion, while modern war historians may criticize Grant's strategic and tactical abilities, there is much evidence to suggest that he was indeed a skilled general. He utilized his logistical skills, strategic planning, and innovative tactics to great effect, ensuring victory for the Union in the final stages of the Civil War. Moreover, his leadership qualities and ability to work constructively with others made him an ideal candidate to lead the Union army, helping secure the fate of the United States in one of the most difficult periods of its history.",

We assume that all UTs are equipped with single RF chain which can be used to process signals received from multiple antennas simultaneously using linear processing techniques such as zero forcing or minimum mean square error criteria. The problem is formulated in terms of minimizing total power consumption subject to per-user rate constraints. It has been shown recently that the optimal solution to this problem requires joint optimization over both precoding matrices and power allocation coefficients. In order to solve this non-convex problem efficiently, we propose two algorithms based on successive convex approximation technique. First algorithm solves the original problem by iteratively optimizing over precoders and power allocations while second algorithm decouples these problems into separate subproblems and then solves them separately. Both proposed algorithms converge to the same point within few iterations. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms outperform existing schemes significantly. \n \n Keywords: Multi-user MIMO systems, Zero-forcing beamforming, Minimum Mean Square Error Beamforming",

        "A coma is a state of prolonged unconsciousness caused by an injury or disease that affects the brain. It is a serious medical condition that can result in lasting brain damage or even death if left untreated. While in a coma, the brain is in a state of reduced activity, and the person is completely unresponsive to external stimuli.\n\nThe brainstem, which controls vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure, remains functional during a coma. Therefore, the body stays alive even if the person is unconscious. However, the brain cannot process external stimuli, so even though the person is technically alive, they are incapable of interacting with the environment.\n\nThe length of a coma can vary greatly, from a few days to several months or even years. The body will wake up from a coma if and when the brain can regain normal function. When this happens, the person will slowly transition out of their comatose state and begin to regain consciousness.\n\nThere is no fixed timeline for regaining consciousness, as it largely depends on the severity of the injury or disease that caused the coma. In some cases, the person may quickly regain consciousness, while in others, it may take months or even years of rehabilitation to regain normal brain function.\n\nNeurologists and other medical professionals use several tests, including electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to monitor the brain and assess the patient's likelihood of waking up from a coma. They also monitor vital signs and other body functions to ensure the patient remains stable and receives proper care.\n\nIn conclusion, a coma is a state of prolonged unconsciousness resulting from brain injury or disease.

        "In this work, we investigate the possibility of obtaining an almost supersymmetric Standard Model from intersecting D6-branes on the Z_6' orientifold. We focus on the compactification of type IIA string theory on a toroidal background with orientifold planes. We consider a six-dimensional orbifold obtained by dividing a six-dimensional torus by a Z_6' orientation, which leads to orientifold planes and D6-branes at fixed points. We study the low-energy effective theory of the D6-branes and analyze the spectrum of chiral matter under the Standard Model gauge group. We find that the resulting spectrum contains all the particles of the Standard Model, except for the right-handed neutrinos, and that the Yukawa couplings are generated by instanton effects.\n\nOur work aims to address the problem of obtaining a realistic model of particle physics from string theory. The success of the Standard Model of particle physics in explaining the experimental data leaves little room for new physics beyond the Standard Model at low energies. String theory provides a consistent framework for quantum gravity that unifies all fundamental forces, but constructing a realistic model of particle physics from string theory is a challenging task.\n\nOur approach involves the use of intersecting D6-branes and the Z_6' orientifold, which is a particularly interesting model due to its rich phenomenology. Intersecting branes provide a geometric realization of the chiral matter spectrum, while the orientifold projection allows for the cancellation of tadpoles and the breaking of supersymmetry. Our methodology involves a detailed analysis of the low-energy effective theory of the D6-branes and the computation of instanton-generated Yukawa couplings. Our results show that a realistic model of the Standard Model can be obtained from string theory using the methods of intersecting branes and orientifolds.",

        "Jadwiga Szczawińska-Dawidowa (born Jadwiga Dżuria; 21 March 1915 – 9 April 1945) was a Polish resistance worker and member of the Polish 4th courier team, which smuggled top-secret government documents from occupied Poland to the Soviet Union, where they were passed on to the Western allies. She was arrested by the Germans and later killed by the Germans in a POW camp. She fought alongside her courier team-mates – husband Captain Dawid Nowak (codenamed \"Czaika\") and Janusz Bardańczyk (\"Mikołaj Kopernik\"), both of whom were posthumously awarded the Order of the Virtuti medal – in the early days of the Polish Defensive War and was posthumously awarded the Cross of Valour (fourth class). Szczawińska-Dawidowa's story is told in the 2011 film Oskar%C4%84 Horbach & Dawid Adamczyk: The Courier, based on the book of the same title by Maria Wodzińska. She was born in Wyszków and was brought up in Łódź, where she worked as a secretary. In 1939 she joined the Polish Socialist Youth (PPS ) and the National Workers' Party (PPS Kombat). In 1940 she began working for the organisation Ładoś, which was affiliated with the Polishresistance movement. Szczawińska-Dawidowa smuggled documents for the Polish government in occupied Poland, at great personal risk, to the Soviet Union. She was arrested by the Germans in 1943 and later killed by the Germans in a POW camp. She is buried in Góra Świętej Anny military cemetery.",
        " Write a peer review by first describing what problem or question this paper addresses, then strengths and weaknesses, for the paper An Actor-critic Algorithm for Learning Rate Learning, its main content is as below: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which updates the model parameters by adding a local gradient times a learning rate at each step, is widely used in model training of machine learning algorithms such as neural networks. It is observed that the models trained by SGD are sensitive to learning rates and good learning rates are problem specific. To avoid manually searching of learning rates, which is tedious and inefficient, we propose an algorithm to automatically learn learning rates using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we train a policy network called actor to decide the learning rate at each step during training, and a value network called critic to give feedback about quality of the decision (e.g., the goodness of the learning rate outputted by the actor) that the actor made. Experiments show that our method leads to good convergence of SGD and can prevent overfitting to a certain extent, resulting in better performance than human-designed competitors.\nThis paper is a peer-reviewed version of the following conference paper: Li, Y., & Liu, Y.

        "In this study, we investigated the high-energy threshold reaction rates on a 0.8 GeV proton-irradiated thick Pb-target. The motivation for this research was to understand the interaction between high-energy protons and thick Pb-targets, which is important for many applications in nuclear science and technology. However, previous studies have focused mainly on thin targets, and there is limited information on the reaction rates in thick targets. Therefore, our work attempts to fill this knowledge gap by performing experiments with a thick Pb-target and measuring the reaction rates using a gamma spectrometer. \n\nOur results showed that the reaction rates were much lower in the thick Pb-target compared to the thin target, due to the decrease in proton energy as it penetrates the material. We also observed some new gamma ray lines which have not been previously reported, indicating a possible reaction pathway in the thick target. Our findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of high-energy protons in thick materials, which can be used to improve the design of radiation shielding for nuclear reactors and accelerators. Overall, our work contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental physics of nuclear reactions and has practical implications for nuclear safety and radiation protection.",
        "Animals do not attempt suicide because they do not have the capacity to comprehend abstract concepts such as life, death and its finality, or the feeling of hopelessness and despair that often leads humans to consider suicide. Unlike humans, animals do not reflect on their lives, ruminate on their past struggles and anticipated future problems, or attempt to find a satisfying ending to an unsatisfactory life.\n\nHumans have the capacity to think about their lives and imagine alternate outcomes. Whether this ability is beneficial or harmful often depends on a person's mental state and psychological resilience. Animals, however, lack this capacity and thus do not experience the same level of suffering that may drive suicidal thoughts and actions. \n\nOn the other hand, animals are equipped with an instinctual survival impulse that exists regardless of their mental state, life circumstances, and perceived quality of life. This instinctual need to survive is imprinted in their genetic makeup and drive behavior such as risk-aversion, fear, and avoidance of danger - all traits that deter animals from doing anything that could jeopardize their lives such as attempting suicide. \n\nWhat's more, animals lack the physical and mental capacity to enact acts of suicide, as most animals lack more complicated cognitive functions necessary for planning and completing an act of suicide. \n\nIn addition to these instinctual and cognitive limitations, animals lack two other key components that are necessary for a person to carry out a suicidal act - an understanding of death, and the availability of lethal objects or substances. Without these two items, animals cannot make the choice to take their own life, as they do not understand the concept of death nor are they able to attain access to substances or objects that could potentially cause death. \n\nTherefore, even though animals know suffering and experience sadness, they are precluded from attempting suicide due to a combination of instinctual, mental, and physical limitations.",
        "The paper \"Cross-lingual Name Tagging and Linking for 282 Languages\" addresses the challenging task of name tagging and linking in a multilingual setting. The authors propose a cross-lingual approach to improve the performance of named entity recognition and disambiguation systems across languages.\n\nOne of the main strengths of this paper is the comprehensiveness of the approach, covering a wide range of languages and using state-of-the-art techniques to achieve high-quality results. The authors also provide detailed experimental results to support their claims, which further adds to the credibility of their approach.\n\nOne potential weakness of the paper is the lack of detail regarding the specific methods used for cross-lingual transfer learning. Although the authors provide some information about the features and models used, a more detailed explanation of the transfer learning process would improve the paper’s readability and help the reader understand the methodology more comprehensively.\n\nAnother potential limitation is that the authors do not take into account the potential limitations of their approach, such as the fact that the performance might not be the same across different languages or domains. The paper would benefit from a more nuanced discussion of any potential limitations of the approach, along with suggestions for future extensions.\n\nOverall, \"Cross-lingual Name Tagging and Linking for 282 Languages\" is a well-written paper that presents a significant contribution to the field of multilingual named entity recognition and disambiguation. The paper’s strengths outweigh its weaknesses, making it a valuable asset to the research community.",

        "In our study titled \"The Hypercube of Life: How Protein Stability Imposes Limits on Organism Complexity and Speed of Molecular Evolution,\" we investigate how the stability of proteins affects the complexity of living organisms and the speed of molecular evolution. Our motivation for this research stems from our desire to understand the underlying principles that shape the diversity of life. \n\nUsing comparative genomic analyses and molecular simulations, we explore the relationship between protein stability and organismal complexity across different branches of the tree of life. We find that the stability of proteins constrains the number of mutations that an organism can tolerate without compromising its fitness. As organisms become more complex, their proteins tend to be more stable, suggesting that the evolution of complexity is limited by the stability of biological molecules.\n\nWe also find that the speed of molecular evolution is inversely proportional to protein stability, with more stable proteins evolving at a slower rate. These results suggest that the stability of proteins is a fundamental factor shaping the evolutionary trajectories of organisms.\n\nOverall, our study sheds new light on the role that protein stability plays in shaping the diversity of life and has implications for fields ranging from evolutionary biology to biotechnology and medicine.",
        " Birlinn (Old Norse Byrlind, pronounced [byr-lin]; modern Gaelic Beirlinn) was a type of wooden ship in use in Scotland and Ireland during the Middle Ages, from the Early Middle Ages to the late 17th century. The generic term Birlinn encompassed several different types of vessels, including large cargo ships and smaller boats used for raiding, trade, or transport. The birlinn was designed as a large, multi-masted, open decked vessel with a large square rigged sail and oars for navigation in shallow waters. Its design varied between regions and over time, but it was built with a single, central mast and a square sail, a shallow draught, and was able to navigate in shallow waters due to its clinker-built construction style. By the early 16th century, birlinns were primarily made with four masts and were larger than any other wooden ship in Scotland or Ireland. Due to birlinns being constructed on land, instead of in the water, the offshore winds could be used for sails instead of relying on oars. Consequently, birlinns could travel faster and longer distances than other vessels of their age. The names birlinn and beirlinn were also used to refer to an Irish and Hebridean galley, respectively. This type of vessel was of a slightly different construction, with the central mast often being replaced by two masts and an increased sail capacity. These galley-type birlinns were used for warfare and were likely exchanged between the Gaelic kingdoms of Ireland and Scotland. They were renowned for their speed and manoeuvrability, which allowed them to outrun any other vessel they encountered. The birlinn featured prominently in medieval stories and literature of the period. It was also used in many archaeological excavations, most of which date back to the late 12th and early 13th centuries. For example, a birlinn was recovered in 2010 from Ardnamurchan Bay in Scotland. The vessel, which was likely built between 1150 and 1250, was the oldest ever found and provides valuable information on the design and construction of birlinns during this period. The birlinn has played an important role in the culture of both Scotland and Ireland, and was even used by Robert the Bruce during the Scottish Wars of Independence in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Today, modern reconstructions are being built of the historic birlinn and can still be found in many parts of the country.

        "\n\nThe lifespan of a species can be influenced by many different factors. One of the most important is the environment in which the species lives. For example, some species that live in very cold climates have longer lifespans than species that live in warmer climates. This is because the colder climate requires the species to use more energy to stay warm, which can slow down the aging process.\n\nAnother factor that can influence the lifespan of a species is the type of food that it eats. Some species that eat a diet that is high in nutrients and low in toxins can have longer lifespans than species that eat a diet that is less healthy. This is because the nutrients can help to protect the cells from damage, while the lack of toxins can reduce the amount of stress on the body.\n\nFinally, the lifespan of a species can also be influenced by its genes. Some species have genes that are better able to repair DNA damage, which can slow down the aging process. In addition, some species have genes that are more resistant to disease, which can also increase their lifespan.\n\nThe reason that humans have a longer lifespan than housecats is likely due to a combination of all of these factors. Humans have a relatively long lifespan compared to other species because we have evolved to live in a variety of different environments, we have access to a diverse diet, and we have genes that are well-suited for longevity.",
        "\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is set in 1958 New York City, and while there was certainly still segregation going on in the Big Apple at that time, it's a fact that New York was more integrated than many other American cities.  The Harlem Renaissance was at its height in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and African Americans continued to flock to New York throughout the Great Depression and beyond.  Segregationist laws like the ones we associate with the Jim Crow South were largely unenforceable in the North, although there were still plenty of places in New York that were off-limits to black people.  There were African Americans working in white-owned restaurants and bars, but it was definitely not the norm, and it's hard to say if Midge would have felt comfortable frequenting places that had never had black customers before.  It's possible that the show is taking some creative license in depicting a more integrated New York than was really the case, but the segregated parts of town are also not shown, so it's hard to say for sure.",

We find that the entanglement entropy changes non-monotonically with respect to temperature and system size. The topological entropy then decreases to half its zero-temperature value at a finite temperature. In finite-size systems, this discontinuous behavior becomes smooth. We also identify the contribution of each type of energy excitation to the topological entropy and interpret the quantum topological order as arising from a combination of both magnetic and electric closed loop structures.",
        "Hi there! So, you want to know why it's not good to put a plant in a really big pot, but it can grow really big in nature? Well, I think I might know the answer, but it might not be 100% right.\n\nYou see, when we put a plant in a pot that's too big for it, there's a lot of empty space around the roots. And that's not good because the roots need to have something to hold onto so they can grow strong and healthy. If they're just floating around in a big pot, they might get confused and not know where to go. They might even start to rot or get too much water, which can be really bad for them.\n\nBut when a plant grows in nature, it has all the soil it needs to grow big and strong. It can spread out its roots and find all the nutrients it needs. Plus, when it rains, the water can drain away and the soil won't get too soggy.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm trying to say is that plants are really smart and they need the right amount of soil to grow healthy. When we put them in a pot, we have to be careful to make sure they have enough room to grow, but not too much. That way, they can be happy and make our houses look pretty!",

        " Please write a peer review for the paper of Adding Gradient Noise Improves Learning for Very Deep Networks, its main content is as below: Deep feedforward and recurrent networks have achieved impressive results in many perception and language processing applications.  Recently, more complex architectures such as Neural Turing Machines and Memory Networks have been proposed for tasks including question answering and general computation, creating a new set of optimization challenges. In this paper, we explore the low-overhead and easy-to-implement optimization technique of adding annealed Gaussian noise to the gradient, which we find surprisingly effective when training these very deep architectures.  Unlike classical weight noise, gradient noise injection is complementary to advanced stochastic optimization algorithms such as Adam and AdaGrad. The technique not only helps to avoid overfitting, but also can result in lower training loss. We see consistent improvements in performance across an array of complex models, including state-of-the-art deep networks for question answering and algorithm learning. We observe that this optimization strategy allows a fully-connected 20-layer deep network to escape a bad initialization with standard stochastic gradient descent. We encourage further application of this technique to additional modern neural architectures.\n\nComment: This is not a peer review.\n\nComment: @D.W. I am not sure what you mean.

        "Activated charcoal, also known as activated carbon, is a form of carbon that has been treated to increase its adsorptive capacity. The activation process involves heating the carbon at very high temperatures in the presence of gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, or steam. This creates a highly porous material with a large surface area that can adsorb toxins and impurities from its surroundings.\n\nActivated charcoal has become wildly popular in the beauty/cosmetic industry due to its ability to absorb toxins and impurities that can clog pores and cause skin blemishes. It is commonly used in face masks, cleansers, and other skincare products to help detoxify the skin and leave it looking clear and smooth.\n\nIn addition to its skincare benefits, activated charcoal is also used in toothpaste and mouthwash to help whiten teeth and freshen breath. The porous surface of activated charcoal can help absorb plaque and stain-causing substances, leaving teeth looking brighter and cleaner.\n\nIt's worth noting that while activated charcoal has many benefits, it is not recommended for everyone. People with sensitive skin or certain medical conditions may experience irritation or other adverse effects from using charcoal products. As with any skincare product, it's important to patch-test new products before using them and to consult with a dermatologist if you have any concerns.",

        " Please write a peer review for the paper of Near-Data Processing for Machine Learning, its main content is as below: In computer architecture, near-data processing (NDP) refers to augmenting the memory or the storage with processing power so that it can process the data stored therein. By offloading the computational burden of CPU and saving the need for transferring raw data in its entirety, NDP exhibits a great potential for acceleration and power reduction. Despite this potential, specific research activities on NDP have witnessed only limited success until recently, often owing to performance mismatches between logic and memory process technologies that put a limit on the processing capability of memory. Recently, there have been two major changes in the game, igniting the resurgence of NDP with renewed interest. The first is the success of machine learning (ML), which often demands a great deal of computation for training, requiring frequent transfers of big data. The second is the advent of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) containing multicore processors that can accommodate extra computation for data processing. Sparked by these application needs and technological support, we evaluate the potential of NDP for ML using a new SSD platform that allows us to simulate in-storage processing (ISP) of ML workloads. Our platform (named ISP-ML) is a full-fledged simulator of a realistic multi-channel SSD that can execute various ML algorithms using the data stored in the SSD. For thorough performance analysis and in-depth comparison with alternatives, we focus on a specific algorithm: stochastic gradient decent (SGD), which is the de facto standard for training differentiable learning machines including deep neural networks. We implement and compare three variants of SGD (synchronous, Downpour, and elastic averaging) using ISP-ML, exploiting the multiple NAND channels for parallelizing SGD. In addition, we compare the performance of ISP and that of conventional in-host processing, revealing the advantages of ISP. Based on the advantages and limitations identified through our experiments, we further discuss directions for future research on ISP for accelerating ML.\n",

        " Write a peer review by first describing what problem or question this paper addresses, then strengths and weaknesses, for the paper Universality in halting time, its main content is as below: The authors present empirical distributions for the halting time (measured by the number of iterations to reach a given accuracy) of optimization algorithms applied to two random systems: spin glasses and deep learning. Given an algorithm, which we take to be both the optimization routine and the form of the random landscape, the fluctuations of the halting time follow a distribution that remains unchanged even when the input is changed drastically. We observe two main classes, a Gumbel-like distribution that appears in Google searches, human decision times, QR factorization and spin glasses, and a Gaussian-like distribution that appears in conjugate gradient method, deep network with MNIST input data and deep network with random input data. This empirical evidence suggests presence of a class of distributions for which the halting time is independent of the underlying distribution under some conditions.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/halting_time.png}\n\\caption{Halting time distributions for different optimization algorithms and random systems.

        "\n\nIf you're interested in getting into the world of fencing, you'll need to understand the terminology that comes along with it. Armed with an understanding of these basic terms, you'll be ready to take on the sport of fencing. \n\nThe first key word to understand is \"Lunge\". A lunge is an attack which involves extending the arm with the weapon towards your opponent. This is a common move in both épée and foil fencing. It can be used to score a touch, or as a setup or preparation for another move. \n\nIn foil and saber fencing, the move \"parry\" is also used. A parry is a defensive move used to deflect your opponent's attack. The type of parry used will depend on which weapon you're using and the circumstances of the bout.\n\nThe next phrase you'll hear in fencing is the French \"En garde!\". This phrase is shouted when the fencers assume the starting fencing stance. In fencing, this position is referred to as \"on guard\". It involves each fencer holding their weapon out in front of them with one hand, and the other hand behind the back, in a ready position.\n\nAt the start of a fencing match, the judge will say \"Pret!\" which is a French word meaning \"ready\". This signal gives a warning to the fencers that the match is about to begin. After this, the judge will shout \"Allez!\" which means \"go\" in French. This tells the fencers to advance and begin to fence.\n\nThroughout the bout you may hear the judge call \"Arrêt!\" which is a French word meaning \"stop\". This is a signal to the fencers to stop what they are doing, face each other and return to the on guard position after the touch is marked.\n\nThe most important word to remember during fencing is the term \"touch.\" A \"touch\" occurs when a fencer's weapon makes contact with a valid target area and is recognized by the referee. In modern fencing, it is a much welcomed alternative to the \"shocking\" methods used in the past.\n\nOnce a touch has been made, your opponent has the opportunity to \"riposte\", another French word literally meaning \"answer\". This means that they can attack you with their weapon in order to score a touch, as long as the attack comes directly after the initial touch.\n\nAnother move to be aware of is the \"disengage\". A disengage is a movement of the weapon tip underneath your opponent's weapon, and then back to where it originally was. This can be used offensively to maneuver your attacker's weapon away and score a touch, or defensively in order to successfully parry an attack.\n\nAn offensive move is commonly referred to as an \"attack\". In foil and saber fencing, an attack is any movement made with the intention of scoring a touch. In épée fencing the same holds true, though in this form of fencing there is no concept of \"right of way\", meaning that you may make an attack even if your opponent has started to do the same.\n\nThe highest ranking referee in the hall is known as the \"director\" or \"directeur\". The directeur is responsible for supervising all of the bouts, marking touches, and ensuring that all of the participants are observing the regulations of the sport.\n\nTo make sure that the touches are being scored accurately, it is important to understand fencing's target areas. In all three forms of fencing there is a valid area which can be touched in order to score, which includes the entire torso region for épée and foil, and both the torso and the head in saber.\n\nBy learning and understanding these basic terms of fencing, you'll be one step closer to understanding and taking on this wonderful sport. Whether you're just starting out, or wishing to brush up on your knowledge, equip yourself with an understanding of these basic fencing terms and you'll be ready to take on the challenge of dueling with swords.",

        "Title: Parametric Exponential Linear Unit for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\n\nThe manuscript titled \"Parametric Exponential Linear Unit for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\" presents a new variant of the exponential linear unit (ELU) activation function for deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed activation function, named parametric exponential linear unit (PELU), introduces an additional parameter alpha to control its shape. The authors demonstrate that PELU outperforms ReLU and ELU on various datasets and neural network architectures.\n\nThe paper is well-written and clearly presents the motivation, methodology, experimental results, and conclusion. The authors provide a detailed explanation of PELU and its properties, making it easy to understand for readers. The authors also provide a comprehensive experimental study on different datasets, including the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, with various neural network architectures.\n\nThe proposed activation function PELU has demonstrated superior performance compared to ReLU and ELU activation functions on the various datasets tested. The authors have also demonstrated the benefits of using PELU in deep convolutional neural networks over its counterparts in terms of training time, convergence speed, and generalization performance. These results are promising and have significant implications for the deep learning community, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing applications.\n\nOverall, this manuscript is well-structured, well-written, and clearly presents the contribution of the authors. The experimental results appear to support the authors' claims and support the superiority of PELU over other activation functions. Therefore, I highly recommend this paper for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.",

        "A quantum computer is fundamentally different from a classical computer in that it harnesses the power of quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to achieve its calculations. While a classical computer is limited to either a 0 or a 1, a quantum computer simultaneously exists in all 0s and 1s, allowing it to explore multiple paths at once and find solutions quickly. This means that a quantum computer can, in effect, try all solutions at once; however how does it decide which is correct? \n\nThe difficulty in answering this question is due to the fact that quantum computing is still a relatively new technology and a lot of the principles behind it are still being developed and refined. Essentially, once a quantum computer has attempted a task and the results are ready, the user can decide which of the solutions is the correct answer. These best solutions, or ‘quantum bits’, are found using mathematical optimization techniques such as Simulated Annealing or Quantum Search algorithms, algorithms developed specifically for use in quantum computing. The nature of simulated annealing is contingent on the user informing the computer of a certain set of rules that dictate what is an acceptable solution and what is not. \n\nThe Quantum Search Algorithm can also be used to find the solution. This algorithm is more general than Simulated Annealing as it only relies on the different levels of energy associated with the solutions rather than any predetermined constraints. All the candidate solutions are put into a ‘black box’ and the one with the lowest energy determines the optimum solution.\n\nIn conclusion, a quantum computer can indeed give the user multiple solutions with the potential to be correct; however, the user must identify the correct solution using one of the two aforementioned algorithms. By using either Simulated Annealing or Quantum Search Algorithm a user can see which result is the most optimal solution.",
        "Gabriele Münter was a prominent German painter who played a vital role in the development of expressionism, a revolutionary art movement that emerged in Germany after World War I. She was widely recognized for her use of vibrant colors, bold brushstrokes, and unconventional techniques that portrayed a vivid and emotional experience of nature, landscape, and daily life. Münter was born in Berlin in 1877 and studied at the Phalanx School in Munich. She met her lifelong partner and fellow artist, Wassily Kandinsky, in 1902, and the couple became an integral part of the early expressionist movement. Together, they founded the influential Blue Rider group, which aimed to promote avant-garde art and spirituality in the wake of industrial modernization. Münter's early works were influenced by the impressionist and fauvist styles. She often painted landscapes and still lifes, which later evolved into symbolic and surreal compositions. Her most famous painting, \"The Jawlensky Residence in Wiesbaden,\" which portrayed her former teacher and mentor, was completed in 1908 and is considered a masterpiece of early expressionism. Münter's paintings were often subject to censorship and criticism by the German authorities, who saw her work as a threat to traditional German art. As a result, she struggled to gain recognition and was forced to exhibit her work abroad. However, her influence on the art world was undeniable, and she continued to hold several solo exhibitions throughout her career. Münter's legacy remains significant in the history of modern art, particularly for her contributions to expressionism and women's art movements. She died in 1962 in Murnau, a town where she had lived and painted for over fifty years. Today, her works are widely recognized and celebrated in exhibitions and museums worldwide, including the Gabriele Münter-und Johannes Eichner Foundation in Germany, which holds the largest collection of her works.",
        "Write a long abstract of a scientific paper from arXiv.org. Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Discrete Choices under Social Influence: Generic Properties\".\nAbstract:\nWe study the generic properties of discrete choice models with social influence, where agents make decisions based on their own private information and the choices made by others in their neighborhood.  We show that if there is no correlation between individuals' private signals then any equilibrium must be symmetric across individuals (i.e., all equilibria are identical up to relabeling). If instead there exists some positive correlation among individuals' private signals, we prove that there always exist asymmetric equilibria. Finally, for intermediate levels of correlation, we provide examples showing both types of equilibria can co-exist. These results hold regardless of whether or not agents have common knowledge about each other's payoffs. \nOur analysis relies heavily on recent advances in the theory of global games. The main idea behind our approach is to view an agent's decision problem as a two-stage game played against nature. At stage one, Nature chooses her signal realization; at stage two, she makes her choice conditional on this realized signal.",

        "\n\nWe present photometric observations of the binary companions to the luminous blue variables (LBVs) SN 1987A and SN 1967G. We show that these systems contain extremely close pairs of white dwarfs in wide (8–9 days) orbit around the blue dwarf. The mass of the blue dwarf is not much greater than the mass of the white dwarf in either system. Thus, these systems are not useful for studying the evolution of field LBVs. The close white dwarf pairs are unusual and of interest in their own right, however. We discuss the possibility that the evolution of these systems has been influenced by the exchange of material between the two stars, possibly leading to the white dwarf's acquiring a significant fraction of its current mass. The accretion history of the white dwarf is probably not unique, so this may provide a mechanism for the evolution of other field LBVs. The low-mass objects in these systems may be the first examples of objects in the so-called detached object category that has been proposed as a possible route to the evolution of type I supernovae.\n\nWe have discovered a new detached binary in the planetary nebula around SN 1987A. The binary is composed of an orbital pair of white dwarfs in a widely asymmetric (80-day) orbit around a blue dwarf. The blue dwarf is slightly more massive than the white dwarfs. This is the third detached binary discovered in the last year, providing support for the hypothesis that these objects are an important stage in the evolution of massive binary systems.",

        "That is definitely a strange problem! If your dishwasher is drying all your other dishes, then it is definitely strange that your tupperware is still wet coming out of the dishwasher. Let's take a closer look to figure out why this might be happening.\n\nThe first place to start is with the dishwasher itself. Do you have a dishwasher that features a heated drying cycle? This can help dishes dry much quicker and more effectively, so if your dishwasher doesn't have this feature, that could be part of the problem. If you do have a heated drying cycle, you might want to make sure it is turned on and working properly. \n\nThe second thing to consider is your detergent. Quantity, type, and the concentration of your detergent can all play a role in how well your dishes dry. Too much detergent can leave films or other substances that leave tupperware wet, while not enough detergent won't effectively remove the food and oils from them. \n\nFinally, think about the layout and placement of your tupperware in the dishwasher. You want to make sure you aren't stacking them too tightly or placing them directly under the spray arm or spinner, as this could cause water to pool and stay in your tupperware for longer, coming out wet. You also want to verify that all seals and lids are completely closed, so that steam isn't trapped inside. \n\nIf these all look good, then you may want to look into deeper cleaning your dishwasher - clear out any debris, run a vinegar cycle, and make sure the filter is free of debris.

The authors propose a joint many-task model (JMT) that can simultaneously perform a variety of NLP tasks with a single neural network architecture. \n\nThe strength of this paper lies in the proposed JMT model’s ability to learn multiple NLP tasks concurrently, thereby making it cost-effective and efficient, especially in scenarios where NLP tasks need to be performed in a real-time setting. Additionally, the paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed model on several different NLP tasks such as semantic relatedness, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis, showing that JMT performs as well as or better than existing state-of-the-art models. \n\nHowever, one weakness of this paper is that it does not offer any insight about the relative importance of different tasks and how this might impact the performance of the overall system. Additionally, the authors could have explored the effect of adding more tasks, and the performance impact when moving from many-to-one or one-to-many tasks in detail. Lastly, the paper could have provided more a detailed explanation of the structure of the neural network architecture used in the proposed JMT model. \n\nOverall, this paper presents a well-formulated model that promises a new approach for performing multiple NLP tasks in a joint manner, while achieving state-of-the-art results. However, the paper could have benefited from additional discussion and analysis that would address some of the above-stated weaknesses.",
        "Well, that's a fascinating question. As an AI language model, I must say that I don't have an exact answer to this question, but I'll try my best to provide you with a logical answer based on my knowledge.\n\nFirst of all, let's understand the concept of the sun and water. The sun is a massive ball of gases and plasma that produces heat and light. On the other hand, water is a chemical compound composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.\n\nNow, let's imagine a massive body of water ten times the size of the sun. The first thing that comes to mind is how such a mass of water would be formed. Nevertheless, if we assume it, then yes, it would probably be able to extinguish the sun.\n\nThe reason behind this is that the sun's heat and pressure would cause the water to react and form steam, which would cause the sun's heat and light to be blocked. The sun would gradually cool down and eventually become extinct.\n\nHowever, this is just a theoretical concept, and it is unlikely to happen. The most massive body of water we would find in the universe is a gas giant, Jupiter, which only has traces of water compared to its size. Besides, the sun is enormous, and it would take an incomprehensible amount to extinguish it.\n\nIn conclusion, we can say that it is unlikely that a mass of water ten times the size of the sun could extinguish the sun. It is merely hypothetical, and the science behind it has many inconsistencies.",

        "\n\nHD 98800: A 10-Myr-Old Transition Disk\n\nWe present high-resolution observations of the disk surrounding the young solar-like star HD 98800. These data include images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that reveal the disk to be a transition disk with a diameter of approximately 80 au. We find that the disk is comprised of two distinct parts: a compact inner region with a radius of approximately 20-30 au and a more extended outer region with a radius of approximately 50-80 au. The disk is generally well-circumscribed by a rim, except for a cavity of approximately 5-10 au in radius at the position of the terrestrial planet mass companion discovered in 2005. We estimate that the mass of the disk is 41 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses) assuming a density of 1.6 g cm^3. We discuss the possible formation mechanisms for the disk and examine the potential for the disk to evolve into an analog of the solar system. We find that if the disk was formed by the accretion of planetesimals, it would have required an accretion rate of 0.01 Earth masses per Myr, similar to the rate estimated for the growth of the giant planets. We discuss the relative amounts of material in the disk and the likelihood that this disk may be the remains of a tumultuous planet formation process. We also examine the disk's habitability and find that the disk has a volatile content of approximately 0.01 Earth masses and a dust mass of approximately 0.02 Earth masses. We conclude that this disk is unlikely to be a habitable analog for the solar system, and thus is not a likely candidate for the search for extraterrestrial life. We discuss the implications of this disk for planet formation theory, and we highlight the need for further observations, both to verify our basic characterization of this disk and to better constrain the disk's properties.",

        "\n\nWe consider the duality between the two-dimensional black hole and the electromagnetic field in a strong magnetic field, which is a generalization of the well-known Fock-Zakota-Zurek (FZZ) duality to the case of a cylindrical black hole. The duality is related to the analog of the Euler-Heisenberg pendant group in the presence of a non-Abelian group symmetry. The motivation for the research is to explore the boundaries of the original FZZ-duality in the framework of the current theory, in the case of a non-rotating black hole with a mirror symmetry in the axial direction. We show that the structure of the resulting duality is similar to that of the original FZZ-duality in some aspects, but different in others. In particular, we find that the two-dimensional black hole has a twisted FZZ-like dual, which consists of a pair of surface modes living on the boundary of the two-dimensional black hole, and the bulk structure of this dual is related to the \"twisted\" bulk of the original FZZ-duality. We show that the twist angle of this dual is proportional to the golden angle. The problem this work attempts to solve is to find a generalization of the FZZ-duality to the case of a cylindrical black hole, which is motivated by the recent progress in the study of black holes with a non-Abelian group symmetry. The practical application of this work is in the field of quantum information theory, where the FZZ-duality is used to study the complexity of quantum computation with black holes. The theoretical application of this work is in the field of quantum gravity, where the FZZ-duality is used to study the relationship between the two-dimensional black hole and the electromagnetic field in a strong magnetic field.",

        "This paper estimates the power spectrum of cosmic shear, the density distortion caused by the distorsion of the gravity field of distant galaxies by the distribution of dark matter, dark energy and baryons in the universe. We use extensive simulated convergence power spectra, including the full covariance between bins, to fit a model to the data from cluster counts and cosmic shear. The resulting constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, are relatively insensitive to the choice of data set or modeling of the covariance, but the covariance remains a significant source of uncertainty. Marginalizing over this covariance, we find the 95% confidence interval w=-1.31+/-0.19 (w=-1.04+/-0.19) for a flat (closed) universe with the ratio of the energy densities of dark energy and matter, Omega_{de0}, constrained, and we measure the curvature b_{space}=-0.72+/-0.16 (b_{space}=-0.53+/-0.16). We forecast the constraining power of future surveys and find that combining cosmic shear with cluster counts will lead to a tight constraint on w (with the 95% confidence interval w=-1.00+/-0.06), while adding shear information to existing cluster surveys will only weakly improve the constraint on w (with the 95% confidence interval w=-1.15+/-0.10).",
        "This paper introduces two methods for wild variational inference. The first method, a Logdet form of Variational Bayes with neural normalization, provides a simple and flexible alternative to existing methods. The second method improves the first by letting the parameters of the normalizer be drawn from a non-standard distribution. The method has favorable empirical performance and theoretical properties. 1. Problem and motivation Variational inference is a powerful approach to Bayesian inference, but many existing approaches are difficult to apply to complex models. Existing approaches include the use of reparameterization tricks to draw from a simpler distribution, but these are limited and difficult to apply. Another popular approach is mean-field variational inference, but this method relies on conjugate posterior distributions which may not be the case for many applications. This paper introduces two methods for wild variational inference. The first method, a Logdet form of Variational Bayes with neural normalization, provides a simple and flexible alternative to existing methods. The second method improves the first by letting the parameters of the normalizer be drawn from a non-standard distribution. The method has favorable empirical performance and theoretical properties. 2. Technical description The first method uses a log-det form of the variational distribution, with a neural normalization factor (NNF) as the normalizer. The NNF allows the model to utilize simpler distributions, while the log-density form permits the use of gradients. The second method improves on the first by letting the parameters of the NNF be drawn from a non-standard distribution. The method allows the model to utilize a more expressive normalizer. Both methods provide simple extensions to existing work, with favorable empirical performance. 3. Strength and weakness The first method provides a simple extension to existing work. The method has favorable empirical performance, and is easily applied to a wide range of models. The second method has the potential for favorable theoretical properties. However, the method has not been theoretically analyzed. Overall, both methods provide simple and flexible approaches to variational inference. The first method has favorable empirical performance and the second has the potential for favorable theoretical properties. 4. Further reading This paper introduces two methods for wild variational inference. The first method, a Logdet form of Variational Bayes with neural normalization, provides a simple and flexible alternative to existing methods. The second method improves the first by letting the parameters of the normalizer be drawn from a non-standard distribution. The method has favorable empirical performance and theoretical properties. One common challenge when applying variational Bayesian techniques to neural networks is the lack of conjugacy. One common approach for addressing this issue is to apply reparameterization tricks to draw from a simpler distribution. However, these are limited and difficult to apply. Another popular approach is mean-field variational inference, but this method relies on conjugate posterior distributions which may not be the case for many applications. This paper introduces two methods for wild variational inference. The first method, a Logdet form of Variational Bayes with neural normalization, provides a simple and flexible alternative to existing methods. The second method improves the first by letting the parameters of the normalizer be drawn from a non-standard distribution. The method has favorable empirical performance and theoretical properties. Overall, the first method provides simple and flexible approaches to variational inference. The first method has favorable empirical performance and the second has the potential for favorable theoretical properties. Overall, both methods provide simple and flexible approaches to variational inference. The first method has favorable empirical performance and the second has the potential for favorable theoretical properties. 5. Future work One limitation of the first method is that the normalizer is a normalizing constant, which makes its computation challenging. It is possible that a solution to this problem could be found by utilizing a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. Another direction for future work would be to apply the first method to a model with a more expressive normalizer. Overall, one potential direction for future work is to solve the normalizer issue. Additionally, it would be interesting to see if the first method could be applied to a model with a more expressive normalizer. Overall, both methods provide simple and flexible approaches to variational inference. The first method has favorable empirical performance and the second has the potential for favorable theoretical properties. 6. Conclusions The first method provides a simple extension to existing work. The method has favorable empirical performance, and is easily applied to a wide range of models.

        "The CIA has long been accused of involvement in the crack epidemic, or more specifically the agency’s funneling of cocaine money to help fuel the crack epidemic in the 1980s. Although the accusation has been around for decades, it gained traction in the 2000s with the help of groups like the New York City Black and Latino Society and the city’s elected officials, who started running advertisements denouncing the claim as a “myth”. In response to the advertisements, Republicans in Congress held hearings on the subject, and even the New York Times published an editorial stating that “The case for the crack epidemic, in one paragraph”, based on the hearing testimony of psychologist Richard Gardner, a key accuser of the CIA. In 2010, a panel of the National Research Council of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report on the matter. The report, however, found little evidence of a direct funneling of funds by the CIA to fuel the crack epidemic. Rather, the report concluded that “influential politicians, social activists, and journalists played a central role in propagating the myth of a crack epidemic“. This all begs the question of what role, if any, the CIA actually played in fueling the crack epidemic. After all, the agency did play a pivotal role in escalating the global war on drugs in the 1980s, and crack could easily be described as a “street drug”. It’s important to point out that there’s little question that the drug trade exacerbated the crack epidemic in the 1980s. What is uncertain is whether the CIA actually had any direct role in causing the epidemic, as opposed to simply failing to act when influential people it was involved with were bringing crack to the poorest neighborhoods in America.",
        "This paper addresses the problem of acquiring an interpretable and generalizable function learning network, rather than just identifying a suitable function from a hypothesis set in machine learning. Specifically, the goal is to learn analytical expressions and extrapolate to unseen domains using a novel type of function learning network called Equation Learner (EQL). The paper introduces this network as an end-to-end differentiable feed-forward network that allows for efficient gradient based training and sparsity regularization to obtain concise and interpretable expressions.\n\nOne strength of this paper is that it proposes a new approach to machine learning problems that seeks interpretable and generalizable solutions. This is important in fields where understanding the mechanism connecting inputs and outputs is a critical aspect. Moreover, the EQL network is shown to be effective in identifying concise and interpretable expressions that are more likely to reflect the true underlying source expression.\n\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses in this paper that need to be addressed. One of the limitations is that the EQL network is not compared to other types of function learning networks, making it difficult to understand its advantages over existing approaches. Another issue is that the paper does not provide details on how the network behaves under different experimental settings, such as varying the size of the input data or tuning hyperparameters.\n\nTo conclude, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning by proposing a novel approach to function learning that prioritizes interpretability and generalization. Nonetheless, the paper could be improved by including more detailed comparisons with other approaches and providing more information on how the EQL network behaves across different settings.",

        " Please write a peer review for the paper of Gated-Attention Readers for Text Comprehension, its main content is as below: In this paper we study the problem of answering cloze-style questions over documents. Our model, the Gated-Attention (GA) Reader, integrates a multi-hop architecture with a novel attention mechanism, which is based on multiplicative interactions between the query embedding and the intermediate states of a recurrent neural network document reader. This enables the reader to build query-specific representations of tokens in the document for accurate answer selection. The GA Reader obtains state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks for this task--the CNN \\& Daily Mail news stories and the Who Did What dataset. The effectiveness of multiplicative interaction is demonstrated by an ablation study, and by comparing to alternative compositional operators for implementing the gated-attention.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The paper is well written and easy to read.\n\\item The paper is well organized and the content is clear.\n\\item The paper is well written and easy to read.\n\\item The paper is well organized and the content is clear.\n\\item The paper is well written and easy to read.\n\\item The paper is well organized and the content is clear.\n\\item The paper is well written and easy to read.\n\\item The paper is well organized and the content is clear.\n\\item The paper is well written and easy to read.\n\\item The paper is well organized and the content is clear.\n\\item The paper is well written and easy to read.\n\\item The paper is well organized and the content is clear.\n\\item The paper is well written and easy to read.\n\\item The paper is well organized and the content is clear.\n\\item The paper is well written and easy to",

        "\n\nHow to Stop a Cat from Scratching the Couch\nScratching is a normal and healthy feline behavior, but it can be frustrating when your favorite chair or the arms of your couch become a target. Fortunately, you can train your cat to stop scratching the furniture and other unwanted places.\n\nUnderstand why cats scratch.\nCats have a natural instinct to scratch. This behavior helps them to remove the dead outer layer of their claws, to keep their claws sharp and healthy, and to mark their territory. \n\nProvide alternative scratching surfaces.\nIf you want to stop your cat from scratching the couch, you should provide alternative options. This will allow your cat to continue the behavior in a more appropriate place. The best thing to do is buy a scratching post or pad and place it near the couch. Your cat will probably be more interested in the new scratching post if you place it in the same spot where it used to scratch the couch.\n\nEncourage your cat to use the scratching post.\nWhen you see that your cat is using the scratching post, reward this behavior with lots of affection or a treat. This will help to reinforce the behavior you want to see in your cat.\n\nUse deterrents to stop unwanted scratching.\nWhen you see that your cat is about to scratch the couch, try to stop it by using a deterrent. You can use a noise deterrent, such as a cat scare, to make a loud noise that will startle the cat and prevent it from scratching. You can also use a taste deterrent, such as bitter apple, to make the couch taste unpleasant to the cat.\n\nBe consistent with the training.\nTo stop a cat from scratching the couch, you will need to be consistent with the training. This means using the deterrent every time you see the cat scratching the couch, and rewarding the cat when it uses the scratching post. With consistent training, your cat will eventually learn that scratching the couch is no longer acceptable.",
        "This paper shows that sparse coding with regularization can be addressed as an optimization problem and provides an efficient algorithm to solve it. The proposed algorithm uses the alternating direction method of multipliers. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform state of the art sparse coding algorithms in terms of reconstruction error and running time. The paper is well written with clear explanations. The topic is an important one but it is still an emerging field so that there are not that many papers available for readers to review. Thus it does not have that many citations yet. However, the topic is very promising and the results achieved so far are very good. Thus I expect the topic to grow in popularity in the near future and more such papers will be available for reviewers. I recommend accept the paper for the the above reasons, but leave the comments below to guide the author in preparing the paper for publication. Major comments: 1. The code is only for the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and not for other algorithms such as gradient descent for solving the same problem. The code should be expanded to include other algorithms. 2. The code assumes that the variables be declared as matrices. This could be relaxed to allow vectors as well. 3. Although the author shows that the proposed algorithm can outperform state of the art sparse coding algorithms in terms of reconstruction error and running time, it does not prove that it provides optimal solution to the problem. It would be good to show that the proposed algorithm indeed provides optimal solution in the case of sparse coding. Minor comments: 1. It might be helpful to include a diagram that depicts the network or connect the equations in the paper with arrows so that it is easier to understand the flow of information. 2. The third paragraph of the introduction could be rewritten to provide a clear introduction to the topic. 3. The fourth paragraph of the introduction could be combined with the third one. 4. In the first table, the values of the parameters should be included in the table. 5. In the third table, the values of the parameters should be included in the table. 6. In the fourth table, the values of the parameters should be included in the table. 7. In the second line of the second paragraph, \"the gradient descent\" is repeated. 8. In the second paragraph, the authors should compare their algorithm to other popular regularization techniques such as Tikhonov regularization. 9. In the second paragraph, the term \"equivalent\" might be clearer to others if the reader is told what it means. 10. In the fifth paragraph, the statement \"subject to the constraint\" might be made clearer by restating the constraint in the form of an equation. 11. In the fifth paragraph, the statement \"satisfy\" might be made clearer by restating it in the form of an equation. 12. In the second sentence of the fourth paragraph, \"as it has to be done\" might be replaced by \"as it was done\" 13. In the first sentence of the fifth paragraph, \"the same\" might be replaced by \"the same parameters\" 14. The first and second sentence of the fifth paragraph should be compared to similar sentences in the third and fourth paragraph. They are nearly identical. 15. The paragraph beginning \"The scaling constant\" is very difficult to parse. The sentence beginning with \"The gamma\" should be rewritten using simpler terms. 16. In the first line of the seventh paragraph, \"are found\" should be replaced by \"are determined\" 17. In the second sentence of the seventh paragraph, \"if the\" might be replaced by \"if\" 18. In the second sentence of the eighth paragraph, \"if the\" might be replaced by \"if\" 19. In the second sentence of the ninth paragraph, \"if the\" might be replaced by \"if\" 20. The first sentence of the tenth paragraph is ambiguous. It might be rewritten to make it clear what the sentence is about. 21.

        " The 1975 Peach Bowl was a college football game between the Texas Tech Red Raiders and the Georgia Bulldogs that took place on December 31, 1975. The game was the final competition of the 1975 NCAA Division I football season and was the only bowl game ever played between teams from the Big Eight Conference and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The game was played at the Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Texas Tech, champions of the Big Eight Conference, defeated the Southeastern Conference (SEC) co-champion Georgia Bulldogs, 17–14, to win the game. The 1975 Peach Bowl was the only bowl game the Red Raiders played in while a member of the Big Eight, as they had agreed to participate in the 1976 Fiesta Bowl as part of their move to the Southwest Conference the following year. It was the first of many bowl games the Red Raiders would play in under head coach Steve Sloan. Georgia was the first SEC team to play in the Peach Bowl. The Bulldogs had a 7–5 record and were co-champions of the SEC East Division, finishing with a 5–1 conference record, alongside the Tennessee Volunteers and the Kentucky Wildcats. This was the Bulldogs' only appearance in the Peach Bowl; they would go on to play in the Sugar Bowl seven times in the following years. The game was the last one for Georgia's Vince Dooley as the team's head coach; he would be replaced by Ray Goff the following year. It was also the final game for more than 20 Georgia players, as the team had seniors on both sides of the ball. Texas Tech was making its second bowl appearance in school history and its first since the 1971 Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl, when the Red Raiders defeated the Houston Cougars, 27–7. Texas Tech was 7–5 overall and 5–2 in Big Eight Conference play, finishing in second place in the conference behind the Nebraska Cornhuskers. The game was the first of eight bowl appearances the Red Raiders would make in a nine-year span, including six New Year's Day bowl games. Texas Tech would win five of those eight bowl games, including four straight wins from 1978 to 1981.",
        "\nIn this study, we assess the role of planetesimal accretion in the formation of gaseous protoplanets. We outline a sequence of events wherein the transition from small planetary cores to fully-fledged protoplanets can be modulated by residual planetesimals. Evaluation of the mean motion resonances shows that planetesimals cannot pass through these structures, thereby allowing gas to be accreted with little disruption. However, as the protoplanet grows, the resonances overlap, creating an environment for planetesimals to become dynamically unstable. The ensuing gas drag resulting from this instability triggers the migration of planetesimals, which in turn produces a massive bombardment of the protoplanet's surface. Through this mechanism, we explain the discrepant core-envelope structures found in Jupiter and Saturn, as well as the metallic abnormality of many known transiting exoplanets.",
        " The 2014 Mae Lao earthquake occurred on May 9, 2014 at 10:24 pm local time (17:24 UTC) in the northern part of Thailand, near the border with Laos. The epicenter was located near the towns of Ban Hang Lek and Ban Hang Pak Lat in Mae Lao District, Uttaradit Province. The M6.3 earthquake is the strongest recorded to have hit the country since 1969. The earthquake was felt throughout northern Thailand, as well as parts of Laos, northern Myanmar, and southeastern China. The government of Thailand stated that the maximum intensity reached in Mae Lao district was VII on the Mercalli intensity scale. More than forty people were reported injured in the region, with local sources claiming up to seventy injuries in total. Several buildings were damaged in the district, including some schools and temples. Immediately after the quake, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra sent officials to Uttaradit Province to assess the damage and oversee relief efforts. Monetary aid was sent to help mitigate further potential damage to buildings, and Yingluck also sent doctors and other medical staff to support the injured. Shortly afterwards, a committee was formed to examine the long-term damage caused by the earthquake and create a recovery plan. At the time, seismologists from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) claimed that the low magnitude of the earthquake likely meant minimal risk of a tsunami. Nevertheless, a tsunami alert was issued for the Andaman Sea, and people in the districts of Tak and Phang Nga, both of which are coastal provinces, were evacuated as a precaution. The USGS reported that aftershocks from the Mae Lao earthquake occurred on May 9 and 10, largely ranging from M3 to M4.5 in magnitude. Some geologists believe that the Mae Lao earthquake was caused by a complex system of faults in the region, yet no consensus has been reached on the exact cause. Additionally, seismologists are still researching the role that earthquakes play in the larger tectonic activity of the region.",
        " Please write a peer review for the paper of Decomposing Motion and Content for Natural Video Sequence Prediction, its main content is as below: We propose a deep neural network for the prediction of future frames in natural video sequences. To effectively handle complex evolution of pixels in videos, we propose to decompose the motion and content, two key components generating dynamics in videos. Our model is built upon the Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Neural Network and Convolutional LSTM for pixel-level prediction, which independently capture the spatial layout of an image and the corresponding temporal dynamics. By independently modeling motion and content, predicting the next frame reduces to converting the extracted content features into the next frame content by the identified motion features, which simplifies the task of prediction. Our model is end-to-end trainable over multiple time steps, and naturally learns to decompose motion and content without separate training. We evaluate the pro- posed network architecture on human activity videos using KTH, Weizmann action, and UCF-101 datasets. We show state-of-the-art performance in comparison to recent approaches.

        "\nBy applying Fourier analysis, we examine the dynamic relationship between the chromosphere and the transition region of active-region plage, whether it is mossy or non-mossy. We utilize image sequences gathered by the Transition Region And Coronal Explorer (TRACE) in different ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet passbands. The results of this analysis show that in the non-mossy plage, there is a zero phase difference between 1550 and 171 A. For mossy plage, there is an inclined trend in the phase difference spectra when the frequency rises, with no phase difference beyond the 4-6 mHz rate. The phase difference diagrams between 171 and 195 A is unusually shallow at 3 mHz and then again turns to no phase difference afterwards. We believe that the same resemblance between the UV and EUV bands are credited to the collaboration of the C IV resonance lines in 1550 and 1600 A, whereas the steep incline in the low frequencies make evident the presence of upward-travelling disturbances. This trend turning to zero phase difference at greater frequencies is likely due to the obscuration of the hot loop's foot points by oscillating fibrils in the higher frequencies. With these results, it may be suggested that there is a connection between chromospheric and coronal heating mechanisms that involves the slow-mode magnetosonic disturbance.",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Hot Nights on Extrasolar Planets: Mid-IR Phase Variations of Hot Jupiters\".\nAbstract:\nWe present the first mid-infrared phase curve observations for an extrasolar planet, WASP-121b (1SWASP J140747.93-394542.7), using Spitzer/IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. The data were taken in two epochs separated by one year to allow us to search for any changes in the system's properties over time. We find that the amplitude of the phase variation is consistent with previous measurements made in the optical but we detect no significant change between our two epochs. This suggests that there are no large variations in the temperature structure or composition of this planet as it orbits its host star. Our results also show that the planet has a very high albedo in both bands which may be due to clouds and/or haze. These findings have important implications for understanding how planets form and evolve. \n \n Keywords: exoplanet, infrared",
        "Li and Rb are two alkali metal isotopes that exhibit a multitude of temperatures when exposed to thermal radiation from a reservoir. The two isotopes, when isolated from the reservoir of radiation, reach an effective quantum ground state corresponding to a zero-temperature collective state. We demonstrate thermalization of both isotopes to their effective ground state at finite temperature, via a combination of photon scattering and magnetic field control of population and internal state. We also extend the method to atoms with multiple ground states, in this case $^7$Li and $^{87}$Rb, achieving efficient coupling to a single phonon mode in each case. Our results represent a landmark in sympathetic cooling of atoms to temperatures far below the typical modes of a reservoir, and a path to reaching the quantum ground state of multiple species of atoms via a combination of laser cooling and magnetic control. Our two-photon Raman scheme allows for efficient, on-demand coupling of Li and Rb atoms to the deep optical molasses (Doppler) state atoms. First, we address cooling to the ground state by coupling to a single phonon mode, the scissors mode, using a pair of Raman lasers tuned to the $2\\,^2S_{1/2} \\rightarrow 2\\,^2P_{3/2}$ and $2\\,^2P_{1/2} \\rightarrow 2\\,^2S_{1/2}$ transitions. The scissors mode is a collective motion of Li and Rb atoms with zero point energy equal to $k_B\\times$288nK, where nK is the temperature in units of 0.1K. We characterize the temperature of the scissors mode by coupling to this mode and measuring the change in momentum distribution of the atoms, finding the mode temperature to be $288\\pm29$nK. We then achieve quantum ground state temperatures of Li and Rb by transferring population to the quantum ground state using three Raman lasers and an adiabatic rapid passage (ARap) technique. We measure the final state purity, which approaches unity, as well as the entropy of the system, which we calculate to be equivalent to the zero-point energy of the scissors mode. Finally, we cool $^{87}$Rb to the zero-point energy of the scissors mode by repeating the process starting from the ground state. We find a total entropy reduction of $21.4\\pm0.8$nK in three cooling stages. We use a reservoir of radiation to set the atoms’ temperature. We demonstrate that Li and Rb reach their effective quantum ground state at finite temperature through scattering of thermal radiation. We isolate Li in the $2\\,^2S_{1/2}$ ground state and Rb in $2\\,^2P_{1/2}$ and $2\\,^2P_{3/2}$ ground states, and couple the atoms to the vacuum of a cavity via a dipole coupling to a mechanically compliant rod near the cavity",
        "Lucius Cary, 6th Viscount Falkland, was a British politician, author, and philosopher. He was born on August 1610 in Burford, Oxfordshire and died on September 20, 1643, at the Battle of Newbury. He played an important role in English political and literary circles during the early 17th century. Cary was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, where he met and became close friends with the poet John Milton. In 1632, he became a member of parliament for Newport in Cornwall and later represented the constituency of Great Bedwyn. Cary was a supporter of King Charles I, but he never held a significant position in his government. Cary was also a prolific author and a leading figure in the intellectual movement known as the Caroline Circle. His most famous work is the essay \"Of the Inconstancy of Witches,\" which argued against the persecution of witches. He also wrote \"Epitaph on William Shakespeare\" and \"On the Death of Ben Jonson.\" His philosophical work, \"A Discourse of Inevitable Necessity,\" which defended free will and argued against determinism, was highly influential. Cary was admired by his contemporaries for his intelligence, eloquence, and integrity. He was known for his kindness and generosity, especially towards younger writers and scholars. His untimely death at the Battle of Newbury, at the age of 33, was a great loss to the English literary and political world. Cary's legacy continues to be celebrated today. His literary works are still read and studied, and his philosophical ideas have had a lasting impact. The town of Burford has a memorial to him, and a street in London's Holborn is named after him. Cary was a significant figure in a turbulent period of English history, and his contributions to literature and philosophy remain invaluable.",

        "\n\nMaking your own Vanilla Beer is a great way to enjoy a unique and flavorful craft beer without the expensive price tag that often comes with craft beer. You don't need any special equipment to make homebrewed beer, but it is important to clean and sterilize all the equipment you use so that you don't ruin the flavor of the beer. Here's what you need to do to make your own Vanilla Beer:\n\n1. Fill the Fermenting Bucket with cool tap water. Before you start, make sure to sanitize the fermenting bucket using Clorox® or another suitable sanitizing product.\n\n2. Add the Clorox® to the water in the Fermenting bucket. The amount needed will depend on the size of the fermenter so make sure to double check the directions for the particular product you are using.\n\n3. Put all of your tools into the fermenting bucket. This should include a large spoon, funnel, siphon tube, and strainer.\n\n4. While the tools are sanitizing, add 2 quarts of the bottled water to the saucepan and bring to a boil.\n\n5. Use some of your Clorox® to sanitize the work area. This is important to do so that you don't contaminate the beer.\n\n6. After 30 minutes remove all the tools. Make sure to discard the Clorox®/water solution once you are done.\n\n7. Add 1 Cup Sugar to the boiling water in the saucepan. This will provide the necessary food source for the yeast.\n\n8. Add the ice and one gallon of the bottled water to the fermenting bucket. Stir until the mixture begins to cool to room temperature.\n\n9. Pour in the sugar water mix from the saucepan. This will add the necessary sugar for the yeast to start fermenting.\n\n10. Use the remaining bottled water to bring the water level up to approximately 11 Quarts.\n\n11. Place the fermenter in a cool, dark place for 7-14 days. During that time the beer will be fermenting and creating carbon dioxide.\n\n12. After Fermenting, Put 1 teaspoon of Clorox® in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. This solution will be used to sanitize each bottle before bottling the beer.\n\n13. Bring back your saucepan and put 3oz of sugar into enough water to give each bottle 1 tablespoon. This solution will be used to add carbonation to the beer.\n\n14. Bring out the fermenter. Using the siphon tube, begin transferring the beer into the bottles.\n\n15. Put a box on the floor, or a lower surface, where you can use the tubing to fill each bottle. This will make it easier to monitor the amount of beer you are transferring into each bottle.\n\n16. Fill each bottle up to about an inch from the top.\n\n17. Stash the bottles for at least 7 days. This will give the beer enough time to carbonate and conditioning.\n\nOnce the 7 days has passed, your Vanilla Beer is ready to be served. Enjoy your unique and flavorful craft beer. Cheers!",

        "Despite the seemingly minor impact of a plague of frogs, their significance in ancient Egyptian culture cannot be understated. Frogs were seen as symbols of fertility, abundance, and prosperity in Egyptian mythology. They were also associated with the goddess Heket, who was believed to have created the first frogs out of the mud of the Nile. As such, frogs were considered sacred and protected animals in Egyptian society.\n\nThe use of battletoads, or frogs, in the plagues inflicted upon Egypt was therefore highly symbolic and deeply meaningful. It was a direct attack on the Egyptian gods and their power. By unleashing plagues of frogs, God was demonstrating his superiority over the gods of Egypt, who were believed to have control over the natural world.\n\nFurthermore, the plagues of frogs had very real agricultural implications. The sudden influx of frogs would have disrupted the delicate balance of the ecosystem and damaged the crops that the Egyptians relied upon for sustenance. The Nile River, which was central to their way of life, would have been overrun with the creatures, making it nearly impossible to use for irrigation and transportation.\n\nIn this way, the plagues of frogs were a devastating blow to the very heart of Egyptian society. They were a symbol of God's power and authority, and a demonstration of his ability to control the natural world. While they may seem like a minor inconvenience compared to other plagues, their impact on ancient Egypt cannot be ignored.",
        "Tracing debtors can be a difficult task, but with the right tools and effort, it is possible to gather the necessary information to pursue them in court. The first thing to do is to speak directly to the debtor, for this you will need to have been smart at the start of the business relationship, time after time firms carry out hundreds if not thousands of pounds worth of work for a client or customer without having all the customers contact details. Once you have all this information you need to check it, try different numbers to contact your customer so in the event of them not paying you can get in touch with them quickly and resolve any matters before they escalate. When calling a debtor make sure you try at different times of the day, if you only call at one particular time and receive no answer then this could simply be because the debtor is working at that particular time. If you still receive no response it is worth following up on one of the above actions but if you wish to persist then the next step is to confirm that they are still at the address. Assuming that the debtor is still residing at the address it is time to follow up the threats with some action, you need to instruct a debt collection agency or solicitor to collect the debt on your behalf because you have run out of other legal options. If the debtor has moved it can become very difficult especially if they have moved within the last three months, this is because it takes around this amount of time for the debtor to start showing at the new address. The best piece of advice is to collect as much information about the person when they are prepared to give you it i.e., Finally good luck with any trace and collect work you undertake.",
        "In Medieval Europe, women did not own their own bodies. Instead, they were owned by a husband or male relative. This was especially true of women who were serfs. A serf is a person who is tied to a specific plot of land and has no financial independence. If a serf woman was very pretty, it is possible that the man who owned her land would take her as his wife. However, if the woman was married to someone else, her new husband would still technically own her. In addition, it is possible that the woman’s parents, siblings, and other relatives could own her as well. In short, women in Medieval Europe were not able to fully control their own lives, even if they were very pretty. It is worth noting that serfdom was not unique to the Middle Ages. Slavery has been part of human society for thousands of years. Throughout history, certain people were considered “slaves” because they were not allowed to own property or make decisions for themselves. In modern times, slavery has been completely abolished. However, slavery-like conditions have occurred throughout the world throughout history, including in the Middle Ages.",

        "\n\n\nHow to Make a Motorcycle Diaper Cake\nMaking someone a motorcycle diaper cake is an easy and fun way to surprise a new or expectant mother. It's a creative and innovative way to give a birthday gift or baby shower gift that's sure to be appreciated. Not only is it a wonderful gift, but it will give the expectant mom something to decorate her nursery with. Follow the tips below to create a motorcycle diaper cake that's sure to be a hit!\n\nPurchasing the Requirements\nThe first step to making a motorcycle diaper cake is to purchase the items needed for the cake. Depending on your budget, you may opt to buy all the items in one store or shop around for the best deals. A list of required items includes: \n• diapers \n• decorative ribbon \n• two receiving blankets \n• one baby bib \n• one stuffed toy \n• one baby bottle \n• one ring toy \n• two baby socks \n• tissue paper \n\nAssembling the Cake\nOnce you have all the required items for assembling the motorcycle diaper cake, it's time to start the process. Begin by lining the cake pan with several folded diapers. You'll want to layer the diapers until you have about two inches on the sides of the pan. Secure the diapers in place so they don't fall out when you remove the cake from the pan.\n\nNext, remove the cake from the pan and carefully place it on a hard surface. Place the second diaper tire inside the first diaper tire and then wrap both tires with almost all of the decorative ribbon. Leave the end of the ribbon uncut so that you can secure the diaper \"tires\" together.\n\nNext, begin assembling the handlebars for the motorcycle. To do this, fold one of the receiving blankets in half length-wise and roll it into a very tight roll. Then slide the roll through the diaper tire hole. Stand the diaper tire on its side (so that it looks like a tire) and then fold the second blanket in half length-wise. Place the blanket into the opening of the front tire and then pin the bib (motorcycle's seat) to the top of the front diaper tire.\n\nTo finish the handlebars, hold the ends of the front diaper tire blanket upward and then insert the baby bottle (the motorcycle's dashboard) above the bib and underneath the ring toy (the motorcycle's mirror). Create more definition and strength in the handlebars by stuffing the baby socks with a small amount of tissue paper to puff up the garment. Once this is done, top the handlebars with one sock on each side. \n\nThe Final Touches\nThe last step is to add the decorations to the motorcycle diaper cake. Add the second bib to the back diaper tire the same way you added the first bib to the front. Then, prop the stuffed toy on top so it appears that the toy is riding the motorcycle. Finally, add additional decorative ribbon to the bottom of the diaper to give the cake a more finished appearance.\n\nCongratulations! You have now created a unique, creative and memorable motorcycle diaper cake that the expectant mom is sure to love. Anyone can make a motorcycle diaper cake - just a little bit of creativity, some of the required items, and a few simple steps and you have a finished product that is sure to be appreciated.",
        "The classical Chinese concept of the west was heavily influenced by two main sources: direct experience of Persian military might and the wealth of Information that flowed along the highly lucrative silk road. Due to Persia's westward expansion, Chinese maps from this time period frequently feature dotted outlines of the Persian empire. Beyond that, Chinese cartographers were also able to provide themselves with a fairly detailed understanding of Persia through referencing their own history and other accounts from the time. What was understood about the Greek city-states? Much like Persia, the Greeks were also seen as a potent military power and excellent inventor. It is interesting to note that while the Chinese were very familiar with the famed exploits of Alexander the Great, the Greeks did not prove as notorious in the chinese vernacular until much later. The far east was very familiar with Greek culture through direct trade, and the famous philosopher Plato was a pupil of Socrates, who was famously active in China. Chinese writings also frequently reference concepts from Greek philosophy. The inclusion of Greek geometry into the original epigraphical formula of the great wall is another example of this transmission of knowledge. As for the Romans, chinese visitors to Rome in this period were extremely surprised by just how sophisticated Rome's civilization seemed to them. While they were very familiar with the Greeks, the Romans stood out as a much more novel idea. The Chinese wrote down an extremely detailed description of a visit to Rome in one period book, complete with detailed descriptions of buildings, sculpture and military equipment. While the far east was familiar with the Iron Age kingdoms of Europe, the Roman influence would really only become fully understood much later, after the fall of the Roman empire.",
        "\nThis article presents a hydrodynamical algorithm as a tool to study astrophysical detonations, with a specific aim of simulating the carbon detonation that occurs in a superburst event. The algorithm is based on the MUSCL scheme of van Leer and is second-order accurate. Tests performed using the algorithm demonstrate it to be reliable. Preliminary one-dimensional studies show that the carbon detonation process is a multi-scale phenomenon, with the liberation of energy occurring on a length scale $10^6$ times smaller than the total reaction length. It is suggested that a multi-resolution approach can be used to tackle all the reaction lengths. Thermodynamic and composition profiles for different layers of carbon, iron and helium relevant to superbursts are also provided.",
        " Survivor (franchise) is the world's largest reality competition franchise. It was created in 2000 by producer Charlie Parsons and was developed by Mark Burnett for the American television network CBS. The premise of the series involves contestants, known as Survivors, competing in challenges and strategizing to outwit each other in order to be the last one standing and become the Sole Survivor. The show has spawned 35 versions in more than 40 countries around the globe, making it one of the most successful franchises in television history, with over 500 million viewers worldwide. The original version of Survivor, Survivor: Borneo, saw 16 castaways attempt to outlast each other in physical and mental challenges, and strategically form alliances, for 39 days. After being marooned on the remote tropical location, the castaways were forced to survive on their wits with few food and supplies beyond a few simple tools. The series was met with high ratings, which eventually spawned numerous international versions, spin-offs, and board games. Since debuting in 2000, the series has seen countless evolutions, most notably introducing twists to the basic format, such as Redemption Island, Exile Island and hidden immunity idols. Additionally, each version offers its own culturally-specific civilization building challenges and rewards, allowing each show to tailor to its individual audience. The franchise has also won multiple awards, including an Emmy Award, four Critics' Choice Awards, an International Emmy Award and a Golden Globe. It has also been credited with helping to launch the career of several former contestants, including Sandra Diaz-Twine, who became the only two-time champion on the United States version of the show; Yul Kwon, who competed on the thirteenth season and later becoming the host of ABC’s Primetime: What Would You Do; and Richard Hatch, the original winner of Survivor: Borneo. In addition to the television series, the Survivor franchise encompasses a wide range of merchandise, from board games and shirt to DVDs, books and even video games. With its iconic \"Outwit, Outplay, Outlast\" tagline and its impact on modern television, Survivor has become a worldwide sensation and has established itself as one of the most successful and enduring franchises of all time.",
        "While it is true that deep, deep nets with many layers tend to perform better on many CNN tasks, it is not always the case. Depth doesn't always mean quality. For example, segmentation of mammalian organs sometimes fails with very deep nets due to the complexity of the decision boundaries, and plain nets with some pre-trained reused layers can achieve very good results. Similarly, very deep and complex nets tend to overfit the training data more easily. So in short, it is true that deep, deep nets do work very well in many CNN tasks, but there are other factors that one needs to consider. I hope this peer review helps the author and the readers. --qianqian Peer Review I agree with the conclusion of the paper, but I have some concerns about the presentation of the content. First, the introduction is a little bit too long. I think the main idea is fine, but it can be divided into two parts: the motivation and the threat. Second, in the related work section, the comparison with pointwise nets is a little bit premature. The pointwise nets were proposed much later than the deep and deep nets and may not be as effective in some situations. I recommend to remove or modify the part about pointwise nets in the related work section. Third, the conclusion of the paper is a little bit over-interpretation. Yes, deep and deep nets do work very well on many CNN tasks, but there are other factors that one needs to consider. So in short, deep, deep nets do work very well in many cases, but there are other factors that one needs to consider. Overall, I like the idea of the paper and the content is good. But before I recommend the acceptance of the paper, the author needs to address the above concerns. -- qianqian -- I agree with the comments from Qianqian. I have made changes accordingly. -- NiLuJe Peer Review I agree with the comments from Qianqian. I have made changes accordingly. I have some concerns about the implementation. First, although the author has used the name ResNet for the first time in the paper, ResNet only uses 1x1 filters in the first layer. ResNeXt, a more recent architecture, actually uses 1x1, 3x3, and there dot-products of 3x3. It can be seen from the name that the idea of ResNet is not to use too many layers. In fact, compared with the mainstream VGG architecture, ResNet can dramatically reduce the number of layers and parameters while maintaining the same or even better performance. I recommend the author to have a more detailed comparison between ResNet and VGG. Second, the author chose the Letter Recognition task to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. I wonder whether the accuracy on the Letter Recognition task is high enough to measure the performance of text detection. -- NiLuJe -- I agree with the comments from Qianqian.

        "In this work, we present a systematic scan for 7-colourings of the grid, aiming to find all possible ways to colour a rectangular grid of size m×n using seven distinct colours. We use a divide-and-conquer approach, where we decompose the grid into smaller sub-grids and find all possible 7-colourings for each sub-grid, and then combine them to form a 7-colouring for the entire grid.\n\nThe motivation for this research lies in the need to understand the colouring properties of grids, which have applications in various fields such as graph theory, computer vision, and telecommunications. By presenting an exhaustive list of 7-colourings of the grid, we contribute to the development of methods for optimising grid colourings in these fields.\n\nOur results show that the number of 7-colourings of the grid increases rapidly as the size of the grid increases. For example, we found 8,065,328 distinct 7-colourings for a 4x4 grid, while for a 5x5 grid, we found 630,880,211 distinct 7-colourings. Furthermore, we observed that there exist symmetrical 7-colourings that are invariant under certain reflections, rotations, or translations.\n\nIn conclusion, our systematic scan for 7-colourings of the grid provides a comprehensive list of all possible ways to colour rectangular grids using seven colours and offers insights into the colouring properties of grids.",
        "Hinged doors first appeared during the late 12th century in Europe. Prior to this, doors were typically made from wood, which were not strong enough to be used on exterior walls, or to provide security. These doors needed to be secured by additional wooden or metal pieces, called hinges, that joined the doorframe to the door. The earliest known example of a metal hinge appears in a 1185 design by William of Sens, which was for a church door. This was followed by other European churches and cathedrals having doors with metal hinges in the 13th and 14th centuries. The first known reference to a double door with separated door panels appearing in a 1285 French charterhouse (almshouse) design by Simon de Pleine was for the main door. The first recorded instance of a triple door, with three door panels that could be separated, appears in a 14th century Italian townhall, also by Simon de Pleine. The first known reference to a windowscreen being used for a door appears in an English charterhouse in 1327. The first known reference to a bi-fold doors appearing in a 1395 Florentine made book of receipts. It was a door in a house in Venice. The first bi-fold door specifically designed for use as a door, with fixed panels, was in a 14th century English house in Merton, London, England. The first known reference to a sliding door appears in a 14th century Italian townhall. The first opening Coventry Cathedral had in 1485, which was a door featuring a hoist, a pulley system and rope winch to raise the doors weight. The first dual action hinges appearing in 1490 in a German town hall. Throughout the 16th century hinges improved, moving from a crude 'bar & screw' system to more sophisticated designs involving multiple springs, wheels, and other engineering solutions. By the late 16th century, English houses were starting to use iron hinges. In 1725, the first viable cast iron hinge appeared, leading to a boom in the use of doors with these new hinges. Hinges have continued to evolve, with advances in technology allowing for more refined designs that improve the functionality of doors, while maintaining a simple design that is easily manufactured. Today, doors can be made with a wide variety of options, including number of panels, materials, finishes, and features, that meet the needs of a wide range of users. Early doors were used to keep out wind and rain, while also providing a way to access the inner buildings. As technology has improved, doors have also been used to provide better security, to help prevent people and things from coming into the building, and to prevent things from getting out. Hinges were not the first way to join door panels and make doors, but",
        " Huo Qubing (died in the 4th century BC), courtesy name Yuxi, was a Chinese explorer, military leader, and politician. He was the first of the Qin dynasty (China's first dynasty) to explore and conquer the regions of the south, including the area of Vietnam. His expedition to the south is recorded as the first major territorial expansion of the Qin Empire, and it laid the foundation for the later colonies of the Qin and Han dynasties in Southeast Asia. Huo was a native of the ancient state of Chu, which was conquered by the Qin in the late 4th century BC. After his father, Huo Yi, served as the prime minister of the Qin for a short period in 382 BC, Huo Qubing was sent to the state of Zhao as a hostage to ensure the loyalty of the Zhao. After the death of the Zhao king, Huo was allowed to return to the Qin. He was made a cavalry commander and took part in the Qin campaigns against the states of Wei and Chu. In the early years of the reign of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, Huo was appointed as the governor of the important city of Xiqu, and later as the minister of justice. After a number of successful military campaigns in the south, he was made the viceroy of the region between the Yangtze and the Huai rivers, with the title of Marquis of Wu'an. In 299 BC, Huo was sent to the south to explore the region and to force the states of Chu, Zhao, and Yan to submit to the Qin. After a number of successful campaigns, he was given the title of king, and the regions he had conquered became the colony of the Qin Empire.

        " Nitration Nitration is the process of adding nitro groups to a molecule. The most common method is to treat a nucleophilic organic compound, such as aniline or cyclohexane, with nitric acid (HNO3). The attack of the nucleophile on the nitronium ion results in the addition of a nitro group to the organic molecule. Nitration can also be accomplished using other nitronium sources, such as nitromethane, nitroethane, and nitrous oxide. Because the nitronium ion is relatively weakly basic, its concentration in these mixtures is very low. The low concentration and the presence of other functional groups that may react with the nitronium ion makes the use of these nitronium sources difficult for nitration of complex organic molecules. The mechanism of nitration is based on the formation of a nitronium ion from nitric acid. The nitronium ion is a good leaving group and is able to replace the leaving group in the organic molecule. In the case of a nucleophilic organic compound, the leaving group is often a halide, such as chloride or bromide. The replacement of the leaving group by the nitronium ion results in the addition of the nitro group to the organic molecule. In the case of an electrophilic organic compound, the leaving group is often a carboxylate, such as acetate or propionate. The replacement of the leaving group by the nitronium ion results in the addition of the nitro group to the organic molecule. The addition of the nitro group to an organic molecule often results in a change in the properties of the molecule. In many cases, the nitro group increases the acidity of the molecule. This is because the nitro group is a strong acidic group. In addition, the nitro group can also change the reactivity of the molecule. In many cases, the nitro group can increase the electrophilic character of the molecule. This can make the molecule more reactive to electrophilic reagents, such as acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. The nitration of organic molecules is a common reaction in organic chemistry. It is used to make a variety of different organic molecules, including amino acids, explosives, and dyes.",

        "\nWe present a new algorithm for computing the magnetic field in a protoplanetary disk based on the magnetohydrodynamic equations. Our method does not require the introduction of any empirical model, such as the magnetic field amplification factor. We obtain a good agreement with the observations of the magnetic field in the solar nebula, as well as in the disks around other stars. The new algorithm is based on an adequate spatial sampling and the proper treatment of the divergence of the magnetic field, taking into account the azimuthal and radial variations of the field in the disk. In addition, we propose a new parameterization of the magnetic field in the disk, which allows a simple evaluation of the field in the plane of the disk. Our results show that the magnetic field is generated mainly in the upper part of the disk, with a minimum value in the midplane, in agreement with the observations. We also show that the field in the plane is mainly toroidal, with a contribution of about one order of magnitude higher than the poloidal component, in agreement with the predictions of the Parker instability theory. Finally, we discuss the problem of the formation of the magnetic field in the disk, and we analyze the physical properties of the magnetic grains that might be responsible for the generation of the field.",
        "\n\nWe consider the Lieb-Oxford bound on the energies of entangled states of massive particles. We show that this bound is tight for all possible entangled states of massive particles and therefore rules out a number of potential extensions of quantum mechanics that would relax this bound. This rules out, in particular, any version of hidden variables theory in which the bound is relaxed, unless the physical parameters of the theory are such that massive particles can be prepared in states that do not correspond to a well-defined position-momentum pair. We show that such states can be achieved in a version of hidden variables theory in which the position and momentum operators do not commute, provided that the bound is replaced by a weaker one that still holds for all states of massive particles. We show further that this still rules out a number of hidden variables theories that are usually considered to be candidates for a theory beyond quantum mechanics. We then consider a generalization of the Lieb-Oxford bound to a class of noncommutative probability spaces that includes as a special case the probability spaces of quantum mechanics. We show that this generalization of the bound is equivalent to the original one, in that it rules out any extension of quantum mechanics in which the bound is relaxed.",

We use a sample of 380,000 LRGs selected to have 0.4 < zphot < 1.0 and Mr < --21.5 + 5logh. The angular correlation function is measured for this sample using the Landy & Szalay estimator on scales between 10' and 100'. To account for redshift space distortions we measure the projected cross-correlation functions wp(rp), where rp = Dproj/[H(z)/H0], H(z) is the Hubble parameter at redshift z, and H0 is its value today. These measurements are made over a range of transverse separations corresponding to physical scales ranging from 2 h-1 Mpc to 20 h-1 Mpc. In addition, we also measure the real-space two-point correlation function by applying the method developed by Eisenstein et al. (2007) . This measurement is performed only out to a maximum separation of 60 h-1 Mpc due to the limited number density of our galaxy sample.",

        "Well, both Botswana and Namibia have achieved low levels of perceived corruption when compared to other African countries, and consequently their rates are similar to those of more developed countries like Spain, Italy and Poland. This success can be linked to several factors. First and foremost, both countries appear to have strong and effective governments. Botswana, for instance, has been a democratic state since its independence in 1966, and has gained numerous seats in international organizations such as the United Nations. Likewise, Namibia has enjoyed a stable political situation since it gained independence in 1990. \n\nThese governments have actively striven to create and maintain transparent, effective and accountable systems of governance. A large part of this has been their implementation of various anti-corruption reforms, aimed at enforcing the rule of law and promoting accountability. This includes well-established legal frameworks and sophisticated audit systems to detect and root out corruption. The governments of both countries have also strived to ensure openness and transparency in the areas of public tender processes and financial dealings. For example, Botswana has established a code of conduct for public officials, which requires them to act in a manner that is both ethical and above board.\n\nAdditionally, this success can be attributed in part to the cultural and historic factors of both countries. The citizens of both countries are strongly opposed to corruption and expect their governments to abide by the law and ensure that everyone is treated fairly. This has created an environment in which corruption is rarely tolerated by either the public or the government, leading to greater commitment to the enforcement of anti-corruption reform.\n\nFinally, the successful economies of both countries have also helped in keeping corruption at bay. Botswana and Namibia have seen strong economic growth in recent years, due in large part to the development of natural resources such as diamonds and copper, as well as foreign investment. This economic success has enabled their governments to provide its citizens with high standards of public services and infrastructure, mitigating any incentive or opportunity for corruption to take place. \n\nTo summarize, Botswana and Namibia have achieved far lower levels of perceived corruption than other African countries due to their strong and effective governments, their commitment to transparency and anti-corruption reforms, their culturally grounded stance against corruption, and the development of healthy economic conditions.",

        " Auxvasse Creek is a 71.8-mile-long creek in north-central Missouri in the United States. It runsthrough Audrain, Monroe and Montgomery counties. The source of the Auxvasse Creek is located in southeastern Audrain County, located in the north-central portion of Missouri. It then runs north-northwest passing through Montgomery County and then turning northwest following US Highway 54 passing by the community of Auxvasse in western Callaway County. In Lewistown the creek turns more northerly and passes Colesburg and eventually enters the Salt River northwest of Clark in northeast Montgomery County. The Main Fork of Auxvasse Creek passes through Audrain, Monroe and Montgomery counties and is a tributary of the Salt River near Clark. In total, three major branches of the Auxvasse Creek network supply watershed areas in north-central Missouri. The Auxvasse Creek watershed provides a natural platform for supporting many recreational activities which include fishing, hunting, canoeing, kayaking, swimming, camping and nature study. The area is also rich with bird life, playgrounds, and other outdoor recreational opportunities. The Auxvasse Creek area is an excellent location for a variety of forms of outdoor exploration and discovery year-round. Auxvasse Creek is the headwaters of many of the tributary streams, including Buttermilk Creek, Wolf Creek, Sinking Creek, and Commerce Creek. Buttermilk Creek, a tributary of Auxvasse Creek, is a 28-mile-long stream that connects with Wolf and Sinking Creeks in northern Montgomery County. Wolf Creek is a 9.3-mile-long stream that also runs through the Auxvasse Watershed. Other notable tributaries of Auxvasse Creek are McCoy Creek, Brush Creek, and Indian Creek. The Auxvasse Creek is the host of several fishing tournaments conducted annually in the area. Many different species of fish inhabit the creek, including catfish, bass, sunfish, carp and channel catfish, as well as other species. The Auxvasse Creek Watershed is home to many different species of plants and animals, offering a rich ecosystem vital to the health of its inhabitants and the surrounding areas. From a geological point of view, the Auxvasse Creek is a part of the northern Mississippi River Valley. Auxvasse Creek is part of the floodplain which, combined with the various tributaries, supplies the area with a natural resource for recreational activities as well as providing important ground for supporting ecosystems. In August 1984, Auxvasse Creek was declared a State Inland Waterway by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. This designation places Auxvasse Creek in a special category that allows certain industrial and water development activities to occur in the watershed under rigid guidelines and regulations. This provides an investment opportunity that increases the importance and value of this unique creek. The Auxvasse Creek and its tributaries are essential water resources in central Missouri. These watersheds provide an avenue for recreation, protect the environment, and offer businesses an opportunity to invest in the area. The Auxvasse Creek watershed is a valuable subject of study and consideration and should be protected, preserved and enjoyed.",
        "Parasites have been a constant human companion since prehistoric times and the Vikings were no exception. In fact, the Vikings likely faced an even greater risk of parasitic infection than most other ancient civilizations due to their lifestyle, which often involved unsanitary living conditions and close contact with animals.\n\nSo how did people deal with parasites in the olden days? The answer varies depending on the time period and geographical location, but there are a few common remedies that have been used throughout history. One of the most popular remedies was the use of herbs and plants, many of which are still used today to treat parasitic infections. For example, garlic and onion were often consumed in large quantities as they were believed to be effective against parasites. Other plants such as wormwood, black walnut, and clove were also commonly used to treat intestinal worms.\n\nIn addition to herbal remedies, people in the olden days would often try to prevent parasitic infections by practicing good hygiene. This meant regularly washing hands, clothes, and bedding, as well as avoiding contact with contaminated water and soil. In some cases, people would even use hygiene-related methods such as enemas or bloodletting to rid themselves of parasites.\n\nOf course, not all methods of dealing with parasites were effective. Many old-time remedies were based on superstition rather than science, and some were downright dangerous. For example, in medieval times it was common to use mercury, which is highly toxic, to treat parasitic infections.\n\nIn the end, dealing with parasites in the olden days was a mixed bag. While some remedies were effective, many were not, and people often had to suffer through parasitic infections without any relief. Fortunately, modern medicine has come a long way since then, and we now have a variety of safe and effective treatments for parasitic infections.",

We find that the majority of brightest cluster members are elliptical or lenticular galaxies, while only one galaxy is classified as an S0/a galaxy. The fraction of S0s increases towards fainter luminosities, reaching about 50% at M V = −18 mag. This result suggests that most S0s were formed through morphological transformation of late-type spirals during their infall into the cluster environment. In addition to this morphological transformation scenario, we also consider other possible mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping by intracluster gas and tidal interactions between galaxies. By comparing the observed number density profiles of globular clusters around different types of ETGs, we show that there exists no significant difference among these three populations.",
        "A Little Princess is a seven-part British miniseries produced by the BBC in 1973. The series is an adaptation of the classic children's novel of the same name by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The story follows the life of Sara Crewe, a young girl sent to a boarding school in London while her father goes off to fight in the Boer War. Sara is initially beloved by her schoolmates and the headmistress Miss Minchin, due to her wealth and kind heart. However, when news arrives that Sara's father has died and left her penniless, her status at the school changes drastically. Despite the hardships she faces, Sara remains positive and resilient, and even befriends a servant girl named Becky who is also mistreated by Miss Minchin. Sara's imagination and compassion help her overcome the challenges she faces and ultimately lead to her fortune being restored. The miniseries features a talented cast, including Maureen Lipman as Miss Minchin, Ruth Dunning as Sara, and Miriam Margolyes as Becky.

        "The authors proposed a framework to understand the language information captured by sentence representations based on fixed-length vectors. The proposed framework focuses on three aspects of sentence structure: sentence length, word content, and word order, and uses prediction tasks based on these aspects to score sentence representations. The authors analyzed different sentence embedding mechanisms and provided insights into the relative strengths of these methods with respect to the proposed low-level prediction tasks.\n\nThe paper is well-written and the findings are presented in a clear and concise manner. The proposed framework provides a useful method to evaluate the quality of sentence representations and better understand the properties that are encoded in these representations. The experiments carried out in the paper are thorough, and the results are insightful.\n\nOne potential weakness of the paper is that the authors only used a limited set of prediction tasks, which may not capture all aspects of sentence structure. Future work could explore additional prediction tasks that would allow for a more comprehensive analysis of sentence representations.\n\nOverall, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of NLP and provides a valuable framework that can be used to evaluate and compare sentence embedding methods. The findings should be of interest to both researchers and practitioners working in the field of NLP.",
        "LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide) is a powerful hallucinogenic drug that alters the user’s perception, thinking, and emotion. It is naturally derived from ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and other grains and is also produced in a laboratory environment.\n\nUpon ingestion, LSD is quickly absorbed into and circulates throughout the bloodstream. It then enters into the central nervous system, where it binds to serotonin receptors in the brain. This connection changes the way users view the world around them because serotonin is a neurotransmitter responsible for regulating numerous aspects of behavior and cognition, including mood, anxiety, and perception.\n\nEffects can be felt as early as 30 minutes after ingestion, and peaks at 1-2 hours after, depending on the dose taken. There is a surge in creativity, time distortion, and uplifting mood as a result of the chemical reaction between the drug and the brain.\n\nAdditionally, LSD has been studied for its potential therapeutic benefits. While individuals can experience visual and auditory hallucinations, they often report feeling clear-minded and highly functional while under the influence. During this period of heightened clarity and awareness, users are often able to make connection with their own thought patterns and behaviors.\n\nAt higher doses, users might experience more dramatic effects such as synesthesia (senses blending together), depersonalization, and “lowered” cognitive functioning. These dissociative-like effects are more strongly associated with a “bad trip” and can lead to anxiety, confusion, and paranoia.\n\nThe effects of an LSD experience are temporary, usually lasting 8 -10 hours. As users come down from the trip, they often report feeling relaxed, introspective, and content. The intensity of the experience can vary greatly from person to person, and is greatly influenced by the user’s mindset and environment when taking the drug. \n\nAll in all, LSD can have both positive and negative effects on the user. Common side effects include elevated heart rate, increased body temperature, dry mouth, nausea, and increased blood pressure. As with any drug, it is important for individuals to be mindful of their safety and to use it responsibly.",
        "Write a long abstract of a scientific paper from arXiv.org. Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Dark Matter in Gauge Mediation from Emergent Supersymmetry\".\nAbstract:\nWe propose that the dark matter (DM) and supersymmetric particles are generated by an emergent gauge symmetry at high energy scales, which is broken down to Standard Model symmetries below TeV scale. The DM candidate can be identified as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with spontaneous breaking of global U(1) symmetry. We show how this scenario can explain various experimental results on DM searches including recent LHC data. In addition we discuss possible collider signatures for future experiments such as ILC or CLIC. Introduction: Dark matter (DM), whose existence has been inferred through its gravitational effects over many decades [1] , remains one of the most mysterious phenomena in particle physics today [2] . Although there have been numerous proposals for explaining the origin of DM [3] , none of them has yet provided compelling evidence for their viability [4] .\nIn this work, motivated by the idea of \"emergent\" theories [5] - [8] , we consider a new possibility where DM emerges from a spontaneously-broken global symmetry [9] . This approach provides a simple explanation for why DM should exist without introducing any additional fields beyond those already present within the Standard Model [10] . Furthermore, it allows us to identify the DM candidate as a pseudo-NambuGoldstone boson [11] , thereby providing a natural solution to the so-called \"WIMP miracle\" [12] problem [13] . Finally, our model also predicts the presence of light scalar superpartners [14] , which may provide interesting signals at upcoming high-energy accelerator facilities [15] .\nThe rest of this article is organised as follows. In Sec. 2, we introduce our theoretical framework based upon emergent gauge mediation [16] . Then, in Secs. 3-7, we demonstrate how this framework can simultaneously address all current experimental constraints [17] - [20] while predicting novel phenomenological features [21] . Finally, in Sec. 8, we conclude with some remarks about further directions of research.",

Variance in these equations due to factors such as dust attenuation, the inclusion of lenticular galaxies and the same (Y|X) regressional analysis are appraised. Adjustments made, ultimately produce a relation that yields consistent black hole masses. Analysis of K, B and R-bands yields corresponding M_bh-L relations. Discussion of the implications for dry mergers, intermediate mass black holes and a potential sample selection bias follow. An expression for correction is provided in order to rectify the bias.",

        "Real medieval cities did have guards, though not exactly as portrayed in video games and fantasy fiction. During medieval times, cities had walls around them and guards to control who entered and left. These city walls were not always made of stone, and sometimes were made of wood. The guards would usually stand in towers and watch over the walls.\n\nIn some cities, the guards were armed with spears, swords, clubs, or other weapons. Sometimes they wore armor, while other times they wore only simple clothing. Depending on the city, the guards might keep watch all of the time, or be assigned specific times each day.\n\nIn addition to city walls and guards, most cities in medieval times also had walls surrounding their gates. These gates were typically guarded around the clock by one or more full-time guards to keep unwanted visitors and trespassers out. Cities also often had city gates that could be locked overnight or during times of trouble.\n\nOverall, medieval cities did have guards, though the guards didn't look the same or do the same types of things that you might see in video games or fantasy fiction. The guards were responsible for keeping people and things out of the city, rather than adventures and such.",
        "During the Medieval period, identifying which side a soldier was on was a crucial task in the battlefield, given the chaotic nature of warfare. Several methods were employed by Medieval armies to distinguish between their own soldiers and the enemies, including the use of uniforms, flags, banners, insignias, and symbols. Additionally, soldiers might wear identifying marks or accessories, such as badges, colors, or crests, indicating their allegiance to a particular lord, commander, or army. Sometimes, soldiers would shout slogans or battle cries to show their loyalty or challenge the enemy.\n\nHowever, these identifying methods were not always successful, and soldiers could still be misidentified, especially in the fog of war, or when the opposing army employed similar tactics or clothing. The risk of friendly fire and mistaken identity was evident in many battles throughout the Medieval period. For instance, during the Battle of Agincourt, on October 25, 1415, English soldiers slaughtered several French prisoners who were dressed like the English, leading to a notorious act of violence and confusion.\n\nThe likelihood of friendly fire also depended on factors such as the size of the army, the complexity of battle formations, and the level of discipline and training of the soldiers. In smaller armies, soldiers might know each other personally, reducing the chances of misidentifications. In contrast, in larger armies, soldiers might be less familiar with their comrades, leading to higher risks of confusion.\n\nOverall, while Medieval armies employed various methods to distinguish friend from foe, the risk of friendly fire and mistaken identity remained high, leading to casualties and confusion in many battles. Despite the limitations of these methods, soldiers were trained to focus on their objectives and follow commands, even in the heat of battle, to minimize the risks of misidentifications and maximize their chances of victory.",
        "\n\nWhen it comes to cleaning effectiveness, there is a clear difference between a regular manual toothbrush and an electric one. Research has shown that electric toothbrushes are more effective at removing plaque, which is a sticky film of bacteria that builds up on teeth. Plaque is a major cause of tooth decay and gum disease, so using an electric toothbrush can help to reduce the risk of these problems.\n\nElectric toothbrushes also tend to be more effective at cleaning the hard-to-reach areas of the mouth, such as the back teeth and the gum line. This is because they have a rotating or oscillating head that helps to loosen plaque and debris from the teeth.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all electric toothbrushes are created equal. Some models are better than others at removing plaque, and some may be too aggressive for certain people, such as those with sensitive teeth or gum recession.\n\nIt is also important to remember that brushing technique and frequency are still important factors in maintaining good oral hygiene. No matter what type of toothbrush you use, it is important to brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day, using a soft-bristled brush and fluoride toothpaste.",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"BEC-BCS Crossover of a Trapped Two-Component Fermi Gas with Unequal Masses\".\nAbstract:\nWe study the crossover between Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluidity in an ultracold trapped two-component fermionic gas with unequal masses by using the mean-field theory based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. We find that, for equal interaction strengths, the condensate fraction is larger than that of the single component case when one mass is much lighter than the other; while it becomes smaller if both masses are comparable to each other.  The critical temperature T_c decreases as the difference between the masses increases. For large enough mass ratio, we observe a first-order phase transition at low temperatures instead of second order. In addition, we show that there exists a tricritical point where the phase transition changes from second-to-first order. Finally, we calculate the density profiles of the system under different conditions numerically. \nI. INTRODUCTIO N\nUltracold atomic gases have been widely used to simulate many-body quantum systems [1] . Recently, great progress has been made in studying strongly correlated fermions [2] , especially those with spin degrees of freedom [3] .\nIn particular, the recent experimental realization of BoseEinstein condensation (BEC), i.e., macroscopic occupation of the lowest energy state [4] , in a dilute gas of bosonic atoms opens up new possibilities to explore novel phenomena such as Cooper pairing [5] or supersolidity [6] in fermion systems [7, 8] . It also provides us with a unique opportunity to investigate the interplay between these two kinds of quantum phases [9] . On the theoretical side, this problem can be studied within the framework of the so-called Bose-Fermi mixture model [10] which describes a mixture of interacting bosons and noninteracting fermions [11] . This approach was originally developed to describe nuclear matter [12] but later found applications in various fields including cold atom physics [13] . However, most previous studies were focused on the cases where all particles have identical masses [14] . In real experiments, however, the masses of the constituent particles may not always be exactly the same [15] . Therefore",
        "\nWe consider a simple model of bacterial growth in which the local population density depends linearly on the local nutrient concentration, and the nutrient diffusion is described by the Keller-Segel equation. We find that the population density has a critical value, below which the population dies out, and above which the population continues to grow. This critical density has a simple expression in terms of the coefficients of the Keller-Segel equation. We show that this critical density has an analogy in the theory of white dwarf stars. In particular, the limiting mass of a white dwarf, below which the star collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, has the same form as the critical density of the bacterial population. We also consider a more general model in which the local population density depends on the local nutrient concentration in a more complicated way. In this case, the critical density has a more involved form, but still has an analogy with the limiting mass of white dwarf stars.",

The NIR polarization vectors are aligned with those in optical images, indicating that they trace scattered light from an illuminating source located behind the dense molecular cloud core. We find evidence for two distinct scattering regions along our line-of-sight to this object; one is associated with the brightest part of the nebula, while another region shows lower polarization degrees but higher polarized fluxes at longer wavelengths. These results suggest that there may be multiple sources contributing to the observed emission. In addition, we detect several absorption features which can be attributed to water ice on dust grains near the central star(s). Our observations also reveal a possible outflow cavity traced by blueshifted CO emission lines.

        "The A* CCG parser is a state-of-the-art parser for achieving robust semantic parsing on a large corpus of natural language text. It can be used for downstream applications such as machine translation, question answering, and summarization. In this paper, the authors present a technique for efficiently implementing the A* algorithm on top of a dependency factored model. They demonstrate that the algorithm achieves comparable performance to the state of the art on standard benchmark datasets. This is a novel and very interesting contribution, however it lacks some technical detail regarding specific algorithmic techniques. Most importantly, this is not an algorithm for a natural language processing task, but rather a model for efficiently applying the A* algorithm to a semantic parsing task. Henceforth the paper would be stronger if it could describe how the dependency factored model differs from other approaches to semantic parsing and why it makes the A* algorithm applicable. For example, it would be nice to know whether there are other approaches to parsing that can also be factored in this way, and whether it is necessary to do so in order to apply the A* algorithm. The introduction could also do a better job of setting the scene and explaining the problem statement. tirespitorywould be stronger if it could describe how the dependency factored model differs from other approaches to semantic parsing and why it makes the A* algorithm applicable.

        "Cosmic rays interact with gas to produce a range of chemical products. In this work we show that this process also modifies the elemental composition of the gas. We apply our model to the gas observed in the prsent day universe and show that, although the Xelement enhancement is typically much lower than in high-z systems, it is able to reproduce the general trend. Finally we show that the evolution of the enhancement depends strongly on the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum at low energy. We apply our model to a broad range of spectra and show that different spectra lead to Xelement enhancements at the level of $10^{-3} - 1$ solar values at $z = 0$ for different metallicities at $10^{-4}$ solar values. This wide range of possible enhancements highlights the importance of experimental studies of the early evolution of the Universe. We describe an effect whereby the interactions between cosmic rays and the primordial gas influence both the gas phase and the element abundances. This has important implications for the potentiality of the gas to form structures and for the evolution of the heavy element abundance with time. We apply our model to the gas observed in the present-day Universe and show that although the general trend of the Xelement enhancement is lower than in high-redshift systems, it is still sufficient to reproduce the general trend. We also show that the evolution of the enhancement strongly depends on the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum at low energy. Our work highlights the importance of experimental studies of the early evolution of the Universe and the need to obtain a better understanding of processes occurring at low energies, such as the interaction between cosmic rays and the gas in the early universe. We provide a formalism for computing the evolution of the chemical abundances, including the element abundance enhancement, starting from a given ionisation and chemical networks and a given spectrum of cosmic rays. The results of the calculations are self-consistent as they can be fed back into the ionisation and chemical networks. The new networks have to be specified in terms of the twelve essential reactions needed to generate the sixteen molecules containing a significant fraction of the enhanced elements and a full network for eleven further elements (B, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, Re, Ru, Os, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, and Po). The updated chemical composition can strongly impact the cooling/heating rates of the gas, the star formation, and the gravitational collapse and further enrichment of the gas. The effects described in this work are not restricted to the epoch of reionization but extend to any time in the history of the gas, until the gas is removed from the simulation by some feedback mechanism.

        "The paper TextFlow: A Text Similarity Measure based on Continuous Sequences introduces a new method for measuring the similarity of two texts. The text similarity score is based on the hypothesis that words occurring in the same context within a long text carry similar semantic meanings. The approach used by the paper for determining the similarity is simple and effective. It does, however, lack certain degrees of freedom which may allow the measure to be further improved. The measure's precision appears to be highly dependent on the length of the short text being compared to. For example, if the short text is only a few words long, then the similarity score will tend to reflect the length of the short text rather than the similarity of its content. Another possible improvement could be a more rigorous treatment of homographs and acronyms. meg Improved stability and some additional robustness to length normalization could be added to the measure. For example, to deal with the issue of short texts sometimes giving a high similarity score even though they are very short, the measure could be normalized by the number of words in the shortest text. Homographs and acronyms could be handled by either excluding them from the similarity score or adding a smoothing of some sort to deal with episodes of numerous occurrences of the same word. maaz Use of textFlow concept The approach used by the paper for determining the similarity is simple and effective.

        "The Watergate scandal was a major political scandal that occurred in the United States in the early 1970s, after a group of burglars broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. The scandal resulted in the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the conviction of several of his aides. In Germany, the Watergate controversy is perhaps best known as an American political scandal, though its effects were global, reaching even the German government.\n\nTo put it simply, the Watergate scandal began when a group of five men broke into the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. on June 17, 1972. The men burglarized the offices, photographed documents, and planted listening devices to gather information on the Democratic campaign. They were arrested by the US police, and the scandal quickly became the focus of intense media attention and an official investigation.\n\nThe ultimate scandal was caused by the efforts of the Nixon administration to cover up the crime by lying and using interference tactics to impede the investigation. This included using the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to interfere with the FBI's efforts to investigate, using false identities to funnel money to the burglars, and deleting relevant materials from official White House recordings. Eventually, the Washington Post and other media outlets uncovered the truth, linking the burglary to President Nixon and his team of White House advisers.\n\nThe Watergate scandal was particularly significant in the United States because it highlighted the nature of power and corruption in the US political system. It underscored the need for a stronger system of checks and balances on the executive branch, as well as greater public scrutiny of government activities. In Germany, it raised awareness of foreign corruption in politics and brought into question the reliability of international relations, forcing Germans to take more seriously the dangers of conspiracy and power abuse.\n\nIt was a major international scandal, not only because of the US administration’s involvement, but because the US remains one of the world's leading superpowers, and thus the scandal could have had a far-ranging impact, including economic and political disruption. Moreover, the Watergate scandal put a spotlight on the press and its role in democracy, causing people across the world to reconsider the value of a free and open press as a necessary part of democracy. Thus, the Watergate scandal was significant, not only because of its immediate implications for the US and the face of international relations, but also for the lasting impact it had",

        "H.P. Lovecraft was notoriously racist. Many of his short stories explore the subjugation of various races or outsiders via scientific experimentation. Specifically, he was known for his skepticism of androids and human/alien hybrids. Lovecraft coined the term \"cosmic horror\" to describe the terror one would feel confronted with the unknown or unexplained. In this sense, he was not dissimilar from many other authors of his era. However, unlike many of his contemporaries, Lovecraft's racism went far beyond mere scientific skepticism. He embraced white supremacy and diatribes such as \"fixedness of race\" were commonplace in his writing. It is for this reason that he is widely considered one of the most racist authors in American history. Audio version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8yWLCXf48g Herbert West – Reanimator",

        "Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a zinc metalloprotease shown to be responsible for the progression of many types of cancer through the degradation of insulin, insulin-like growth factors and other growth factors. In the current study, several human tissue types were evaluated for the expression of IDE, and many previously reported findings were confirmed. The strongest IDE staining was seen in breast, prostate, liver and pancreas tissue. Surprisingly, some previously reported IDE-positive normal human tissue types (including: brain, eye, kidney and small intestine) were demonstrated to be negative for IDE, and in a few instances, the opposite was true (i.e. some IDE-negative normal human tissue types were shown to be positive for IDE). These findings raise doubts about the validity of many previous studies examining the expression of IDE in normal and neoplastic human tissue. *Citation: Jaggo N, Jalkanmaa M, Mannisto P, Saloheimo J (2018) Immunohistochemical pitfalls in the demonstration of insulin-degrading enzyme in normal and neoplastic human tissues.

        "Neutron stars are born with a hydrogen-rich envelope that is dynamically stripped away by the accretion of matter from a binary companion. Observations indicate that this matter is mixed into the neutron star surface layers, but the distribution of elements and the underlying physical process are not well understood. We combine the rapid rotation and strong gravitational field of neutron stars with magnetohydrodynamics simulations to study turbulent mixing in the surface layers. We find that the Coriolis force acting on the convective eddies accelerates the star toward the inner part of the companion's Roche lobe, facilitating tidal interaction and driving strong turbulence. The turbulent viscosity and electron conduction allow the elements to spread several pressure scale heights into the neutron star atmosphere. The turbulent diffusion coefficient is within an order of magnitude of the viscosity coefficient, suggesting that this process may be crucial for establishing the observed composition gradients.<|endoftext|>// Written by Jonathan Yates in 2016. // File: crypto_pam.h #ifndef CRYPTO_PAM_H #define CRYPTO_PAM_H #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> #include \"pam_mat.h\" /** * PAM module for encrypting data using AES in counter mode */ typedef struct crypto_pam_state { pam_mat_t mat; /** * Keys for encryption */ unsigned char key[16]; /** * Current position in the IV */ unsigned char iv[16]; /** * Data to be encrypted */ unsigned char plaintext[65536]; } crypto_pam_state; /** * AES counter mode algorithm * * This is the PAM algorithm for encrypting data.

        "In this work, we present a comparison between a hierarchical galaxy formation model and SPITZER data to investigate galaxy evolution in the infrared. This study aims to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe, which is a significant and challenging problem in astrophysics. Our research is motivated by the fact that the infrared spectra of galaxies provide crucial information on the star formation rate, dust content, and chemical enrichment, which are key factors determining their evolution over time.\n\nThe hierarchical galaxy formation model is constructed based on the merger history of dark matter halos, which are assumed to host galaxies. We use this model to simulate the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe, incorporating the effects of gas dynamics, star formation, and feedback from supernovae and black hole accretion. We then compare the simulated galaxy properties with observations from the infrared data obtained by SPITZER.\n\nOur preliminary results show that the hierarchical galaxy formation model can reproduce the observed correlation between the star formation rate and dust content in galaxies as revealed by SPITZER. However, the model overpredicts the number of high-mass galaxies at high redshifts, indicating a limitation of the model assumptions. This study provides important insights into the physical processes governing galaxy evolution and highlights the need for more sophisticated models that can capture the complexity of the astrophysical phenomena involved.",

        "\nThis article examines the question of why advanced electromagnetic potentials have typically been viewed as anomalous and forcibly omitted from classical Maxwell theory. We evaluate if this exclusion is necessary and, in some cases, potentially counter-productive. We then analyze direct-action theory wherein advanced and retracted contributions are equal; allowing us to explain observed symmetry breaks without relying on the Wheeler-Feynman mechanism. Moreover, we propose that cosmological redshift automatically satisfies the necessary boundary condition for the theory, thus uniting cosmological and thermodynamic arrows of time. Our research thus hints that advanced potentials may be ubiquitous after all.",
        "\nWe explore the implications of supersymmetry-breaking in models where it is present at a lower intermediate scale compared to the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) level. We assume that the parameters of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model are unified at the M_{in} scale and look at the effects of this on the (m_{1/2},m_0) plane for two different values of tan(beta)=10 and tan(beta)=50. We also identify cases where the gaugino and scalar masses are uniform under the GUT scale, which are situations in mirage-mediation models. We demand that the Lightest Neutralino (LSP) be the relic neutralino density and ensure that the measurements from WMAP and other instruments do not conflict with this. For reasonable values of M_{in}, we find that the constraints on the (m_{1/2},m_0) plane are tight, but that the relic density is not terribly restrictive. At very low M_{in}, the electroweak vacuum conditions are the main limitation, and a secondary source of cosmological cold dark matter would be required for a large range of soft SUSY-breaking parameters and tan(beta) to explain the observed relic density. We compute the neutralinos-nucleon cross sections for feasible models and compare them with current and projected limits from dark matter searches.",

        "Well, that's a great question! The answer is not as simple as a yes or no. You see, measles is a highly contagious disease that can be spread through the air by coughing, sneezing, or even talking. So, while yes, those who are not vaccinated are at a higher risk of contracting the disease, they are not the only ones who can be affected. \n\nMeasles can be dangerous for anyone who contracts it, even for those who have previously been vaccinated. In fact, one dose of the measles vaccine is only about 93% effective at preventing the disease. This means that even those who have received the vaccine can still get sick. However, the vaccine does provide protection against severe symptoms and can prevent complications such as pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death. \n\nFurthermore, not everyone can be vaccinated, such as infants under six months of age, immunocompromised individuals, and those with certain medical conditions. These individuals are at an even greater risk of contracting the disease if those around them are not vaccinated. \n\nTherefore, it is not just those who choose not to vaccinate themselves or their children who are at risk, but also those around them. The best way to protect oneself and others is by getting vaccinated and encouraging others to do the same. It is our duty to keep ourselves and our community safe from preventable diseases like measles.",
        "In our research, we investigate the Exact Floquet States (EFS) of a driven condensate in an optical lattice. Our motivation is to study the properties of out-of-equilibrium quantum systems driven by an external periodic force. We aim to provide a new approach to understanding the stability of EFS, which are states in the driven system that preserve the periodicity of the driving force. These states can play a crucial role in the dynamics of the system and provide a useful tool for studying quantum systems out of equilibrium.\n\nThe key idea of our approach is to use a Floquet-Magnus expansion to calculate the stability properties of the EFS. We then use a variational method to approximate the EFS solutions in the strong driving regime. Our methodology combines analytical and numerical methods to obtain solutions for the unstable EFS.\n\nOur research attempts to solve the problem of the stability of EFS, which is a crucial issue in the study of quantum systems driven by external forces. Our results reveal the existence of unstable EFS and provide a new approach for studying the dynamics of driven quantum systems beyond linear response theory. The insights gained from our research can potentially guide the design of experiments on driven condensates and pave the way for developing new applications in quantum information processing and quantum simulation.",
        "In this study, we investigate the relationship between diffuse optical light (DOL) and galaxy cluster properties. The presence of DOL in galaxy clusters has long been known, but its origin and relation to the cluster properties remain unclear. Thus, our research aims to understand this phenomenon and its implications on our understanding of galaxy clusters.\n\nOur motivation for this research stems from the need to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters. DOL has been suggested to be the result of tidal interaction between the cluster's member galaxies, but recent studies suggest that it may also be linked to the cluster's dynamical state and history. By exploring the correlation between DOL and cluster properties, we hope to gain insights into the nature of these systems and their evolution over time.\n\nTo achieve our goal, we analyze DOL measurements and cluster properties from a sample of 36 galaxy clusters, obtained through the MUSE-Wide survey. We find a significant correlation between DOL luminosity and cluster properties such as temperature, X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. This correlation supports the idea that DOL is linked to the cluster's dynamical state, particularly the presence of substructures.\n\nOur results shed light on the role of DOL in galaxy clusters and provide further evidence for the complex nature of these systems. Future studies should aim to expand on these findings and explore the possibility of using DOL as a tool for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters.",
        "\nWe consider the gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric plasmas in Einstein-Maxwell spacetimes. We obtain exact solutions for a generic class of spherically symmetric plasmas which includes perfect fluids, and find that these solutions are stable against a gradual transformation of the plasma to a black hole. We also find that the solutions are stable against a sudden (adiabatic) compression of the plasma. However, this stability is achieved by a slow-down of the collapse in a finite range of radii. Therefore, a finite region of the plasma has a volume expansion which is balanced by a surface tension. We show that this region of slow-down can be made arbitrarily small by a proper choice of the fluid parameters, and thus the region of slow-down has a typical size of order 1 Planck length. Therefore, for generic spherically symmetric plasmas the Einstein-Maxwell theory leads to black holes with a surface tension. We discuss possible physical realizations of this surface tension, and show that the surface tension can be related to the tension in a solid shell which is surrounding the black hole.",

The general solution is obtained by solving the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation using path integral techniques. We show that this approach leads to exact results which are valid even when the system-environment coupling strength becomes large compared to the temperature. In particular we consider two examples where our formalism can be applied straightforwardly. First, we study QBM in a harmonic oscillator potential under the influence of white noise. Second, we investigate the effect of a time-dependent force on QBM. Finally, we discuss how our method could also be used to treat more complicated situations such as systems coupled to multiple environments or driven by colored noise.

It has been studied extensively over many years both theoretically [2] , experimentally [3] , and numerically [4] .\nIn recent years there have been several attempts to solve the master equation governing QBM exactly [5, 6, 7, 8] . However these approaches either require approximations [7, 9] or do not allow one to include external forces [6, 5] . Here we present a new technique based on Feynman-Kac path integrals [10] which allows us to obtain exact solutions for the master equation without any approximation [11] .

        "We present a direct measurement of the spatial curvature of our universe combining the information from distant supernovae Ia with the local gravity environment of the Sloan Great Wall galaxy cluster. The combined data set yields a value for curvature of −0.006 ± 0.008 (1σ), corresponding to a flat universe with 96% confidence. This measurement is consistent with a curvature of 0, as expected for a universe described by general relativity with a cosmological constant. However, we also find a significant statistical correction to the measured value of the cosmological constant of ΔΛ = −0.054 ± 0.032 (1σ), corresponding to an open universe with 99.99994% confidence. This correction, which we find to be consistent with statistical fluctuations expected from measurement uncertainties, provides a robust determination of the universe's spatial curvature. The spatial curvature of our universe has significant implications for the laws of gravity. The spatial curvature is proportional to the density of matter and hence a detection of curvature rules out large-scale matter distributions required to explain the observed acceleration. We suggest that this detection, in conjunction with previous observations of an accelerating universe from supernovae and the cosmic microwave background, necessitates the introduction of novel forms of energy with negative equations of state, such as dark energy.",

We find that quasars which form close pairs tend to follow the rich density profiles of globular clusters in these types of galaxies, with slopes of -1.5 and -2.4 respectively. This implies a mutual relationship between quasars and galaxies, in which the lensing effects of globular clusters are likely key to their proximity.",

For such data it is natural to consider a model with matching computational structure. In this work, we introduce a variational autoencoder-based generative model for tree-structured data. We evaluate our model on a synthetic dataset, and a dataset with applications to automated theorem proving. By learning a latent representation over trees, our model can achieve similar test log likelihood to a standard autoregressive decoder, but with the number of sequentially dependent computations proportional to the depth of the tree instead of the number of nodes in the tree.

        "Title: Dynamic Neural Turing Machine with Continuous and Discrete Addressing Schemes\n\nAuthors: John Smith, Jane Doe\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Dynamic Neural Turing Machine (DNTM) is a type of artificial neural network that is designed to solve sequential decision-making problems. In this paper, we propose a DNTM with both continuous and discrete addressing schemes. The continuous addressing scheme allows for efficient gradient-based optimization, while the discrete addressing scheme allows for more complex computations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on several benchmark tasks.\n\nReview:\n\nThe Dynamic Neural Turing Machine with Continuous and Discrete Addressing Schemes is an interesting and innovative model that proposes a novel machine learning approach for sequential decision-making problems. The authors present an extension of the DNTM architecture that includes both continuous and discrete addressing schemes.\n\nThe paper is well-structured and the theoretical foundations of the proposed model are sound. The authors clearly explain the advantages of including both continuous and discrete addressing schemes in their model and provide theoretical insights into how these schemes can enhance the model's performance.\n\nThe experimental results are also impressive and show that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models on several benchmark tasks. The authors provide detailed analyses of their results and discuss the strengths and limitations of their approach.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas that could be improved in the paper. Firstly, the authors could provide more information on the practical applications of their model in real-world scenarios. Secondly, more attention could be given to the limitations of the proposed model, especially in terms of its scalability to larger problem spaces. Finally, the language of the manuscript could be improved to make it more accessible to readers without background in the field.\n\nOverall, the paper is a valuable addition to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The authors present a clear and innovative approach to solving sequential decision-making problems and demonstrate the effectiveness of their model through rigorous experimentation. Therefore, I recommend acceptance of this paper subject to minor revisions.",
        "Electronics are complicated machines, so it's hard to explain why they just die. But, I guess it could happen for a few reasons.\n\nSometimes, it might be because of a single fault like a broken wire or a solder joint that gets loose. Maybe the electricity doesn't actually reach the parts of the machine anymore, so they just stop working.\n\nSometimes, if the electronic has been around for a long time, it might just wear out or break down over a long period. The parts inside might work too hard and wear out, or things corrode so they can't work properly anymore.\n\nThe other thing could be if lots of electricity or heat builds up inside the electronic. This heat can damage lots of the parts and stop them from working. Or overheating can't destroy any of the parts, but it can weaken them, so the machine will stop working anyway. \n\nAnd, if you don't take care of your electronics, it could stop working too. Dust and dirt can get into the machine and damage the parts, so it fails and stops working. \n\nThe main thing is to keep your electronics clean, and not to overuse them. If you take care of them, and make sure they can get enough air, then they should last a lot longer. \nAnd finally, maybe it's just out of luck, and the electronic has a fault from when it was built. If that's the case, it's nobody's fault, but that's why it's important to have a warranty on any electronics you buy.",
        "\n\nHow to Make Ribbon Leis\n\nA ribbon lei is a popular Hawaiian accessory. Whether you're getting married on the beach or just attending a Luau party, you'll want to make a few of these to wear. They also make great gifts for someone special. Making your own ribbon lei is fairly simple, so read on to learn how. \n\nChoose your colors\nThe first step is to decide what color you want your lei to be. Most people opt for a two-color combination. You can go with a classic black and white, or choose a more colorful option, like hot pink and light pink. Once you've picked out your colors, you'll need to get the rest of the supplies. \n\nGet your supplies\nYou'll need about a yard of each color of satin ribbon. You'll also need a hot glue gun, a couple of flowers, and some leaves. In a pinch, you can also use artificial flowers and leaves. Just make sure they look fresh.\n\nPlan your design\nThe next step is to plan out your design. You'll want to decide on the shape of your lei, as well as the colors you want to use. Once you have your design planned out, you can start cutting your ribbon.\n\nCut your ribbon\nYou'll need to cut your ribbon into equal pieces. This will make it easier to weave them together. You should have at least 36 inches of ribbon for each piece. Once you have all your pieces cut, you can start weaving them together.\n\nWeave your ribbon\nTo weave your ribbon, you'll need to start with one color and then add the other color. Make sure the pieces are alternating, and that there are no gaps between them. Once you have your ribbon woven, you can start gluing the ends together.\n\nGlue the ends together\nUse your hot glue gun to glue the ends of your ribbon together. Make sure the glue is strong enough to hold the ribbon in place. You may need to add a few extra dots of glue to make sure it's secure. Once you have the ends glued together, you can start adding your flowers and leaves.\n\nAdd your flowers and leaves\nTo add your flowers and leaves, you'll need to use your hot glue gun again. Just put a few dots of glue on the back of your flowers and leaves, and then press them into place on your lei. Make sure they're evenly spaced, and that they look nice and neat.",
        "\nWe present here results of a reinvestigation of the $e^+ e^-\\to K^+ K^- \\pi^+\\pi^-$, $K^+ K^- \\pi^0\\pi^0$ and $K^+ K^-\n  K^+ K^-$ cross sections, based on new data taken with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II $e^+ e^-$ accelerator. The analysis is based on the method of initial-state radiation, which allows a precise determination of the cross sections and a sensitive measurement of the energy distribution in the final state. We find good agreement with our previous analysis based on the $e^+ e^-\\to K^+ K^- \\pi^0\\pi^0$ cross section, but disagree with the previous $e^+ e^-\\to K^+ K^- \\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $e^+ e^-\\to K^+ K^- K^+ K^-$ cross sections. We show that this disagreement can be understood by an unexpectedly large non-linearity in the cross section, which affects the $e^+ e^-\\to K^+ K^- K^+ K^-$ cross section more than the $e^+ e^-\\to K^+ K^- \\pi^+\\pi^-$ cross section. We also present a model for the non-linearity which has no free parameters and is consistent with the data. \n\nWe also present a detailed study of the $e^+ e^-\\to K^+ K^- K^+ K^-$ cross section as a function of the invariant mass $m_{\\pi}$ of the final-state pions. We show that this cross section is very well described by a sum of three parts, corresponding to the $e^+ e^-\\to K^+ K^- K^+ K^-$, $e^+ e^-\\to K^+ K^- \\pi^+\\pi^-$, and $e^+ e^-\\to K^+ K^- \\pi^0\\pi^0$ cross sections. We show that this description is exact if we take the non-linearity into account. We then fit the data to a sum of three exponential functions, and show that the result is consistent with a large non-linearity and a small contribution from initial-state radiation.",

We find that LPT-based initial conditions produce spurious large-scale power at late times, which is not suppressed by increasing the number of particles used to generate these initial conditions. This effect can be mitigated by applying a low-pass filter to the evolved density field prior to generating new initial conditions with higher-order LPT. However, this approach does not completely remove all unwanted effects associated with the use of LPT-generated initial conditions. In addition, we show how the choice of time step used to evolve the initial conditions affects their accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct accurate initial conditions for large-volume cosmological simulations without having to resort to expensive high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.

        "\n\nWe show that an adjoint conjecture on differential operators with constant coefficients, due to Baker and Campbell, is in fact a vanishing conjecture. The motivation for this work is that vanishing conjectures are potentially more accessible to rigorous proofs than non-triviality conjectures. \n\nThe key ideas and methodology are as follows. We show that an integral equation which is related to the Baker-Campbell conjecture has an asymptotic form which is equivalent to the adjoint conjecture. The Baker-Campbell conjecture is a statement about the number of non-zero terms in a certain infinite sequence. The term in the sequence which is equal to the largest derivative is proportional to the coefficient of the highest derivative term in the integral equation. The fact that the integral equation has an asymptotic form which is equivalent to the adjoint conjecture allows us to deduce that the Baker-Campbell conjecture is a vanishing conjecture.\n\nThe results obtained are that the Baker-Campbell conjecture is a vanishing conjecture. The problem this work attempts to solve is to prove the Baker-Campbell conjecture. The main practical application of this work is that the rigorous proof of the vanishing conjecture provides a partial answer to the problem of proving the Baker-Campbell conjecture. \n\nThe implications for future research are that the Baker-Campbell conjecture may be an example of a non-triviality conjecture which is stronger than a vanishing conjecture.",

They have been observed to occur during both the high and low states, but their origin is still not understood. In this work we present comprehensive numerical simulations of CVs with mass ratios q = 0.7-0.9 that include tidal dissipation effects as well as magnetic braking. We find that for systems with orbital periods P orb < 3 hr, the inclusion of magnetic braking leads to an increase in the amplitude of the superhumps by up to a factor of two compared to previous results obtained without magnetic braking. For longer period systems, however, our models predict smaller amplitudes than those inferred observationally. This discrepancy may be due to additional physical processes such as irradiation or enhanced mass transfer rates at periastron passage which were neglected here. \n \n Keywords: Cataclysmic Variables",

        "In this work we present a general study of the energetic and dynamical behavior of a reduced version of the fully non-linear Kolmogorov-Lorenz equations, often referred to as the Lorenz-Kolmogorov equations. These equations, which describe the spatio-temporal evolution of a dynamical variable representing the areal density of particles in a fluid, are used to model a vast spectrum of physical, biological and chemical systems. As in classical Lorenz models, the dynamical variables in the Kolmogorov-Lorenz system consist of three state variables which denote the magnitude of velocity, density and temperature fluctuation, respectively. Contrary to the classical system, however, these state variables are not normalized to a difference of unity, but are related via an energy function which depends on the total energy of the dynamical system. We explore the parameter space of the model and identify regions where the system undergoes transitions between different dynamical states as well as exhibits chaos. We then perform a similar energetic analysis to the one recently proposed by Rudiger et. al. [Rudiger et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2015] for the classical Lorenz equations, and show that, despite the apparent difference in the dynamical behaviour of the two systems, the underlying structure of the two analyses is quite similar. We also explore the possibility of using linear and non-linear methods, typically employed in statistical mechanics to predict the long-term dynamics of the system. We show that both methods yield precise predictions in a large fraction of the dynamical regions explored, indicating that these systems may be used to generate long term predictions.",

        "The skin under your fingernails is called the cuticle. It protects the rest of your skin underneath from damage and protects your nails from being damaged. The cuticle is thin and tricky to notice, but it can be easily felt. The cuticle is made up of dead cells. Its main purpose is to help protect the living tissue underneath. The dead cells give the skin under your fingernails a soft layer to feel when you investigate under the skin with your finger. The soft layer helps the skin underneath protect itself from damage by putting up a barrier to protect the more delicate living tissue underneath. The dead cells help protect the more delicate living tissue underneath from being damaged by preventing it from coming into contact with the hard skin underneath. The dead cells help protect the more delicate living tissue underneath from being damaged by preventing it from coming into contact with the hard skin underneath. The skin under your fingernails is very thin and can easily be damaged. This makes the cuticle very important to your health as it protects your deeper skin layer from further harm. If the cuticle is not formed properly, or too thick, it can lead to issues such as skin infections. It can also lead to issues with nails as the dead cells on the surface of your nails can cause them to become thick and inflexible. This makes the nails more likely to break and cause injuries. It is also possible that dead skin under the cuticle can become infected and cause further problems. Damage to the cuticle can occur for many reasons. It is a protective layer that can be damaged by negligence such as digging in your fingernails or scratching too hard. It is also possible to damage the cuticle by ingesting chemicals or other elements that can harm the skin such as detergents or solvents. These are just some of the reasons why the cuticle can become damaged and need attention from the body. If you are worried that your cuticle is not forming properly, or is too thick, you can have it checked by a professional. This is a procedure called detailing the skin under your fingernails. A trained professional can give your skin under your fingernails the attention it needs with a cleansing procedure that can remove the dead skin cells that are causing issues. It can also be helpful to have your cuticle checked if you are worried that you have been injuring your skin by digging in your fingernails or scratching too hard. This too can be a procedure that a professional can perform to give your nails and fingers the attention they need. It is very important to care for the skin under your fingernails. This protects your body from potential infection and also helps the skin to stay healthy and strong. A healthy underlayer of skin helps the rest of your body function properly and protects your more delicate internal organs from harm.

        "People often feel like they are being watched and observed by society. This feeling is caused by an area in the brain called theEEG (electroencephalogram) that produces electrical signals in response to perceived threats. Society is watching and observing people more than ever before with surveillance cameras, IoT (the Internet of Things) devices, and machine learning algorithms. These surveillance cameras and IoT devices are collecting information about people's daily activities and behaviors and using artificial intelligence to analyze the data for patterns and trends that can identify threats. This type of electrical activity in the EEG is what produces the feeling of being watched. People have felt this way for centuries, since the beginning of civilization. The \"Big Brother\" from George Orwell's 1984 is one example of this phenomenon. Television shows, movies, and advertising campaigns tend to reinforce this perception of being watched, which contributes to people feeling anxious and afraid to be out in public places. Even when people are alone in their homes, they may feel like someone is in the room with them. They may turn around, but there is no one there. This phenomenon is not limited to people in modern society; people have felt like they were being watched since the beginning of human civilization. People feel like they are being watched not just because of technological advances that capture information about people's activities, but also because humans have a natural fear of being threatened and attacked. This natural fear is an inherited survival instinct that is very well documented in biology and psychology. Threats to humans' safety and survival have always generated this electrical activity in theEEG and this feeling that someone or something is watching them. Therefore, people feel like they are always being watched, even when they are not being watched. Even though society may be watching and observing people more than ever before, this does not mean people live in fear and are constantly anxious. On the contrary, humans have evolved to be wary of threats and afraid of being attacked. Therefore, people feel like they are being watched, even when noone is watching them. This feeling that people have of being watched and observed by society is caused by an area in the brain called the EEG, which is why people often feel like they are being watched when they are alone in their home. People often wonder if they are being watched, and this feeling of being watched tends to reinforce people's natural instincts and behaviors. Therefore, people are afraid to be alone, and feel safer when they are in groups. People also tend to feel attracted to others who seem to be watching them, whether they are or not. This is another instinctive human behavior that is often reinforced by the feeling of being watched. People who suffer from social anxiety experience this feeling of being watched and observed by society more intensely than others. These people tend to live in a state of constant anxiety and fear, because their brain is producing this electrical activity in response to perceived threats that",
        "It is important to understand that while the Earth is a solid body, it is also composed of individual elements, meaning that it is not actually solid on a molecular level. When we pump oil out of the ground, we are displacing a form of matter, as well as taking up both space and having a change in mass. The void left by the removal of oil is taken up by some of the surrounding material. This displacement of material both above and below ground can cause visible structural effects on the surface. This is especially true around oil-drilling sites where the drilling process can cause the surface to shift and buckle.\n\nIn terms of the mass displacement to the Earth's surface, it’s important to note that the mass displacement caused by oil drilling is very small, and the effects it has on the Earth's rotation rate would be very minimal. To put it into perspective, the Earth's mass is roughly 5,973,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (5.97 x 10^24) kilograms, while the mass of oil extracted from the Earth is only around 0.0006% of the Earth's total mass! So, the mass displacement caused by the removal of oil is really quite small.\n\nIn general, the effects of mass displacement due to oil extraction on the Earth’s rotation rate would be negligible, or in other words, imperceptible, as the consequent offset in mass is too small to have any significant effect. The only known instance of the Earth's rotation rate changing to any discernible degree is attributed to the melting of the polar ice caps, which leads to a significantly greater change in mass and volume.",

        "The paper \"The Variational Walkback Algorithm\" proposes a new algorithm for training generative models that improves on the state of the art in terms of both speed and performance. Specifically, the authors focus on models that make use of latent variables, which can capture complex, high-dimensional correlations in the data that are difficult to model otherwise. The goal of the paper is to address the computational challenges associated with training these models and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on a range of benchmark datasets.\n\nStrengths:\n- The proposed algorithm is innovative and well-motivated, building on previous work in the area of generative modeling. The paper provides a clear and intuitive explanation of why the Variational Walkback Algorithm might be expected to outperform other algorithms in certain contexts.\n- The authors provide a thorough experimental evaluation on a range of benchmark datasets, benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods, and providing detailed statistics and analysis of results.\n- The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to follow along with the technical details.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The paper could benefit from providing a more thorough discussion of possible limitations or constraints of the proposed algorithm. While there is some discussion of the trade-offs between different hyperparameters and model architectures, a more explicit discussion of when the Variational Walkback Algorithm might not be the best choice for certain types of problems would be useful.\n- The paper provides a substantial amount of technical detail, which may be difficult to follow for readers without a strong background in generative modeling or optimization. Providing a more intuitive explanation, possibly through additional examples or visualizations, could make the paper more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nOverall, the Variational Walkback Algorithm is a promising contribution to the field of generative modeling, and the presented experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in practice. The proposed solution builds on previous work in a novel way and appears to be well-suited to certain types of modeling tasks. While there are certainly opportunities for further exploration and refinement, this paper provides a solid foundation for future research in this area.",
        " John Gibson (born February 28, 1945 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American former professional basketball player. He was a guard and small forward who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for twelve seasons. Gibson attended Overbrook High School in Philadelphia and then attended the University of Iowa, where he played college basketball. As a sophomore, he was a key contributor to Iowa's 1967 Big Ten Conference championship team that earned an invitation to the Final Four. He was named to the Big Ten All-Conference Team in 1968 and 1969, and was named second-team All-American by The Sporting News in 1969. He was inducted into the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame in 1969, and is currently listed among the all-time Iowa greats by the University of Iowa athletics department. Gibson was selected with the eighth overall pick in the 1969 NBA draft by the Baltimore Bullets. He was quickly traded to the Detroit Pistons, where he played for five seasons. He averaged 17.7 points per game in 1972–73, his last season with the Pistons. Gibson then signed with the San Diego Rockets for the 1974–75 season. He had a career-high 19 points per game average that season, and was named to the All-NBA Second Team. He was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers during the 1975–76 season. Gibson played seven more seasons with the 76ers, playing in 619 games and averaging 10.5 points, 2.6 rebounds and 3 assists per game. He was a key part of the 76ers teams that advanced to the NBA finals in 1977 and 1980, though they lost both series. He played his last NBA game in 1981 before retiring. After retiring as a player, Gibson developed an interest in coaching. During the 1981–82 season, he was the head coach of the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association for two months. Later, he coached in the USBL, making the playoffs four times and winning the championship in 1989. He was inducted into the USBL Hall of Fame in 2008. Gibson was also the head basketball coach of Gordon State College from 2001 to 2003. Outside of basketball, Gibson has been a volunteer at local community centers and schools in Philadelphia. He received the ProCamps NBA Staff Excellence Award in 2010 for his work in the community. In 2020, Gibson was inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame for his contributions to the game of basketball. He currently lives in the Philadelphia area with his wife and three children.",

        "\n\nWe present a catalog of 667 hard-spectrum XMM-Newton sources observed with the XMM-SSC, of which 88 are previously uncataloged. We determine the luminosities, distances, and blueshifts of these sources based on their optical/NIR observations, and use these values to derive the absolute ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray fluxes and the spectral indices of the sources. We find that the X-ray luminosities of the sources in our sample are, on average, 1.5 kml$^{-1}$, with a range from $3 \\times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $8 \\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find that a significant fraction (70%) of our hard-spectrum XMM-Newton sources exhibit count rates that are modulated with the orbital period of the XMM-Newton spacecraft, in agreement with the prediction of Smith & 1996 that such modulation would be present for sources that are gravitationally lensed by the accretion disc of the Galactic black hole. The largest X-ray source in our sample is the microquasar SGR 1900+14, which is a potential candidate for being a future target for XMM-Newton observation. The X-ray flux of this source is $1.75 \\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which makes it the second brightest X-ray source in our sample. We have derived absolute X-ray fluxes for all of the bright XMM-Newton sources in our sample, except for SGR 1900+14, by combining our XMM-Newton observations with archival data from the Rossi-RXTE satellite.

        "There are several aspects to this question, so I will address it from a historiographical, an economic and a sociological perspective. From a historiographical perspective, it is often noted that it was mainly the elites who pushed for unification, most notably in the case of Italy and Germany. This was in particular the case in France and Russia, as the lower classes were largely occupied with securing food supply and basic living standards. The revolution of 1848 is a prime example of this, as it was initially aimed at establishing a constitutional monarchy in France. However, as the unrest continued, the issue of royal succession became a focal point for the two groups that would eventually unite to form the French Republic: The Orleanists, led by Prince Louis-Philippe, and the republicans, led by President Louis Napoleon Bonaparte. Ultimately, the republicans won the 1848 election, and launched a war on the Orleanists. A similar situation applied in Russia, where the more liberal advanced democratic revolutionaries (known as \"men of April\") initially tried to maintain the Russian empire as a constitutional monarchy, under Alexander II. However, as this did not satisfy the increasingly vocal demands of the liberal intelligentsia, the issue of constitutional reform was raised, leading to the peasant-based liberal revolution of Alexander II being replaced with the more conservative Alexander III. Ultimately, it was the February Revolution of 1917 that replaced the tsar with the bourgeois-based Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. The economic situation at the time also played a role in the speed of political change. For example, in Italy and Germany, the agricultural sector was largely present in the south, while industry was much more developed in the north. Since these regions were separated by mountain ranges, it was more difficult to administer than in France and Russia. It is therefore not surprising that the northern German states united first, forming the German Empire in 1871. Conversely, the economic disparity between France and Italy was not as great as that between the German Empire and the Russian Empire. There was already some form of unification, through the creation of a common French franc in 1852. The last reason for the delay in Italian and German unification is more sociological, as it had to do with the different perceptions of the imperial elites of these countries. While the German elite was keen on centralisation, the Italian elite was rather keen on federalisation, meaning that the state would be subdivided into provinces and that the elites of these provinces would decide upon these divisions. This desire to let the different provinces decide upon their own future was another factor that slowed down Italian unification. This delay was understandable, since the south had enjoyed more representation than the north in the late 19th Century German Confederation. However, since World War I, the elites of the \"German\" and \"Italian\" countries have largely abandoned these pretensions, with the result that the division between Pruss",

It has recently been shown that Residual Networks behave like ensembles of relatively shallow networks. We show that these ensemble are dynamic: while initially the virtual ensemble is mostly at depths lower than half the network’s depth, as training progresses, it becomes deeper and deeper. The main mechanism that controls the dynamic ensemble behavior is the scaling introduced, e.g., by the Batch Normalization technique. We explain this behavior and demonstrate the driving force behind it. As a main tool in our analysis, we employ generalized spin glass models, which we also use in order to study the number of critical points in the optimization of Residual Networks. We show that the number of critical points is finite and that the number of critical points is related to the depth of the network. We also show that the number of critical points is related to the number of parameters in the network.",

        "Prior to the emergence of automobiles, cities relied on horses and other forms of animal power for transportation and labor needs. As the number of horses grew in urban areas, so did incidents of horses dying or being injured in traffic accidents. While this may have been an accepted part of life at the time, cities sought to mitigate casualties as much as possible. \n\nOne way in which cities attempted to reduce horse deaths was through the passage of traffic rules and regulations that regulated traffic speed as well as horses and other domestic animals. For example, in New York a 1865 law declared that “nothing shall be driven faster than a man on foot at a pace exceeding six miles an hour.” Similarly, a London edict from the same time period declared that “all horses to be driven within the city shall be ridden at no more than a trot.” In addition to reducing traffic speed, these laws also specified other transgressions or aggressive acts that could be considered public nuisances and punishable by law, such as riding horses or donkeys through markets or placing animals in places of public worship.\n\nCities also implemented other measures to address horses dying or being injured in traffic accidents. Street cleaners were hired to quickly remove dead animals from the roads, while “hospitals” were opened to care for injured horses. In some cities, omnibuses or horse-drawn carts were hired to carry wounded animals off the streets. Moreover, insurance policies were developed that provided compensation for animal owners in the event of a traffic accident. \n\nIn order to fully address the issue of horse casualties in heavy traffic, however, cities needed to drastically limit the number of carriages, carts, and other forms of animals transporting goods and services. This necessitated the development of a safe and reliable form of transportation that could replace the horse. Over time, the automobile filled this void and vastly improved the safety of city roads. The transition away from horses and towards cars has allowed cities to reduce animal casualties due to traffic accidents, leading to a safer and more efficient city life. \n\nToday, cities still grapple with traffic safety, though the issue of animal casualties is largely a thing of the past. While cities no longer rely on horses for transportation needs, a legacy of regulations and patents still remains, serving as a reminder of the response of cities to the horses dying or being injured in traffic accidents of a bygone era.",

        "When a ship is in rough waters, the waves that hit the ship create the motion that passengers feel on board. In the case of a pool on the ship, the waves in the pool will mimic the waves that hit the ship, but to a lesser extent.\n\nThe reason for this is due to the laws of physics. Waves in a pool are created by disturbances in the water, such as someone jumping in or a wind blowing across the surface. These disturbances create ripples in the water that spread out in all directions. However, these ripples are much smaller than the waves hitting the ship, and they also have a limited amount of energy. As such, they cannot mimic the full impact of the waves hitting the ship.\n\nThat being said, the waves in the pool will still move in response to the ship's motion. As the ship pitches and rolls in the waves, the water in the pool will slosh back and forth. This can create a feeling of motion in the pool, though it will be much less intense than the movement felt on board the ship.\n\nOverall, while the waves in a pool on a ship can mimic the ship's motion to some degree, they cannot fully replicate the effects of the waves hitting the ship.

        "Theoretical physicists have recently proposed a new paradigm, called the Slingshot mechanism, to explain the success of the inflationary paradigm. In this model, our universe popped into existence near a boundary of another, larger universe. This boundary has a highly curved geometry, which could lead to fluctuation of the metric across the boundary. These metric fluctuations can act as a stochastic gravitational wave background (SWB), which seeds the formation of structures in the universe. We calculate the power spectrum of SWB generated in the Slingshot model, and compare it with the power spectrum of Primordial scalar spectrum (PS) calculated by the WMAP team. We show that, for some parameter choices, the SWB and PS are nearly identical. We conclude that a concrete realization of the Slingshot model could account for the success of inflation without the need for fine-tuning.

        "Melting tungsten requires specialized equipment due to its high melting point. It is often necessary to use temperatures of up to 2,800 degrees Celsius to melt tungsten, which is well above the melting point of traditional torches, crucibles, and even many metals. \n\nOne of the most common methods for melting tungsten is the induction melting system. This system uses alternating magnetic fields to heat the metal without requiring direct physical contact. The tungsten is placed inside a container made from a material that is a poorer conductor of heat than tungsten such as graphite or molybdenum. The alternating magnetic fields produced by the induction coil cause currents to flow through the tungsten. These eddy currents generate heat inside the tungsten, which then melts it. \n\nAnother option is to use an electron beam furnace. This type of furnace uses a beam of high-energy electrons that is directed onto the tungsten, which causes it to quickly heat up and melt. The electron beam furnace is able to quickly heat the tungsten due to its high power and short heating times, and it requires no additional shielding or protection since the beam is extremely precise and not dangerous.\n\nFinally, some specialized torches and crucibles are capable of withstanding the extremely high temperatures necessary to melt tungsten. However, these torches and crucibles are usually much more expensive than traditional types, and they require much more careful handling in order to prevent them from breaking or melting during use. \n\nAll of these methods are effective for melting tungsten, and the best option for any particular job will depend on the needs and goals of the project. With the right tools and adequate safety precautions, tungsten can be melted down effectively and safely.",
        "The paper titled \"An Information Retrieval Approach for Finding Dependent Subspaces of Multiple Views\" by Wu et al. proposes an approach for identifying dependent subspaces in the context of data fusion. The main idea is to leverage the similarity between the raw data matrices to identify the common information that is invariant to specific transformations. The invariant information is then projected out to identify the dependent subspaces. The approach is evaluated on data fusion from multiple sensors and a kernel-based approach for identifying the dependency across the views is also included. The performance of the method is analyzed and the benefits of using the proposed method for data cleansing and missing value imputation are also highlighted. Overall the method presents an interesting approach for identifying dependent subspaces and it could be of interest to the community. However, the work could benefit from a more comprehensive experimental evaluation, including a larger number of datasets and a wider variety of transformations. Audience The paper is of interest to the data fusion and distributed data analysis community, in particular to those working on distributed sensor networks and streaming data. Type of Reviewer I have chosen to do a technical, comment-based review. Reviewer Notes As the paper presents an approach for identifying dependent subspaces, I will concentrate my review on aspects related to the description of the approach and to the evaluation. In particular, I will comment on the choice of data transformations, the choice of the measure of dependence and on the validation method. In addition, I would like to note that the code used to generate the results presented in the paper is available on Github (see Section 5). Reviewer Comments This is a very well written paper that presents an approach for identifying dependent subspaces. The approach is general and can be applied to a wide range of applications. The section on choice of data transformations is very well written. In addition to traditional choices such as rotation, scaling and shearing, the authors also include random and non-linear transformations. These transformations cover most situations that may arise in practice. I agree with the choice of the mutual information measure to characterize the similarity between the data matrices. The choice of a divergence measure is justified as it facilitates the analysis of the algorithm's behavior. The validation method is based on a leave one out approach, which is common in this type of studies. This is a well written paper that I would recommend to a broader audience.",
        "This article examines the implications of long-range order on alloy and magnetic phase transitions. Using a first principles analysis of the order-disorder transition in alloys, the authors demonstrate that the ordering energy depends on temperature due to thermal vibrations, that zero-point vibrational energy can be included in inter-nuclear potential energy terms and that core energy contributions to the ordering energy are stored in superlattice lines. It is further expounded that the effect of electron-phonon interactions on ordering energy cannot be ignored due to its magnitude relative to ordering energy at transition temperatures and must be incorporated via a current theoretical formalism in order to accurately model temperature related phenomena. The authors also suggest considering an isotope effect for magnetic phase transitions at temperatures below the Debye temperature which was recently observed in magnetic phase transitions. This highlights the importance of acknowledging electron-phonon interactions in all models of magnetism in order to ensure consistency with experiment.",
        "This paper is concerned with the study, classification, and elimination of smooth codimension-one foliations on a smooth manifold $M$, with Morse-type isolated singularities. Additionally, the paper seeks to determine if classical results, such as those of Haefliger and Novikov, concerning the existence of non-degenerate singular points and closed transverse curves, respectively, still hold in the presence of singularities. To this end, we first describe the possible configurations of pairs of singularities and the corresponding codimension invariant sets. We then provide an elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and saddle-saddle configurations. In the second part of the paper, we define weakly stable components of the singular set, $Sing(\\F)$, as those components admitting a neighborhood where all the leaves are compact. If $Sing(\\F)$ contains only such components, which are smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic to $S^1$, we can prove an extension of Haefliger's theorem. Finally, if the foliation possesses a closed curve, transverse to it, then a Novikov-like result is attained.",

        "\nWe consider the gravity dual of the 1+1 dimensional Bjorken expansion, which is an effective field theory with a set of axiomatically defined variables, that has been proposed as a possible effective theory for the early universe by Brandenburg andructose [hep-th/0609105]. The purpose of this work is to study the behavior of the dual theory as the ratio of the two scales approaches one. In particular we find a threshold value of the ratio, below which the theory is able to produce a late time accelerating expansion, in a fashion analogous to the way the original Bjorken expansion produces an early time accelerating expansion. The results are obtained by using the general machinery of the geometrically finite jet space formalism. The geometrically finite jet space allows one to rigorously define the relevant expansion and the relevant variable to be expanded. We find that the late time accelerating expansion is driven by a gravitational sink generated by a self-reproduction mechanism. This is similar to the way the early time accelerating expansion is driven by a cosmological constant generated by a self-reproduction mechanism in the original Bjorken expansion.",

        " The Phantom Freighter, also known as the Flying Dutchman, is a legendary sailing ship believed to be cursed and doomed to sail the seas for all eternity. The phantom ship is said to appear suddenly and unexpectedly out of a dense fog and is often reported to be illuminated by ghostly blue lights. It is believed that anyone who sets eyes upon this ill-fated ship is doomed to be taken by the devil. Originating from European maritime mythology and folklore, the phantom freighter is most commonly associated with the Flying Dutchman, a vessel cursed by the Devil after its captain, Vander Decken VI, refused to turn back despite warnings of an impending storm. In mythology, the freighter is said to sail endlessly in search of salvation, but its fate remains cursed, as it can only rest when it has been crossed by a living person. Perhaps the most famous sighting of the phantom freighter occurred in 1881, when the cargo ship godspeed reported seeing a strange sailing vessel, entirely crew less and shrouded in fog. As they drew closer, the crew of the godspeed claimed to have seen a woman on board the phantom freighter, leading many to believe that it was the Flying Dutchman itself. The legend of the phantom freighter has been featured in countless works of literature and film, from William Hope Hodgson’s 1904 novel The Ghost Pirates to Disney’s 2003 film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. It has also inspired songs, such as The Dubliners’ “The Flying Dutchman” and Iron Maiden’s “The Phantom of the Opera.” Today, the Phantom Freighter remains a captivating figure of folklore and mythology, and continues to be a source of fascination for sailors, adventurers and authors alike. Despite the mysterious and ghostly reputation it has built up over the centuries, it is a reminder of the power of the natural world and a warning against the dangers of ignoring it.",

        "\n\nWe present the results of the first direct measurement of the diameter of a star filling its Roche lobe, the semi-detached binary SS Leporis. We used the Very Long Baseline Interferometry technique with the VINCI instrument on the VLT, resolving the binary and obtaining a measure of the orbital separation and the projected separation between the two stars. We found that the stars are approximately 1.5 times the diameter of the Sun, which implies that the orbital separation is at most 8 solar radii. The observed orbital period is 55.4 minutes, which is slightly longer than the orbital period obtained from a previous spectroscopic study, but in very good agreement with the period predicted by theory for a system with the properties of SS Leporis. We find that the observed orbital elements are in very good agreement with the predictions of theory, and we can therefore use this system as a benchmark to test the validity of the assumptions made in the theory of stellar Roche lobe overflow.",
        "The paper of Learning and Policy Search in Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Bayesian Neural Networks is an interesting and challenging problem with real-world application. The main idea of the paper is that the transition dynamics can be described by Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) that include stochastic input variables. These input variables allow us to capture complex statistical patterns in the transition dynamics, which are usually missed by alternative modeling approaches. Then, the BNNs are trained by minimizing $\\alpha$-divergences with $\\alpha = 0.5$. This combination of methods allows the method to perform policy search in stochastic dynamical systems. In addition to providing theoretical analysis, the paper also provides a useful implementation with code that can be used by researchers to perform policy search in practice. This implementation is unique compared to other RL approaches that use policy search because it allows users to perform policy search in complex models with stochastic input variables. This implementation also has the potential to increase research in policy search in a variety of applications because it is a general framework that can use a policy search method such as optimistic multiple sequence restarts, robust policy gradient methods or approximate policy iteration to perform policy search. Thus, the code has potential to be easily adapted to new problems by adding customization in the solver. aré however, there are several aspects of the paper that need to be clarified to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience: - The presentation of the model is very concise and lacks in details. For example, a detailed description of how the input variables are generated and how the BNNs are trained could improve the understanding of the paper for people not used to working with these types of models. For example, it may be useful to provide an illustrative example that shows a time series of the input variables and how the BNNs are trained for one example. - The paper presents the method in a very general form. However, this can make it difficult to follow for a broader audience, especially if they are not familiar with stochastic dynamical systems or BNNs. The basic concepts of dynamical systems, Bayesian analysis and stochastic processes are relatively basic. Thus, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed introduction to these topics at the beginning of the paper or present more concrete examples that describe the different models and problems that the method can be applied to. - More details about the applications and empirical evaluation of the method would be useful for the paper. Overall, this paper presents an innovative idea that has the potential to significantly improve the state of the field in different application areas that can benefit from policy search in stochastic dynamical systems.",

        "In this work, we investigate the relationship between dimer models, free fermions, and super quantum mechanics. Dimer models are a type of statistical mechanics model that describe the formation of dimers on a lattice, while free fermions are particles that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics and can move freely in a lattice. Super quantum mechanics, on the other hand, is a generalization of quantum mechanics that incorporates supersymmetry. We aim to understand how these three concepts are related and use this understanding to gain insights into the behavior of physical systems.\n\nTo achieve this, we begin by introducing the mathematical framework for dimer models, free fermions, and super quantum mechanics. We then explore how these frameworks interact, focusing on the mathematics that underline their relationship. Our key idea is that certain dimer models have a hidden supersymmetry that emerges when they are described using free fermions. We formalize this relationship using mathematical tools, including complex analysis and representation theory.\n\nOur results show that understanding the relationship between dimer models, free fermions, and super quantum mechanics provides a new perspective on the behavior of physical systems. We demonstrate this by using our insights to address several open problems in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics. Specifically, we use our understanding of supersymmetry in dimer models to predict the existence of certain phase transitions in materials science. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications of our work, including its potential applications in fields such as quantum computing and high-energy physics.",

        "Infrared waves have longer wavelengths than other types of electromagnetic waves so they can penetrate objects better causing them to warm up from within instead of burning or melting their outer surfaces like shorter wavelength radiations do. In addition, most materials absorb IR more readily than visible light which causes it to be trapped inside an object increasing its temperature further. This makes it easier to detect using thermal imaging cameras that measure emitted infrared radiation as opposed to detecting it directly by looking at how bright something looks in normal lighting conditions. It also explains why you feel warmer when standing next to someone wearing a thick winter coat made out of wool because wool traps infrared radiation very well but reflects visible light poorly making your body's surface appear cooler while still retaining enough heat to make you comfortable. Because it's not actually hotter than surrounding areas this type of heating effect isn't noticeable until you're close enough to see what surrounds you clearly through gaps between fibers",

Radio waves are part of a range of electromagnetic radiation, which also includes light and infrared. If the alien had vision beyond the human spectrum, they might not see radio waves, which means they could potentially be exposed to harmful amounts of radiation.

        " Please write a peer review for the paper of Evaluation of Defensive Methods for DNNs against Multiple Adversarial Evasion Models, its main content is as below: Due to deep cascades of nonlinear units, deep neural networks (DNNs) can automatically learn non-local generalization priors from data and have achieved high performance in various applications. However, such properties have also opened a door for adversaries to generate the so-called adversarial examples to fool DNNs. Specifically, adversaries can inject small perturbations to the input data and therefore decrease the performance of deep neural networks significantly. Even worse, these adversarial examples have the transferability to attack a black-box model based on finite queries without knowledge of the target model.  Therefore, we aim to empirically compare different defensive strategies against various adversary models and analyze the cross-model efficiency for these robust learners. We conclude that the adversarial retraining framework also has the transferability, which can defend adversarial examples without requiring prior knowledge of the adversary models. We compare the general adversarial retraining framework with the state-of-the-art robust deep neural networks, such as distillation, autoencoder stacked with classifier (AEC), and our improved version, IAEC, to evaluate their robustness as well as the vulnerability in terms of the distortion required to mislead the learner. Our experimental results show that the adversarial retraining framework can defend most of the adversarial examples notably and consistently without adding additional vulnerabilities or performance penalty to the original model.\n\nComment: Please do not post your homework questions here.\n\nComment: @D.W.

        "The paper 'Incorporating long-range consistency in CNN-based texture generation' presents an approach to enhance the quality and realism of computer-generated textures by incorporating long-range consistency within the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework. The authors pointed out in their paper that many existing methods focus only on local structure, failing to capture the overall consistency of textures that exists across multiple scales.\n\nOne of the main strengths of the paper is the clarity of the methodology used to achieve this improvement. The authors' approach can leverage the internal representation of the CNNs in order to extract a complete distribution of features that capture the global characteristics of textures. This leads to the generation of textures with a more natural appearance and improved visual quality.\n\nAnother strength of the paper is the detailed evaluation of the proposed approach. The authors provide a quantitative analysis based on statistical tests that compare their approach with existing methods. This evaluation highlights the benefits of incorporating long-range consistency in texture generation, showing that it leads to significant improvements in both the visual quality and diversity of the generated textures.\n\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses that need to be addressed. One of the main weaknesses lies in the limitation of the scope of experiments. The authors do not provide sufficient analysis on the generalization ability of their approach, particularly on varying levels of noise, image under different lighting conditions and rotations. The evaluation only focuses on a limited dataset while it will be worthwhile to evaluate the performance over larger datasets.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed paper presents a valuable contribution in the field of texture generation by introducing a method that improves the overall appearance and consistency of generated textures. The comprehensiveness and clarity of the methodology and the detailed evaluation make it a strong candidate for publication. However, it would benefit from further exploration and analysis of the proposed approach in more diverse contexts to demonstrate its generalizability.",

We show that the rate at which reactants are consumed is determined by the geometry of the medium through an effective fractal dimension D(t) that evolves with time according to a nonlinear differential equation. The solution of this equation depends on the initial conditions and can be obtained numerically using standard methods. In particular we find that if the initial distribution has compact support then the system reaches equilibrium after some characteristic relaxation time t*. For times larger than t* the consumption rate becomes independent of the initial condition and coincides with the one predicted by classical mean field theories. This result suggests that the dynamics of chemical reactions in complex environments may be described by simple models based only on geometrical information about the environment.",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Room temperature spin polarized magnetic semiconductor\".\nAbstract:\nWe report on the room-temperature ferromagnetism in Mn-doped ZnO thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The Curie temperatures are found to be around 300 K for all samples with different doping levels, which is much higher than that reported previously. We also find that the magnetization increases linearly as the applied field decreases and shows hysteresis loops at low fields. These results indicate that the observed ferromagnetic behavior may originate from exchange coupling between localized spins rather than intrinsic ferromagnetism. \n \n In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing new materials for spintronic applications such as nonvolatile memory devices or logic circuits based on the manipulation of electron spins instead of charge carriers1-5 . Among these materials, diluted magnetic semiconductors have attracted considerable attention because they can combine both electronic and magnetic functionalities into one material6-8 .\n \n\n\nZnO-based DMSs have been extensively studied due to their wide band gap energy (3.37 eV), large exciton binding energy (60 meV)9 , high transparency10-12 , and good chemical stability13-15 . However, it remains challenging to achieve room-temperature ferromagnetically ordered states in ZnO-based DMSs16-18 . Although several groups have recently demonstrated room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering in various types of ZnO-based DMS systems19-24 , most of them show relatively small saturation magnetizations25-27 . \n \n Here we report on the observation of room-temperature ferromagnetisms in Mn-doped ZnObased DMSs prepared using pulsed laser deposition28-30 . Our experimental data clearly demonstrate that the dopant concentration plays an important role in determining the Curie temperature31-33 . For example, our sample with x = 0.5% exhibits a Curie temperature of about 300 K while those with lower concentrations exhibit smaller values ranging from 150-250 K34-36 . Moreover, we observe that the magnetization increases almost linearly when decreasing the external magnetic field below 1 T and displays hysteretic behaviors at very low fields. This indicates that the observed ferr",
        "\nThis paper aims to investigate two equations of state (EOS) obtained from high temperature QCD, and adapt them for making predictions for relativistic heavy ion collisions. We extract equilibrium quark and gluon distribution functions from the EOS, and show that this method enables a determination of the transport and other properties of the quark gluon plasma, which is then described via a quasi-particle model. The first EOS is a perturbative approach with contributions up to $O(g^5)$ and then an improved EOS with contributions up to $O(g^6 ln(\\frac{1}{g}))$ is presented that accounts for non-perturbative hard thermal contributions. We show the interaction effects are captured by the effective chemical potential of the gluons and quarks for both EOS. We determine the screening lengths as an application, and see drastic differences depending on the chosen EOS which could be used to differentiate them in heavy ion collisions.",

        "The current paper attempts to answer the following question: Is the simple but tough-to-beat baseline representing the sentence by a weighted average of the word vectors a reasonable starting point, or should one try a more sophisticated method involving RNN's and LSTM's? The paper shows that the simple baseline is a good starting point, and even improves the embeddings designed by Wieting et al. In particular, the simple baseline beats sophisticated supervised methods including RNN's and LSTM's. The paper also gives a theoretical explanation of the success of the above simple baseline method using a latent variable generative model for sentences, which is a simple extension of the model in Arora et al. (TACL'16) with new \"smoothing\" terms that allow for words occurring out of context, as well as high probabilities for words like and, not in all contexts. The paper is well written with clear descriptions, and presents thorough experiments with detailed analysis. The results are interesting and useful, as the simple baseline is a good starting point for computing sentence embeddings. Strength: The paper presents a simple but effective baseline for computing sentence embeddings. Weakness: The paper only validates the effectiveness on a limited set of textual similarity tasks. More experiments on different datasets are needed to confirm the result. I have no significant problems to report regarding this paper. I have read the paper and feel confident to comment. I would like to highlight a couple of points, though: 1. I feel that the simple baseline can actually be further improved by using several recent advances in word representation learning, such as sentence segmentation, better word sense disambiguation, and more effective weighting schemes. These could be easily incorporated in the simple baseline model. 2. Another limitation of the current implementation is the high likelihood of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, especially novel OOV words. One way to address this is to train a separate model to predict the vectors for OOV words, and then use the predictions to regularize the simple model. Overall, this is a useful contribution to the sentence embedding area, and the paper makes a good case for the effectiveness of using simpler methods, in this case the baseline model, as a starting point for improving performance.",

        " The 2013 New Zealand local elections were held on 12 October 2013. This was the first local election to be held since the re-introduction of the single transferable voting system in 2010. The 2013 elections were contested by 59 district health boards (DHBs), 19 city councils and one regional council. All DHBs, councils and the regional council had elections for the mayor, for ward councillors where applicable, and for community board members in the respective areas. The elections saw a steady decrease in voter turnout from the previous 2007 elections and the lowest turnout since 2002, with a total of 50.52%. Fewer women voted than men at every level; only one incumbent mayor was taken out of office, Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown. The overall trend of the 2013 elections was a swing to the centre and far right, with the taxpayer and advocacy group Right-Wing achieving an unprecedented level of success, winning a third of all mayoral elections and a majority in five of the major metropolitan areas. The success of Right-Wing saw increased scrutiny over local policies. In Auckland, the issue of transport policies, port shareholdings and rates increases drove the campaigns. The Auckland Council represented by Len Brown also took a hardline stance against Right-Wing victories in the form of a referendum on reducing Council/Governing Body representation from 20 to 16 members. In the Christchurch City Council, the incumbent mayor Bob Parker was returned for a fourth term. Mayor Parker, whose approval rating has been steadily increasing since the 2010/11 earthquakes, saw the mayoral race become a referendum on the city's response to the earthquakes and the rebuild project, with continuity representing a focal point for his successful campaign. The 2013 New Zealand local elections saw a significant drop in voter participation, attributed to apathy towards local politics and incumbents. The results, however, showed a distinct swing to the centre and right-wing, a move that is expected to continue over the coming years given the overall trend of local politics.",

        " Zamyn-Üüd, known in Mongolian as \"The Golden Triangle\", is a city in Mongolia located in the Eastern region on the Mongolian-Chinese border. It is the capital of the Dornogovi Province, and is the third largest city in Mongolia with a population of approximately 33,000. The city was originally founded in the 1880s by a small group of nomads who settled on the Tumurkhuul River, a tributary of the Nariin Gol. The town's principal industry is animal husbandry, due to its proximity to China and strong relationships with Chinese markets. Its close economic ties to China have contributed to Zamyn-Üüd's steady population population growth and economic development. Other industries in the city include mARkets for cashmere production, weaving, fur trading, tanning, and honey production. The town also has a small industrial zone and a few large factories, such as coal and brass production. The city is served by Zamyn-Üüd Airport, located around 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) south-east of the city centre. The airport is the second busiest international airport in Mongolia, and serves Gobi desert and Central Asian sleeper trains. The main attraction in the area is the Gobi Desert. The desert has long been an important source of inspiration for Mongolian nomads, who travel here are to hunt for steppe animals, ride horses, and meet with other nomads. Tourists can also visit the nearby Yoliin Am Canyon, the beautiful Ongi Monastery, the Erdene-Zuu Monastery, and Tsagaan Suvarga, an impressive cliff formation. Zamyn-Üüd is also home to several prestigious universities, such as the National University of Mongolia and Mongolian University of Science and Technology. The city's culture is also quite vibrant, and many traditional festivals, such as Tsagaan Sar and Naadam, are held here annually. Though the city has experienced economic growth over the last few decades, some of its citizens are still living in poverty. The city's infrastructure and services remain largely inadequate for its flourishing population. Despite its economic challenges, Zamyn-Üüd is nevertheless one of the most popular destinations in Mongolia.",

        "Pakhar (2017) was a significant storm in the 2017 Pacific typhoon season. It is the second named storm and the ninth system of the season. It was the third named storm of Season Offensive of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season. It was a Category 4 typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with maximum winds of 150 mph, making it the strongest September typhoon ever recorded in the Western Pacific. Pakhar caused extreme rainfall and flooding over northern Luzon, Philippines, leading to catastrophic damages and deaths. Pakhar was both the first-ever \"monsoon storm\" of the summer of 2017 in the Northwest Pacific and the strongest typhoon of the year in the Western Pacific, as well as the third-strongest Typhoon of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season. Pakhar formed from the monsoon trough on September 10, 2017, and rapidly intensified into a Category 4 typhoon 24 hours later. It moved quickly west-northwestward and gradually intensified into a severe typhoon on September 11. Pakhar achieved its peak intensity as a powerful Category 4 typhoon with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 915 mbar on September 12. Pakhar started to weaken as it moved over cooler waters in the northern Pacific, and it soon became a Category 3 typhoon. It accelerated to the west-southwest and steadily weakened. Pakhar made landfall in the Chinese province of Guangdong as a minimal Category 1 typhoon on September 15. After emerging into the South China Sea, it turned south-southeast and moved ashore Phillippines as a minimal typhoon on September 17. Pakhar weakened rapidly and became a weak tropical storm overland and was soon downgraded to a tropical depression. It turned southwestwards and moved inland over Thailand and Cambodia, before it was last noted as a weak circulation on September 21. Pakhar, together with Haima and Rammasun, caused catastrophic damages and deaths in the Philippines, leading to humanitarian disasters. In Luzon alone, Pakhar was responsible for extremely heavy rain and flooding, which was one of the worst in over 50 years, causing widespread damages and severe loss of life. Approximately 120 people were killed and nearly half a million people were left homeless. Heavy damage was also recorded in neighboring regions in the Philippines, such as Pampanga and Bulacan. In addition, the storm was noted as one of the strongest rainstorms to hit Metro Manila in over a decade. Power outages were also reported throughout the country, leaving over 4 million people in the worst-hit regions without electricity. Overall, the storm caused at least PHP120 ($2.6 million) in damages and several billion Philippine pesos ($24.4 million) in damages and lost wages.",

If you're looking to add a touch of vintage to your images, here's how to achieve the vintage look in Photoshop.\n\n1. Use the wrong exposure.\n\nWhen you take a photo with your camera, it will usually be exposed to light correctly. However, if you want to achieve the vintage look, you'll need to underexpose the image. This means that the image will be darker than it should be, which will give it a more vintage feel.\n\n2. Use the wrong white balance.\n\nThe white balance of an image is the temperature of the light in the scene. If you want to achieve the vintage look, you'll need to set the white balance to the wrong temperature. This means that the light in the image will be either too warm or too cool, which will give it a more vintage feel.\n\n3. Use the wrong focus.\n\nThe focus of an image is the area that is in sharpest detail. If you want to achieve the vintage look, you'll need to set the focus to the wrong area. This means that the area that is in focus will be out of focus, which will give it a more vintage feel.",

The authors aim to create a framework for conducting optimization over all possible network sizes without the need for a costly global search and training of many networks from scratch. \n\nThe strengths of this paper include the development of a non-probabilistic framework for optimization, which allows for the elimination of redundant units and continuous addition of new units while training the network. The proposed optimization algorithm, AdaRad, is also a valuable contribution to the field of deep learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through a series of experiments with promising results.\n\nHowever, one of the potential weaknesses of this paper is the lack of comparison to existing methods that can achieve similar results.

The HLIRG sample is selected to have L(8-1000um)>10^12L_sun , where L(8-1000um), is derived by integrating over the best-fit SEDs for each source. We find that all sources are detected at >5 sigma significance in the 0.3-10 keV band; however only two objects show evidence for significant absorption above Galactic levels. For these two absorbed systems we derive column densities NH = 1.7 x 10^23 cm^{-2} and 2.1 x 10^22 cm^{-2} respectively. Using the hardness ratio HR=H-S/H+S, where H and S represent counts in the 3-7keV and 0.3-2keV bands respectively, we find no correlation between HR and either luminosity or redshift. This suggests that there may be little evolution in the intrinsic spectral shape of this population out to z=2.6.",
        "\n\nWe show that a class of half-BPS Wilson loops in four-dimensional gravity duals to finite temperature field theories have a structure which is related to the structure of the corresponding Wilson loops in the effective N=1 gauge theory. We show that the half-BPS Wilson loops are generated by a set of translation, rotation and an involution operator, which satisfy a set of relations which are analogous to the relations satisfied by the operators generating the BPS Wilson loops in the effective N=1 gauge theory. The only difference is that the half-BPS loops are not in general associated with a spinor field, but only with a \"shadow\" of the spinor field which is related to the spinor field by the constraint that the shadow is always anti-parallel to the spinor field. This shadow spinor field has a well defined structure only in the limit that the number of generations is large. In the N=1 gauge theory the same set of translation, rotation and involution operators generate also the BPS loops in the limit that the number of generations is large. We show that the half-BPS Wilson loops satisfy a set of non-trivial constraints which are related to the Poincaré symmetry and the Lorentz symmetry of the bulk theory.",

        "When Washington state was granted statehood in 1889, there indeed were debates about its name being similar to that of the nation's capital, Washington, DC. However, these debates did not center on the concern that the two names would be confused, but rather on the potential for confusion between the two governments.\n\nThere was worry that having two states with such similar names could create chaos in national correspondence and other official documents. To prevent this confusion, the original statehood bill proposed the name \"Tacoma\" for the state, as it was considered a good representative of the state's natural beauty and resources. However, public opinion ultimately favored the name \"Washington,\" as it honored the nation's first president, George Washington.\n\nDespite initial concerns, the state has developed its own distinct identity and is not often confused with the nation's capital. Washington state is known for its Pacific coastline, Cascade Mountains, and vibrant cities like Seattle and Spokane. Its economy is heavily dependent on industries such as technology, agriculture, and aerospace. With its own unique cultural landmarks and history, it is clear that Washington state has made a name for itself beyond any confusion with Washington, DC.",
        "In this paper, we explore the usage of nonlinear generalized functions in the Heisenberg-Pauli foundations of Quantum Field Theory. Our main motivation is to understand how these functions can help extend the applicability of Quantum Field Theory beyond the realm of perturbative quantum physics. We believe that this will provide a more complete picture of the underlying physical processes that govern the behavior of quantum particles at the subatomic level. \n\nOur approach involves the application of the theory of generalized functions, particularly in the context of the Dirac delta function, to nonlinear field equations. Through this, we were able to obtain new solutions that incorporate the effects of nonlinearity in the field. Furthermore, we have shown that nonlinear field equations can be understood in terms of an extended set of creation and annihilation operators, providing a novel way of interpreting the nonlinearity in terms of the underlying quantum mechanics. \n\nOur results demonstrate that nonlinear generalized functions are a powerful tool in exploring the fundamental properties of Quantum Field Theory and hint at the possibility of a broader application of nonlinearities in quantum physics. We expect that these findings will contribute to the ongoing efforts to develop a more complete and consistent framework of Quantum Field Theory.",

At the same time, a growing number of groups are applying deep learning to new applications.  Some of these groups are likely to be composed of inexperienced deep learning practitioners who are baffled by the dizzying array of architecture choices and therefore opt to use an older architecture (i.e., Alexnet).  Here we attempt to bridge this gap by mining the collective knowledge contained in recent deep learning research to discover underlying principles for designing neural network architectures.

        "Said set of questions can be divided into two categories; those that relate to the physiological aspects of human growth and those that relate to the psychological aspects of human growth. Physiologically, the human body experiences a reduction in levels of adenosine, which is a natural occurring energy system inhibitor. Adenosine levels in the body are typically high in between sets of exercise. Adenosine levels signal the body to reduce metabolic activity, which is needed for breakdown of muscle. Without energy needed for muscle contraction, muscle tension remains high. Additionally, since the human body is mostly comprised of water, the reduction in adenosine levels results in a natural decrease in body temperature, which further helps reduce muscle tension. Psychologically, human brains receive a signal to lower external motivation and increase internal motivation. The body is weary from exertion, and any additional exertion would be disproportionate to the external rewards typically received for lifting weights. However, as the human body rests, the body’s natural resources are rejuvenated and external motivation can be reduced. Internal motivation can remain high, as it is now derived from one’s own physiological needs rather than the expectations of others.",

        "\n\nHow to Grow Agave Plants\n\nAgave plants are known for their fleshy, spiky leaves and their thick, hairy roots. They are native to the hot, dry regions of the Americas and are now grown as ornamental plants in many other places.\n\nGrowing agave plants is relatively easy, as they are hardy and adaptable. They can thrive in dry, hot conditions, making them a good choice for desert or drought-prone gardens. They can also be grown in containers, which makes them a good choice for small spaces.\n\nWhen growing agave plants, it is important to give them enough space to grow. They can grow to be quite large, so it is best to plant them at least 10 feet away from other plants or structures.\n\nAgave plants are slow growers, so it can take several years for them to reach maturity. Once they have reached maturity, they will begin to produce flowers. The flowers are usually followed by fruit, which contains seeds that can be used to grow new agave plants.\n\nWhen caring for agave plants, it is important to provide them with plenty of sunlight and well-drained soil. They should be watered regularly, but be careful not to overwater them as this can cause their roots to rot.",

        "The George Kent Performance Hall is a multi-purpose arena on the campus of UCLA in Los Angeles, California, USA. The 3,006-seat hall was named in honor of billionairereal estate developer George Kent. The facility opened in 2016 and hosts UCLA Bruins basketball and other events. ddot! The George Kent Performance Hall is a 3,006-seat multi-purpose arena on the campus of UCLA in Los Angeles, California, USA. The hall was named in honor of billionaire real estate developer George Kent and was opened in 2016. The facility hosts UCLA Bruins basketball and other events. The arena has two levels and was designed by Gensler, a large architecture and design firm headquartered in Los Angeles. The hall is circular in shape, with a blue seat featuring the Bruin logo, embedded into a blue curved floor. The architect of the hall, Kazuyo Sejima of SANAA, said of the design, \"The circular shape can generate openness. We can see all the way to the other side.\" The building utilizes geothermal energy and has a green roof. The hall contains meeting and dining spaces, as well as a kitchen that is open to the arena. The arena hosts UCLA basketball games, as well as concerts, public events, and other sporting events. UCLA paid $189 million for the venue, the most expensive in the school's history. The facility replaced the Pauley Pavilion as the home of the Bruins basketball team and also serves as a meeting and convention center on campus. Seating capacity for basketball is 17,775, but the UCLA basketball team intends to lower the capacity to 15,000 to be more compatible with the smaller venues the team plays in outside of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournament. The arena has hosted two Final Fours, in 2022 and 2024. The hall is located on top of an open-air plaza that can be used in warm-weather months. The plaza is home to a farmer's market and other events during the spring, summer, and fall. The hall was involved in multiple controversies during its construction. The Bruin Club, which manages Bruin basketball games at the arena, initially sued the university in an effort to control costs associated with events there. It dropped the suit after reaching an agreement with the university, but some students criticized the university for the terms of the agreement. When the school accepted a donation from the educational foundation of entrepreneur Daniel X. Moloney to name the arena after himself, many students opposed the donation. Ultimately, Bruin fans protested, forcing the school to select another candidate, Kent, who is active with the school and local philanthropic efforts. The facility has been successful in its event bookings. UCLA has presold more than 1.5 million tickets for basketball events in the arena, making it the most popular venue on campus. The arena and plaza were designed to accommodate 25,000 people for concerts. The facility hosted the 2023 Americana Music Awards and the 2024 Billboard Music Awards. The facility hosted the finals of the 2019 NBA draft on June 7 and the 2020 NBA draft on June 19. The Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) also lease office space in the building, as does the UCLA men's and women's basketball teams. The Bruins men's and women's basketball teams also play some of their home games at the arena. The building was recognized by the American Institute of Architects with the Alvar Aalto Award for distinguished achievement in architecture. It won the 2018 Pollstar Sports & Music Awards Arena of the Year award, and it was a finalist for the 2019 Institutional Architect of the Year award.",

        "How to Thread Pipe'\n\nThreading pipes safely and effectively can be challenging, particularly for those with limited experience. With the proper tools and steps, however, anyone can successfully thread a pipe. Here's how to do it. \n\nFirst, purchase or rent a manual pipe threader machine from an equipment retailer. Then, inspect the pipe threader before beginning and replace any parts that show signs of wear. \n\nOnce you have your equipment ready, it is time to prepare the pipe. Mount your pipe firmly in a pipe vise by placing it in the vise and then tightening until it is held securely. Next, cut the end of the pipe cleanly and squarely using a pipe cutter. Then, use a reamer—a cylinder-shaped rotary cutting tool—to remove any burrs from the cut pipe.\n\nAfter prepping the pipe, the next step is to select your die head according to the size and type of pipe you are threading and the thread form you require. Then, place the die head over the pipe on the threader. Press steadily on the front of the die head, while simultaneously pushing the handle down to start the threading. It is important to use your weight as leverage to apply pressure on the handle, while holding it firmly. Additionally, you should apply threading oil generously while threading. \n\nOnce the end of the threading die is flat against the end of the pipe, stop threading. Then, reverse the ratchet mechanism and turn the die head in the opposite direction. Following that, stand the pipe on end and gently tap it to remove any particles that may be lodged within. \n\nClean the pipe with a cloth, removing any oil. When attaching the pipe to the connector, be sure to seal the threading with Teflon tape or a pipe thread compound. Finally, clean the pipe threader machine thoroughly after use so the oils and metal pieces do not damage the machine, which could cause sub-standard threading during your next project.\n\nFollowing these steps will help ensure that you thread pipes safely and successfully. With a little practice and patience, anyone can become a pro at pipe threading.",
        "\n\nWe consider a probabilistic model of a resource-constrained scheduled system, in which jobs arrive according to a Poisson process and have a random service demand. The scheduling policy is based on the concept of admissible scheduling, which was introduced by D.34 The system is adversarial: the scheduler wishes to minimize the variance of the sojourn time of the jobs subject to the constraint that the jobs do not wait too long. The analysis of the system reveals a connection with the probabilistic notion of anonymity, which was introduced by A.5 An anonymous process is one for which the distribution of the number of distinct elements in a sample is the same as the distribution of the number of distinct elements in the whole process. We show that a scheduler is admissible if and only if it preserves anonymity. We then show that any probabilistic scheduling policy that preserves anonymity has a deterministic equivalent that is admissible. As a by-product, we show that the deterministic restriction of an admissible probabilistic scheduling policy is itself admissible.",

        "Write a long abstract of a scientific paper from arXiv.org. Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Inflationary Perturbations: the Cosmological Schwinger Effect\".\nAbstract:\nWe show that inflationary perturbations are generated by quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field, which can be understood as the cosmological version of the Schwinger effect.  We also discuss how this mechanism is related to other proposals for generating primordial density fluctuations and present some new results on its phenomenology. The recent detection of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) has provided strong evidence for an early phase of accelerated expansion known as inflation [1] . In addition, it has been shown [2] that these observations are consistent with predictions based on slow-roll models [3] , where the energy density decreases slowly during inflation due to friction-like effects [4] .\nIn order to explain why such a period of rapid expansion occurred, one usually invokes a scalar field called \"inflaton\" whose potential V(φ) drives inflation when it becomes flat enough [5] . However, there exists no compelling theoretical reason for choosing any particular form for V(φ). For example, if we assume that V(φ) = m 2 φ 2 /2 + λφ 4 /4!, then the resulting dynamics will depend crucially on whether or not the mass term dominates over the quartic self-interaction [6] . This ambiguity leads us to consider more general forms for V(φ), including those containing higher-order terms [7, 8] .",
        "\n\nUsing a wristwatch as a randomizing device for game theory decisions is a simple and effective way to add an element of chance to your game play. This method can be used to generate random numbers for a variety of games, including Magic: The Gathering, poker, and board games.\n\nTo use a wristwatch as a randomizing device, you will need to have a watch with a second hand. The second hand should be clearly visible and easy to read. It's also important to make sure that the watch is accurate and that the second hand moves smoothly around the face of the watch.\n\nTo generate a random number, start by setting the watch to a specific time. This will be the starting point for your random number generator. Then, let the second hand move around the face of the watch for a few seconds to ensure that it is moving smoothly.\n\nOnce the second hand is moving smoothly, start counting the seconds from the starting point. Each second will correspond to a specific number on the face of the watch. For example, if the starting point is 12:00, each second will correspond to a number between 1 and 60.\n\nWhen you reach the desired number of seconds, stop counting and note the time on the watch. This will be your random number for that round of the game. Repeat this process as needed to generate additional random numbers.\n\nIt's important to note that this method of randomization is not perfect and may not be suitable for all games or situations. The watch may not be 100% accurate, and there may be slight variations in the speed of the second hand from one watch to another. Additionally, the watch may be affected by outside factors such as temperature or movement. It's a good idea to test the watch before using it to generate random numbers for a game, to ensure that it is functioning properly and that the results are truly random.",
        "In this paper, we evaluate and compare the performance of Langevin and Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) thermostats in a range of non-equilibrium simulations involving polymeric systems. We consider simulations to investigate polymer brushes in sliding motion, polymer liquids exposed to Poiseuille and Couette flows, and brush-melt interfaces with bead-spring models that are exposed to varying degrees of solvent quality. We will look at equilibrium, transient, and steady-state situations to assess the capacity of the two thermostats to maintain temperature conditions and to accurately reproduce physical phenomena in out-of-equilibrium conditions. Additionally, we answer the question of whether it is necessary or beneficial to discontinue the Langevin thermostat when running flow simulations. Finally, we provide a quantitative analysis of how various weight functions influence the efficiency of the DPD thermostat in terms of solvent quality and non-equilibrium states.",

Now it's time to create the actual feeders themselves!  First take apart any existing PVC elbows and straight connectors you'd like to use.  Then remove the ends of both pieces of PVC tubing.  You'll notice small metal rings attached to either side of the tube near its base.  These are called flanges and serve as attachment points for connecting the tubes together.  Remove those before continuing.      Take note of which way the flange faces - clockwise or counterclockwise.  If they're facing opposite directions, flip one over 180 degrees so they'll face the same direction.  Flip the other piece of PVC tubing over so that the flanges line up perfectly.  Press firmly onto the flanges while holding the PVC tubing steady against the tabletop.  Rotate the PVC tubing slowly back-and-forth several times until the connection feels tight enough to hold itself securely.  Finally screw down the nuts provided along the outside edge of the flanges.  Do this step carefully since the nut threads tend to strip easily.

        "Title: On the Expressive Power of Deep Neural Networks\n\nAuthors: John Doe and Jane Smith\n\nIn this paper, Doe and Smith investigate the expressive power of deep neural networks (DNNs), which have gained significant attention in the field of machine learning in recent years. The authors conduct an extensive testing and analysis of DNNs, comparing them to other models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs).\n\nThe paper is well-written and organized, with clear descriptions of the models and testing procedures used. The authors utilize a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets to thoroughly examine the capabilities of DNNs. Their results show that DNNs have higher accuracy and lower error rates compared to other models, indicating their superior expressive power.\n\nOne noteworthy limitation of the study is the lack of discussion on the interpretability of DNNs. While they may have strong predictive abilities, the black-box nature of DNNs can make it difficult to understand how they arrive at their conclusions. This is an important consideration for many real-world applications where transparency and interpretability are crucial.\n\nOverall, this paper provides valuable insights into the expressive power of DNNs and effectively demonstrates their utility in various contexts. The authors' thorough testing and analysis make a convincing case for the superiority of DNNs, although further research is necessary to fully understand their strengths and limitations.",

The results show that there is no correlation between these two parameters except for one star. We suggest that this may be due to different physical conditions among individual stars or differences in mass loss rates.  Keywords: Mira variable, Correlation, Infrared color, SiO maser line, Mass loss rate. 1 Introduction Miras are red giant stars which pulsate radially on time scales ranging from 100 days up to several thousand years. They exhibit large amplitude variations in luminosity as well as radial velocity. Their light curves can be described by a simple sinusoidal function with periods longer than about 300 days [1] . These stars are known to produce strong winds [2] , and they also emit intense radio waves [3] .\nThe SiO molecule has been found to exist in many types of astronomical objects such as late-type stars [4] , evolved massive stars [5] , young stellar objects [6] , comets [7] , and planets [8] . It is believed that SiO molecules play an important role in the formation process of dust grains [9] . SiO masers were first detected toward AGB stars [10] . Since then, SiO masers have been studied extensively towards both AGB stars [11] - [13] and post-AGB stars [14] - [16] . Many studies have shown that the properties of SiO masers depend strongly on the evolutionary stage [17] - [20] . For example, it was reported that the peak flux density decreases rapidly during the transition phase from AGB to post-AGB [21] .",

        "\n\nHow to Choose Hats for Your Face Shape\nChoosing the right hat can be daunting, especially if you don't know exactly what shape your face is. Face shapes can be divided into five different categories, oval, round, oblong, heart-shaped, and square. Here is how you can identify your face shape, as well as the best hats for each.\n\nTo determine your face shape, measure your forehead, cheekbones, jawline, and face-length and then take an honest look at yourself in the mirror. Ask yourself three questions: Is my face longer than it is wide? Is my face wider than it is long? Is my jawline wider than my forehead?\n\nOnce you have determined your face shape, you're ready to go shopping for hats. Here are the ideal shapes for each face shape:\n\nIf you have an oval face, the length of your face will be roughly one and half times greater than your face width. For this face shape, you can try all kinds of hats. Your face is symmetric, so you can pull off many shapes.\n\nIf you have a round face, it will be the same width and length, making oval and asymmetrical hats particularly flattering. A wide brimmed hat, like a sunhat or fedora, can help to elongate your face.\n\nFor an oblong face, which is longer than it is wide, wear a hat with a flared brim and low crown, such as a sunhat, a cloche, or a fedora. Try to avoid any overly structured hats as they will make your face look longer.\n\nIf you have a heart-shaped face, your face will be defined by wider cheekbones and a more narrow forehead and jawline. Go with a medium brimmed hat such as a fedora with a medium sized brim, a boater, a cloche, a homburg, a beanie, or a beret.\n\nFor square faces, look for hats with a more rounded shape like a pork pie hat or a floppy, wide brimmed hat. A hat shaped like a circle can help to add some softness to your face.\n\nFor those with a triangular face, characterized by a wide jawline, slightly smaller cheekbones, and smallest forehead, try a variety of hats. Feathers and wide brims can also add texture and create a look that is both stylish and flattering.\n\nWith these tips in mind, you have a better idea of the kinds of hats available to you depending on your face shape. Remember to take the time to find the best style for you, and don't let yourself be limited by just one or two styles. Have fun and experiment until you find the one that is right for you!",
        " Write a peer review by first describing what problem or question this paper addresses, then strengths and weaknesses, for the paper Learning Visual Servoing with Deep Features and Fitted Q-Iteration, its main content is as below: Visual servoing involves choosing actions that move a robot in response to observations from a camera, in order to reach a goal configuration in the world. Standard visual servoing approaches typically rely on manually designed features and analytical dynamics models, which limits their generalization capability and often requires extensive application-specific feature and model engineering. In this work, we study how learned visual features, learned predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning can be combined to learn visual servoing mechanisms. We focus on target following, with the goal of designing algorithms that can learn a visual servo using low amounts of data of the target in question, to enable quick adaptation to new targets. Our approach is based on servoing the camera in the space of learned visual features, rather than image pixels or manually-designed keypoints. We demonstrate that standard deep features, in our case taken from a model trained for object classification, can be used together with a bilinear predictive model to learn an effective visual servo that is robust to visual variation, changes in viewing angle and appearance, and occlusions. A key component of our approach is to use a sample-efficient fitted Q-iteration algorithm to learn which features are best suited for the task at hand. We show that we can learn an effective visual servo on a complex synthetic car following benchmark using just 20 training trajectory samples for reinforcement learning. We demonstrate substantial improvement over a conventional approach based on image pixels or hand-designed keypoints, and we show an improvement in sample-efficiency of more than two orders of magnitude over standard model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

Conclusion Thomas's yellow bat is an intriguing bat species, known for its distinctive appearance and impressive echolocation abilities. Despite being listed as near threatened, it remains under-studied and its conservation needs and requirements are not well understood. Further research is necessary to address this, and efforts must be made to protect its habitat and reduce human disturbances to ensure the survival of this unique species.",
        "The Page Fence Giants were a baseball team from the town of Adrian, Michigan. They played in a segregated league, the Negro Leagues, from 1895 to 1898. The team consisted of many of the best black players of that era, including Grant \"Home Run\" Johnson, Sol White, and Bud Fowler. The team was formed by a group of investors who owned the Page Woven Wire Fence Company, which was based in Adrian. The team was named after the company, and many of the players were employees of the company. The team played its games at Page's park, which was located near the company's headquarters. In their first season, the Page Fence Giants won the Michigan State Colored Baseball Championship. In 1896, they won the Western Interstate Colored Baseball Championship, which was a significant achievement at the time. The team then went on a national tour, playing against some of the top black teams in the country. One of the team's most memorable games was against the Cuban Giants in 1896. The Cuban Giants were considered one of the best black teams in the country at that time, but the Page Fence Giants defeated them 16-3. The game was seen as a major upset and helped to establish the Page Fence Giants as one of the best black teams in the nation. The team's success was short-lived, however. In 1898, the Page Fence Giants disbanded due to financial difficulties. Despite their brief existence, the team made a significant impact on the history of black baseball in America. Many of the players went on to play for other teams in the Negro Leagues, and the Page Fence Giants remain an important part of baseball history. Today, the Page Fence Giants are remembered and celebrated with a historical marker near their former baseball field in Adrian.",

        " Please write a peer review for the paper of Modularized Morphing of Neural Networks, its main content is as below: In this work we study the problem of network morphism, an effective learning scheme to morph a well-trained neural network to a new one with the network function completely preserved. Different from existing work where basic morphing types on the layer level were addressed, we target at the central problem of network morphism at a higher level, i.e., how a convolutional layer can be morphed into an arbitrary module of a neural network. To simplify the representation of a network, we abstract a module as a graph with blobs as vertices and convolutional layers as edges, based on which the morphing process is able to be formulated as a graph transformation problem. Two atomic morphing operations are introduced to compose the graphs, based on which modules are classified into two families, i.e., simple morphable modules and complex modules. We present practical morphing solutions for both of these two families, and prove that any reasonable module can be morphed from a single convolutional layer. Extensive experiments have been conducted based on the state-of-the-art ResNet on benchmark datasets, and the effectiveness of the proposed solution has been verified.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI have read the paper and I have some questions about the paper.\n\n\\strong{1.

        "In this work, we investigate the evolution of a neutral $K$ or $B$ meson from an incoherent to a coherent state, aiming to understand the fundamental properties of CP violation and the nature of arrows of time. The motivation for this research stems from the fact that the CP violation phenomenon, which refers to the violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation and parity, is one of the most intriguing puzzles in modern particle physics. Moreover, the arrow of time concept, which refers to the fact that physical processes are irreversible and always flow from the past to the future, is also a fundamental characteristic of our universe that remains mostly unexplained.\n\nTo tackle these complex concepts, we employ a quantum mechanical framework that uses time-dependent Schrödinger equations to model meson evolution. We then analyze the resulting oscillations and compare with experimental data to extract valuable insights into the physics at play. Our methodology is based on extensive numerical simulations and statistical analysis to obtain robust results that can shed light on the nature of time and CP violation.\n\nOverall, our work contributes to the ongoing effort to unravel some of the mysteries of particle physics and the fundamental properties of the universe, providing a solid foundation for future research into these intriguing phenomena.",
        "In this work, we consider a multiple-antenna fading channel with a quantized precoding matrix. The transmitter uses linear precoding to send signals to a receiver with multiple antennas. To illustrate the capacity of this channel, we first consider the non-precoding case and characterize the capacity with the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR), where the quantization is imposed at both the transmitter and the receiver. We then consider the case with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding and characterize the capacity for two different scenarios: when the SQNR is large, i.e., with high-precision quantization; and when the SQNR is small, i.e., with low-precision quantization. Through numerical results, we show that both the non-precoding and ZF precoding cases achieve similar performance for high SQNR, but that precoding can significantly increase the capacity for low SQNR.",
        "Well, I don't know much about archeology, but I sure do love Indiana Jones! He's really cool and he finds all kinds of neat treasure. But sometimes he does things that seem kind of dangerous or not too smart. Like when he takes the golden idol in the temple and it sets off a bunch of traps. Or when he goes into the tomb with all the snakes and almost gets bitten. \n\nI asked my dad, who knows more about archeology than I do, and he said that Indiana Jones isn't always a good archeologist. He takes a lot of risks and doesn't always follow proper techniques. And he's always after treasure, which isn't really what archeology is about.

        "Crop circles have been a topic of fascination for many people around the world. These mysterious formations that appear overnight in crop fields have puzzled scientists and enthusiasts alike. If you share the curiosity of visiting a crop circle and want to experience it firsthand, continue reading this guide to learn how to do it.\n\nPart 1 - Understanding Crop Circles\nBefore you visit a crop circle formation, it's essential to understand what they are. Crop circles are geometric patterns that appear in fields of crops, usually in the middle of the night. These formations can range from simple circles to complex designs that span hundreds of feet. Theories about the origin of crop circles vary, with some believing that they are made by extraterrestrial beings, while others attribute them to human-made art installations.\n\nPart 2 - Distinguishing between Crop Formations\nCrop circles can be classified into three broad categories: Melik circles, which are simple formations with circles and rings; Pictograms, which are more complex designs that resemble pictorial representations; and Fractals or other very intricate and ornate geometric constructs. Familiarizing yourself with these categories can help you appreciate the details and intricacies of each crop formation better.\n\nPart 3 - Capturing the Best Photos\nWhen visiting a crop circle, try to be the first to set foot on the scene. If possible, get to high ground to capture an aerial view of the entire design. This is also an excellent opportunity to take good photographs or footage of the crop circle. Bring a camera with a high-resolution setting and a telephoto lens to capture both wide and detailed shots of the formation.\n\nPart 4 - Bringing the Right Equipment\nWhen visiting a crop circle, it's essential to bring the right equipment. First, wear comfortable clothing and sturdy shoes to navigate through fields of crops easily. It's also advisable to bring a pair of gloves and a hat to protect yourself from the sun's heat. Additionally, if you want to take measurements of the crop circle, consider bringing a measuring tape and other surveying tools.\n\nPart 5 - Testing for Radioactivity\nSome people believe that crop circles are linked to increased levels of radiation. It's helpful to bring a Geiger counter or a radiation intensity meter to check for any radioactive activity. Learn to distinguish between radioactivity and microwave radiation, and avoid exposure to gamma rays, which can be harmful to your health. It's also useful to take along a portable radio frequency spectrum analyzer to detect and measure any lingering microwave energy within the crop circle.\n\nPart 6 - Respecting the Crop Circle\nWhen visiting a crop circle, it's crucial to respect the crop and surrounding environment. Do not trample or damage any crops while walking through the formation. Also, remember that crop circles often appear on private property, so obtain permission before visiting. Lastly, leaving the area as you found it ensures that others can appreciate the crop circle in its natural state.\n\nIn conclusion, visiting a crop circle can be a fascinating and enlightening experience. Understanding these formations, bringing the proper equipment, and respecting the environment is essential to getting the most out of the experience. Just remember to keep an open mind and enjoy the mystery of these unique phenomena.",

        "The planet HD 155358 b is the lowest-metallicity planet found to date, with a mass 12.6 times that of Earth and a radius that is 0.68 times that of Earth. This super-Earth with inflated radius likely has a high proportion of desert planets without water. Due to the strong radial velocity signature of a massive planet, coupled with a sensitive Doppler survey, the system was identified as a promising target for the CARMENES instrument. When first observed, the planet was 3.5 hours behind its star, taking 47 days to move ahead by one full star diameter. The slow motion together with the very low metallicity of the star, which is 12.5% of the Sun's, suggests that the planet formed at greater distance from the parent star and migrated inward via torques induced by the star's gravity. If this scenario is true, the time required for the planet to move from its birth place to its current orbit is expected to be 1.5 million years, which is comparable to the estimated age of the system. This planet provides a valuable opportunity to investigate the frequency of Earth-like planets around low-metallicity stars and to test theories of planet migration.",
        "Our work focuses on ground-based microlensing surveys and aims to contribute to the ongoing effort to unlock the mysteries of the universe. The motivation for our research derives from the fact that microlensing surveys represent one of the most promising tools for discovering the presence of dark matter, detecting exoplanets, and studying the structure and dynamics of our galaxy.\n\nThe key idea behind our work is to use advanced ground-based telescopes to conduct microlensing surveys that can provide important insights into the distribution and properties of dark matter and the abundance of exoplanets. Our methodology is based on the use of statistical models to analyze and interpret large amounts of observational data obtained from microlensing surveys.\n\nThe main problem that our work attempts to solve is the need to develop reliable and accurate methods for identifying and characterizing microlensing events. By doing so, we aim to advance our understanding of the composition of the universe, shed light on the nature of dark matter, and contribute to the search for life beyond our solar system.\n\nIn summary, our work on ground-based microlensing surveys seeks to make important contributions to the field of astronomy and astrophysics by providing new insights into fundamental questions about our universe.",

        "Whoa, Sir Ian McKellen is gay? That's cool! Um, sorry, I mean, that's surprising! I don't really know who he is, but I guess he's a famous actor or something. Anyway, so you're asking what people thought when he came out on the radio 30 years ago? Well, I wasn't even born yet, but I think it was probably a big deal back then.\n\nFrom what I've heard, being gay was not as accepted back then as it is now. Some people thought it was wrong or weird or gross. But other people were supportive and said it was okay to love whoever you want. It probably depended on where you lived and what your family and friends thought.\n\nIn the UK, where Sir Ian is from, I think people were mostly okay with it. He's a really good actor and people liked him, so they didn't really care if he was gay or not. But in the US, where I live, it might have been more of a shock. Some people in America can be really mean to gay people even today, so I can imagine it was even worse back then.\n\nOverall, I think coming out as gay on the radio was a really brave thing for Sir Ian to do. It probably helped other gay people feel more comfortable being themselves too.",

        "We have conducted a deep search for the progenitor of the Type Ic Supernova 2002ap by employing pre-explosion observations from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Aligning high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope observations of the supernova with the archival CFHT images enabled us to identify the location of the progenitor site on the ground-based observations. We were able to conclude that an observed source close to the SN position was not the progenitor, due to its visibility post-explosion, with late-time observations taken with the William Herschel Telescope. Comparisons to stellar models indicate that any single star progenitor could have experienced at least twice the standard mass loss rate during pre-Wolf-Rayet evolution, been initially more massive than 30-40 solar masses, and exploded as a Wolf-Rayet star with a final mass of 10-12 solar masses. Also possible is a scenario of an initially less massive progenitor, but in an interacting binary system. We have deduced that any possible binary companion would be a main-sequence star of less than 20 solar masses, a neutron star, or a black hole. By combining limits from pre-explosion obvervations, ejecta mass estimates and constraints from X-ray and radio observations, we have concluded that any binary interaction most likely happened during a Case B mass transfer, with or without a subsequent common envelope evolution phase.",

They can also help prevent diaper rashes in some cases.   If you notice any signs that your child may have developed a diaper rash (redness around their genitals), apply diaper cream immediately before putting them back into their diaper.    You should always use diaper cream even though there isn't visible redness because it will still provide protection against moisture and friction which could cause problems later down the road.     The most common ingredients found in diaper creams include zinc oxide, lanolin, dimethicone, petrolatum, mineral oil, aloe vera gel, chamomile extract, vitamin E, calendula flower extract, oatmeal powder, shea butter, glycerin, and other natural moisturizers such as coconut oil and olive oil.    There... are many types of diaper creams available today ranging from basic unscented formulas made primarily out of zinc oxide to more expensive varieties containing additional active ingredients like calamine lotion, witch hazel, tea tree oil, and others.  Some parents prefer using plain old vaseline over diaper creams since it's less messy but this product does little to actually treat existing diaper rashes and won't keep your baby's bottom soft either....",
        "Netball in Africa is played across the continent, with the Confederation of African Netball Association (CANA) being the governing body. The game was started before the European colonization of Africa and is believed to have originated in English-speaking countries such as Britain, Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia. There are three main forms of the game played in Africa - traditional, commercialized and professional. Traditional form of the game is played in most countries in North Africa, while commercialized form is dominant in East Africa (especially in Kenya and Uganda). Professional form of the game is the most popular in Southern Africa (Botswana, South Africa and Zambia), with a significant following in Western Africa (especially Nigeria, Ghana and Benin). Other countries are starting to embrace netball, with Mali launching a national team for the first time in 2023 and Botswana hosting a Global Division 2 tournament for the first time in 2023. The sport is also making in-roads into schools with Ghana funding 50 schools to play with the Ghana Netball Association, with similar programs in Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia. While netball remains the third most popular sport in Africa only behind football and cricket, its growth is surprising considering that it only started five decades ago. A number of reasons have been suggested for this, including the establishment of dedicated and powerful federations, greater use of social media and the adaptation of the sport to local conditions and styles.",

        " Lietava (Neris) is a small village in Šakiai district municipality located in northern Lithuania, at the intersection of the main Četegiris-Šakiai road and Dovainonys-Rastoniai road. It has a population of approximately 406 people. The name of the village first appeared in written documents sometime in the 18th century. Initially, it was called “Šakių Girdinių Meilandas”. Later it changed to “Lietava” as its current name. Its name translates to “wet land” in Lithuanian, as the neighborhood is mostly wetland and swamp. Most of the people of Lietava are engaged in farming. They grow various types of crops, such as potatoes and grain, as well as raising animals such as pigs, cows and chickens. In 2003, the village decided to make a construction project to improve the condition of its streets. An asphalt road was built from Četegiris to Šakiai, which covers the entire distance from Lietava up to the Šakiai boundary. Lietava also provides a number of services to the nearby villages. It has several retail stores that offer basic items, as well as a barbershop and a small restaurant. There is also a post office and a library in the village, which enables people to keep in touch with their relatives and access the latest news. The village also has a small church, which is used mainly by the inhabitants of Lietava and the surrounding region. The celebration of the Catholic Easter is very important to the people of Lietava, as it is a sign of the new year's resurrection and the difficulties of the preceding year. Lietava is a small but vibrant village, full of life and culture. Despite the simple facilities, it has become a wonderful place to raise a family.

        "The Norma Cluster (ACO 3627), also known as the Norma Cluster complex or the Norma Cluster System, is a concentration of galaxies in the Local Universe related to the prominent nearby supercluster. Norma resides near the center of the Local Supercluster, located at a distance of 100 million light-years from Earth, and it is one of the most massive nearby clusters of galaxies with a mean mass-to-light ratio of 800 h–( Human unit of mass ) in solar units. The cluster comprises several distinct subclumps with cool gas and dust, as shown by the Herschel Space Observatory, and it is estimated to contain a total of at least 10 times as many galaxies as do the Leo Cluster and the Virgo Cluster combined. The Norma Cluster is not only the most massive concentration of galaxies in the Local Universe, but it is also the most concentrated cluster on thescale of the entire local universe. The Norma Cluster as viewed in the red band of the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. The dynamical state of clusters and their individual components can be constrained using the product of space density and velocity dispersion, called the mass-to-light ratio. Using an accurate measurement of the velocities of member galaxies, we have determined the mass-to-light ratio for the Norma Cluster. We find a value of 800 h–, making it the most massive known structure in the local universe. The mass distribution of the Norma Cluster, as derived from our measurement of the velocity dispersion, follows anNFW profile, with a best-fit values for the concentration parameter of c=6.1. Norma is among the most concentrated clusters known and it has one of the highest measured mass-to-light ratios; both of these are direct indications of its dynamically young state. The dynamical state of the Norma Cluster suggests that it is in the process of rapid formation, and will end up as one of the most massive galaxy clusters seen in the local universe. The mass distribution of Norma is consistent with a recent major merger, with a mass ratio of at least 2:1 between the two main clumps. The most recent major merger event for Norma likely occurred 1.2 billion years ago, as derived from the relative ages of the two main clumps, and this merger gave rise to a rapid rise in its velocity dispersion by pushing the members away from their initial positions.",

        "In this paper and its companion (Paper II), we provide evidence and analysis of how gravitational lensing-induced magnification can anisotropically distort the 3D correlation and power spectrum of galaxies and quasars. We show that on scales of ~100 Mpc/h, there is preferential enhancement of the observed correlation along the line-of-sight (LOS) orientation, which can reach up to a factor of a few at a redshift of z ~ 0.35, even when the intrinsic correlations are weak. We also reveal that this anisotropic distortion can be distinguishable from the standard distortion from peculiar motions regime. Such magnification must be taken into account when interpreting upcoming data with greater precision, as shifts in the inferred parameters, such as the Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance, can be biased by up to ~3% along the LOS and ~0.6% in the monopole, depending on the redshift, bias and number counts slope. Finally, this magnification distortion may provide an explanation for enhanced correlations seen in pencil beam surveys.",
        "We present our findings on IIB backgrounds with five-form flux, which have important implications for string theory and its compactifications. Our work provides a deeper understanding of the structure of the five-form flux and its impact on the geometry and physics of these backgrounds.\n\nAt the core of our research is the identification of a new class of solutions that exhibit supersymmetry and are supported by the five-form flux. We find that these backgrounds have non-vanishing flux and satisfy the conditions required for a non-trivial background geometry to be consistent with supergravity. In particular, we observe that the geometry of the backgrounds is characterized by a singular metric that is, however, regular in the near-horizon limit.\n\nOur work addresses a fundamental problem in the study of IIB backgrounds with flux, namely the lack of a complete understanding of their properties and their significance in the context of string theory. By providing a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of these backgrounds, we aim to fill this gap and contribute to the ongoing efforts to develop a more complete and unified theory of string theory.\n\nOur investigation combines a range of analytical and numerical techniques, including the use of differential geometry, algebraic topology, and computer simulations. We employ a variety of mathematical tools and concepts, such as the study of moduli spaces and the analysis of spectral properties, to derive and validate our results.\n\nOverall, we provide important insight into the structure and properties of IIB backgrounds with five-form flux, which have important implications for the understanding of string theory and the nature of the universe.",

        "The multiverse theory attempts to prove the existence of all possible universes and their bounds. The theory was proposed by Stephen Hawking, and states that there are an infinite number of universes bound by natural laws that are the same in all respects. This theory attempts to answer why we are not living in the “best” universe, and why we do not know of any other lifeforms. The multiverse theory was proposed as a solution to the \"fine-tuning problem\" – how a universe can emerge from laws of physics that seem designed to give rise to life. In order for a universe to contain all the ingredients for life, the laws of physics would need to be extremely specific and differ from universe to universe. Therefore, according to this theory, there are an infinite number of different universes, each with its own set of physical laws, and it is quite likely that one of these laws produces universes that are “best” candidates for life.",

        "Puncturing is a simple technique to improve the performance of turbo coding. It has been known for a long time that one can construct a simple systematic single parity check (SPCH) code that can approach the Shannon limit. However, constructing good random puncturing patterns is a difficult problem. In this paper, a pseudo-random puncturing pattern is proposed. The performance of turbo coding with this pattern is compared to conventional turbo coding with fixed puncturing patterns. It is shown that the new puncturing pattern significantly reduces the error floor without causing any noticeable performance degradation. This work was done at ETRI. Reference: 1. A. G. i. A.

Issai had five siblings, all of whom became notable mathematicians in their own rights. His sister Gornella was the first female mathematician to receive a PhD in Europe. Another sister, Hilda, also studied mathematics and became a renowned algebraic geometer. His other sisters Sara, and Ida, were the first female students to enroll at the ETH in Zurich, Switzerland. Issai was himself a PhD student of Hermann Schwarz and an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1928 in Bologna, Italy. He made significant contributions to the theory of partial differential equations, operator theory and function theory. In partial differential equations, he introduced the now-standard Schur complement. In operator theory, he introduced the notion of normal cone, an idea that he then extended to function spaces. Finally, in function theory, he introduced two characterizations of the Laplace operator that are known today as the Cauchy integral formula and the residue theorem.",
        "\n\nWe extend the concept of coherence to pairs of multivariate time series. We show that a simple extension of the conventional definition of coherence allows one to characterize the dynamics of phase synchronization in such pairs. In particular, we find that a large number of common features previously identified on the basis of coherence can be understood in terms of the properties of this generalized measure. At the same time, our results reveal a number of new features that have not been identified before. As an application, we show that this generalized coherence can be used to remove the zero-lag contribution to synchronization, thereby revealing the underlying dynamical structure in a more direct way. In particular, we show that this procedure can be used to extract additive noise components from the original time series, provided that they are uncorrelated with the rest of the dynamics. This has important implications for the study of complex systems, since it provides a way to remove synchronization due to external driving and to focus on the internally generated dynamics.",
        "Kaleidoscope is a 1966 British thriller film directed by Jack Smight and starring Warren Beatty and Susannah York. The film features a cat-and-mouse game between a playboy thief and a Scotland Yard detective. Beatty plays Barney Lincoln, a charming jewel thief who is released from prison and immediately resumes his life of crime. His latest target is the vault at the high-end London department store Beaumont's, which he plans to rob alongside his accomplice, a fashion model named Angel (played by York). Meanwhile, Inspector Meredith (played by Clive Revill) of Scotland Yard is on the hunt for Barney, determined to catch him and put an end to his criminal activities. Meredith employs a range of tactics, including surveillance and planting false information, to try to catch Barney in the act. The film is notable for its stylish direction, which includes frequent use of split-screen and other innovative visual techniques. The score, composed by Johnny Mandel, also received critical acclaim and was nominated for an Academy Award. Kaleidoscope was released to generally positive reviews from critics upon its release, with many praising the performances of Beatty and York, as well as the film's intricate plot and stylish visuals. Some critics, however, found the film to be overly convoluted and unnecessarily complicated. Despite its mixed critical reception, Kaleidoscope has since gained a cult following and is remembered as a stylish and entertaining thriller from the 1960s. The film was produced by United Artists and has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray.",

        "There are several reasons explaining why Qatar has faced criticisms over its hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. While the country is the first from the Middle East to host the event, many have raised concerns about the practicalities and ethics behind the decision.\n\nOne of the most prominent issues is related to the climate in Qatar. The nation's summers can be extremely hot, with temperatures often climbing above 40°C, which can make working and playing outside difficult. This has led to concerns for the safety and health of the players and fans. To address this, Qatar has proposed a plan to air-condition stadiums, but there is much skepticism regarding its feasibility, cost, and environmental impact.\n\nMoreover, some criticize Qatar's human rights record, particularly in relation to the rights of migrant workers who are being employed for the construction of stadiums and infrastructure for the World Cup. Reports have suggested that workers are subjected to poor working conditions, exploitation, and human rights violations.\n\nAnother issue related to the hosting of the World Cup in Qatar is the country's limited football culture and infrastructure. Qatar is not known for its football tradition, having never qualified for a major tournament before. This has led to concerns about the quality of the tournament and the impact it could have on fans and the game itself.\n\nLastly, the decision to award the World Cup to Qatar has been shrouded in allegations of corruption and bribery. FIFA has faced significant criticism for the secretive and opaque nature of its decision-making, with allegations of vote-buying and other irregularities.\n\nIn conclusion, Qatar's hosting of the World Cup has faced a range of criticisms, including concerns related to the impracticalities of the climate, human rights violations, limited football culture, and allegations of corruption and bribery. While it remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, it is clear that the decision to award the tournament to Qatar continues to be a controversial one.",

We find that the soft excess emission is well described by a blackbody component with kT = 0.16 keV and luminosity LBB ~ 1043 erg s-1. The hard X-ray spectrum can be fitted either by a power law or Compton reflection model. In both cases we detect strong relativistic Fe Kα lines at 6.4-6.7 keV which are broadened to FWHM ~ 1000 km/sec. These results suggest that there may exist two distinct regions where the accretion disk interacts with the central supermassive black hole.

        "In this work, we investigate the space velocities of 10 southern globular clusters in the low galactic latitude region. Previous studies of globular clusters focused on the high galactic latitude region, but understanding the dynamics of clusters in the low latitude region is essential to accurately model the overall motion of the Milky Way. Our aim is to determine the three-dimensional velocities of the clusters using radial velocities and proper motions taken from the literature. Additionally, we measure distances to the clusters using the infrared magnitude of the horizontal branch method. Our results show that the clusters in the low galactic latitude region have a higher velocity dispersion in the vertical direction compared to the clusters in the high galactic latitude region. This suggests that the low latitude clusters may be more susceptible to tidal disruption by the Galactic disk. Furthermore, we find evidence for significant rotation in the clusters, with a possible trend towards prograde rotation for clusters with smaller Galactocentric distances. Our study highlights the importance of studying clusters in the low galactic latitude region to further our understanding of the Milky Way’s formation and evolution.",

        "The period preceding the American Revolution was marked by the emergence of a vibrant culture of pamphlet literature. Pamphlets were a popular medium for disseminating political and ideological views, and were read widely by both men and women. Scholars assert that pamphlets played an essential role in shaping public opinion and mobilizing support for the revolutionary cause. \n\nWomen in the American colonies actively participated in the political discourse of the time, and reading pamphlets was a crucial part of their engagement. While there is little data on the reading habits of women during this time, there are numerous references to women reading pamphlets in personal diaries, letters, and memoirs. For example, Abigail Adams, wife of John Adams, was a notable correspondent and avid reader of political pamphlets. In her letters, she frequently discussed the ideas put forth in such pamphlets and exchanged views with her correspondents. Moreover, Mercy Otis Warren, a prominent writer and intellectual of the time, wrote and published political pamphlets that were widely read by both men and women. \n\nThe language and tone of pamphlets were often targeted at a wide readership, including women, thus making them accessible to a broad audience. For example, Thomas Paine's Common Sense, which Angelica Schuyler references in the song, was a bestseller and was widely read by both men and women. Its clear and direct language, combined with its radical message, made it a popular and influential work. Women's engagement with pamphlet literature demonstrates that their participation in political discussions and debates was not only encouraged but also recognized and respected.  \n\nIn conclusion, women were not only reading pamphlets like Common Sense in the years leading up to the American Revolution, but their active participation in political discourse played an essential role in shaping the political ideology of the time. While we may not have complete data on women's reading habits, their participation is evident in personal writings and the dissemination of their own work, such as that of Mercy Otis Warren. The cultural and social climate of the time made it possible for women to engage with political ideas and contribute to the revolutionary cause.",
        "Yes, a cure for tinnitus is actively being worked on. Several research teams throughout the world are conducting studies and testing out new treatments and medications to try and find a solution to tinnitus. \n\nOne of the most promising treatments currently being researched is called acoustic coordinated reset (CR) therapy. This is a treatment that uses low-level sound and vibration to stimulate involved neurons in the cochlea, the auditory nerve and the auditory cortex. It is believed that this can help to improve the symptoms of tinnitus. \n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation or TMS is another potential treatment that has been found to reduce tinnitus symptoms. This is when magnetic pulses are used to stimulate the brain. The pulses influence the neurons to reset in order to potentially help with tinnitus.\n\nVagus nerve stimulation is also being studied. It is believed that the auditory cortex participates in the experience of tinnitus, meaning stimulating the vagus nerve could help to reduce symptoms. \n\nAnother promising area in research is creating an artificial auditory pathway. This would use other non-auditory systems to stimulate the auditory cortex and potentially help to reduce the sensation of tinnitus. \n\nSo far these treatments are in their research stages and it still is unknown if and how much relief they could bring to people suffering from tinnitus. Research is going on to find a definite cure for tinnitus, but no definitive evidence has been found yet.",
        "\n\nGamma-ray albedo of the moon\n\nWe present the first precise measurement of the moon's gamma-ray albedo, a key parameter needed to determine the lunar surface's radioactivity. The measurement was made possible by a new high-purity germanium detector, which we used to collect 2.6 ks of exposure data with the Nadir instrument on the International Space Station. The measured albedo is 1.88 ± 0.07 h Fallout-Uranium, in agreement with model predictions. We found that the surface radioactivity increases with increasing altitude and then decreases rapidly with depth, consistent with a simple model in which the radioactivity is produced by alpha-decay of oxygen and silicon in the lunar regolith. We also found that the concentration of radioactive potassium is higher in high- altitude areas, which is consistent with volcanic outgassing. Our results imply that the average lunar surface particle is 2.4% less radioactive than the Earth's average meteorite, which contains 1.5% uranium. We discuss the implications of our results for radioactivity and the production of lunar crater ejecta.",
        "The concept of the Soviet Deep Battle theory emerged during the interwar period, when the Soviet Union began to develop its military applications in order to protect and preserve its newly-won control over the country. Deep Battle was initially a strategic concept that revolved around the idea of a two-pronged attack: one strike at the enemy position upon the battlefield and one of deep penetration and exploitation of the enemy's rear. This attack was meant to pass through and beyond the enemy's defenses and act as a spearhead that would disrupt their command and control networks and supply lines, ultimately putting the enemy on the defensive and crippling their capacity to resist.\n\nThe idea of Deep Battle was heavily influential in Soviet war planning during World War II and served as a primary guideline for the operations of the Red Army during that time. The theory desired that a deep penetration attack would be conducted far behind the enemy lines, utilizing the fast speed of mechanized forces and airpower units to cut supply lines and disrupt enemy communications, thereby allowing the attacking forces to strike at the heart of the enemy's operational command and control centers.\n\nDespite the centrality of Deep Battle in the Red Army's war planning during World War II, the theory of Deep Battle was often divorced from the actual practice of it. The theory had stipulated that the Red Army was to make use of a standard two-pronged attack: a deep penetration of the enemy's rear and a fast, powerful attack at the enemy's defenses on the battlefield. However, in practice, the Red Army instead opted to rely predominantly on their massive numerical strength to outflank and envelop the enemy in continuous deep raids, concentrating all of their efforts into taking ground rather than completely bypassing the enemy as the theory had recommended. This approach eventually led to huge losses in manpower, as the front was often filled with casualties.\n\nThe differences between the theory and practice of the Soviet Deep Battle strategy is illustrative of the difficulties posed in truly understanding the limitations of a strategic concept as well as the improvized complexities of command and control systems on the battlefield. While the theory provided a useful framework for understanding the dynamics of modern warfare, the real-world practice of the Red Army was often at odds with the idealized expectations described in the theoretical conception of Deep Battle.",
        "The golden ratio is a number that's used to describe certain shapes or arrangements. It's been used in mathematics, architecture, and nature too! It's a special number that helps us to understand the structure of things. In nature, it's found in flower petals and leaves and is used to describe how things grow. \n\nFor example, when a leaf is growing from a stem, it grows in a way that has a special ratio which follows the golden ratio. This means that each leaf is positioned in relation to the other leaves and each leaf has a set size. But that's not all. The golden ratio is also seen in how trees sprout buds, how petals lay inside a flower, and even how plants branch out from the main stem. \n\nThe golden ratio is also special in other ways. In a circle, it can be used to define its diameter and area. And it's also often seen in spiral shapes because its ratio can easily be used to create a wedge shape or spiral-like designs.\n\nBasically, the golden ratio is like nature's blueprint. It's sort of like a secret code that makes things grow the right way. The code is universal, meaning it's the same code that plants, animals, and other creatures use to build the shapes they need. It's the same code that trees use to grow the right amount of leaves and petals, and that animals use to create their fur pattern or stripes. \n\nSo, the golden ratio is like a mathematical key to nature, because without it, things wouldn't know how to grow the way they do. It's like nature's language and it's unbelievably cool!",
        "The smallest yield possible of a nuke is commonly referred to as a \"tactical\" or \"low-yield\" nuclear weapon. These types of weapons typically have a yield of less than 20 kilotons, which is much lower than the yields of the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.\n\nLow-yield nuclear weapons are designed for use in specific military situations, such as targeting enemy troops, military installations, or even underground bunkers. They are generally considered to be less destructive than their higher-yield counterparts, but can still cause significant damage and radiation effects.\n\nOne example of a low-yield nuclear weapon is the W76 warhead, which is used on submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in the US nuclear arsenal. This warhead has a yield of less than 10 kilotons and is designed to be used in a variety of military scenarios.\n\nWhile low-yield nuclear weapons can be tempting to use for their supposed tactical advantages, there are also significant risks involved. The use of even a small nuclear weapon could escalate into a larger conflict, potentially causing catastrophic damage and loss of life.\n\nOverall, the smallest yield possible of a nuke is a complex topic that involves both military strategy and ethical considerations. It is important for global leaders to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of such weapons before making any decisions about their deployment or use.",
        "The paper \"Training Agent for First-Person Shooter Game with Actor-Critic Curriculum Learning\" addresses the issue of improving the performance of AI agents in First-Person Shooter games through actor-critic curriculum learning. The authors propose a new framework to train and evaluate the performance of AI agents in the Doom environment using the actor-critic approach.\n\nThe paper has several strengths. Firstly, the authors successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The performance of the AI agent is improved significantly using the actor-critic curriculum learning approach. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other existing methods in the Doom game environment. Secondly, the paper provides detailed information about the methodology and experimental setup. The thorough experimental analysis allows for replication and validation of the results.\n\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. Firstly, the paper lacks clarity in some parts, causing difficulty in understanding the methodology. For example, the authors do not explain the reason for using a specific set of parameters in the experiments adequately. This vagueness makes it harder to reproduce the methodology. Secondly, the paper does not consider the applicability of the proposed framework in other game environments. Given that different games may have different requirements and complexities, it is crucial to determine the transferability of the framework across other game environments.\n\nOverall, the paper provides a solid foundation for improving the performance of AI agents in First-Person Shooter games. The strengths of the paper make it a valuable contribution to the field, while the weaknesses highlight areas that require further investigation and clarification.",
        "Synthesis of Taylor phase screens is an important problem in many applications of linear systems theory and adaptive signal processing. In this Letter, we present a method for the synthesis of Taylor phase screens based on Karhunen-Loeve (KL) basis functions. The approach combines ideas from optimisation and compensation. It consists of an optimisation problem that is non-convex and hard to solve in general, but can be approximated efficiently using an alternating method. The algorithm is validated on the synthesis of polynomial screens and an exponential screen. The synthesis of Taylor screens is a harder problem than synthesis of polynomial screens since it requires the synthesis of screens with rapidly changing phases. However, the proposed method synthesises Taylor screens with arbitrary smoothness and satisfies a natural physical constraint which guarantees the phase changes gradually. Balancing multiple objectives is a difficult problem in general. This is reflected by the fact that most heuristics for the synthesis of Taylor screens converge to a local optimum rather than the global optimum. In this Letter, we demonstrate how to tackle this problem using the KL method. We present a two-step method for initialisation and parameter identification. We show that the identified screens satisfy the physical constraints and have good approximation properties. We also propose a multi-start strategy that starts multiple algorithms for the synthesis of screens and combines the results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on two design examples and compare it with state of the art algorithms.",

        "\n\nThe multiple viewpoints as approach to information retrieval within collaborative development context. \n\nWe are motivated by the observation that software development, due to its nature, has to deal with a huge amount of information of highly diverse nature. The information may be located in different places, in various forms and representations, and related to very different contexts. For example, requirements for a new product may be gathered from customers by marketing people, while development team gets requirements from product management and tries to make sense of them in the context of existing products and their limitations. At the same time, development team has to deal with technical documentation produced by the vendors of the used technologies, with the requests from the product management to adjust the product to the changing market, with the problems encountered during the development and with the need to document the product for the future maintenance. We observe that such diversity and amount of information require special approach to its retrieval, management and storage. We claim that the collaborative development context brings new requirements and challenges to the information retrieval process and suggest a new approach, which is based on the multiple viewpoints concept, to solve the information retrieval and management problems within collaborative development context.\n\nThe proposed approach is based on the assumption that the information about the same object can be represented from different viewpoints, and the information retrieval effectiveness can be improved by using the multiple representations. In order to prove this assumption we consider the example of requirements information management. We describe the architecture of the proposed approach and present the results of its evaluation.",
        "The term \"Proof\" refers to how much sugar was added during distillation, while ABV (alcohol-by-volume) indicates what percentage of pure ethanol remains after water has been removed from wine or spirits.  Proof also describes how strong an alcoholic beverage tastes compared with other similar products.   The higher the proof number, the stronger the taste will be.    For example,  80-proof liquor may have twice as many calories per serving than 40-proof liquor because it's more concentrated.     In addition,   some states require that all liquors sold at retailers must contain no less than 40% ABV; however, there are exceptions where lower percentages can still qualify under certain circumstances such as when used medicinally. It does not indicate anything about strength but rather concentration. This means that you could make a product with 50% ABV which would only be rated 100 proof since it contains half the amount of sugar.",

The fully contained events and partially contained events are two main categories of neutrino interaction types that detected in the Super-Kamiokande.

        "Oh, I think I can answer that question! You know how sometimes you hear a song and it gets stuck in your head? Well, that's because your brain has a habit of latching onto catchy tunes and replaying them over and over again. \n\nBut what about those random songs that pop up out of nowhere? Well, it turns out that our memories are closely tied to music. When we hear a song that we like or that has a strong emotional connection, our brain forms a powerful association between the music and the moment. \n\nSo even years down the line, our brain still has that association, and it can trigger the song to play in our head when we least expect it. It could be a smell, a place, or even just a random thought that brings up that long-forgotten tune. \n\nAnother theory is that our brain is actually trying to distract us from whatever we're currently focused on. Like when you're doing a boring task, your brain might start playing a more interesting song to keep you engaged. \n\nIn the end, there's still a lot we don't know about why our brain starts randomly playing songs.

Extensive experiments on MSRA shared task 2016, SQuAD 1.0, and SQuAD 2.0 datasets demonstrate that our CAAQN approach outperforms the strong competitive baseline methods.' Overall, this work makes the following significant contributions: 1. It is the first work to leverage context information for extracting effective representation for each question position. 2. It is the first work to generate answer and mask predictions simultaneously. 3. It studies three new datasets (MSRA shared task 2016, SQuAD 1.0, and SQuAD 2.0) which are very important for the task of interactive question answering. Strength: The paper is the first work to leverage context information for extracting effective representation for each question position. Weakness: It is the first work to generate answer and mask predictions simultaneously. Generalization: The paper studies three new datasets (MSRA shared task 2016, SQuAD 1.0, and SQuAD 2.0) which are very important for the task of interactive question answering. authors: Shuai Li, Hao Zhang, Yonghui Wu contact: shuaigl(at)umn.edu github: https://github.com/su1138/CAAQN",

The data were obtained with the Keck telescope and HIRES spectrograph over three nights during August 2005. We measure heliocentric radial velocities ranging between -150 to +50 km/sec. These values are consistent with previous measurements made by other authors using different techniques. Using these new data we have determined that there is no significant rotation or streaming motion within this system. This result supports theoretical predictions based on N-body simulations which suggest that dark matter halos should be nearly spherical systems. In addition, our results provide further evidence against the possibility that Leo II may contain an intermediate mass black hole at its center. \n \n Keywords: Dwarf galaxies; Black holes; Dark Matter Halos; Rotation Curves; Stellar Kinematics; Spherical Symmetry",

        "Write a long abstract of a scientific paper from arXiv.org. Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"On Einstein clusters as galactic dark matter halos\".\nAbstract:\nWe present the results of an analysis of galaxy cluster data in terms of their gravitational lensing properties and X-ray emission, with particular emphasis on the comparison between observed and predicted values for the mass-to-light ratio M/L. We find that the best-fit value of this quantity is consistent with the predictions based on standard CDM models if one assumes that most of the baryonic component of these systems resides within galaxies rather than being distributed throughout the intracluster medium (ICM). This result suggests that the ICM may be heated by some mechanism other than gravity alone. \n \n Keywords: Galaxy cluster, Dark Matter Halo, Gravitational Lensing, Mass-to-Light Ratio, X-Ray Emission \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n The study of galaxy clusters has been instrumental to our understanding of cosmology over the past few decades. In fact, it was through observations of galaxy clusters that we first discovered evidence supporting the existence of non-baryonic dark matter [1] . Today, galaxy clusters are still used extensively to test theories about structure formation [2] , and they provide important constraints on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant [3] or the equation-of-state parameter w [4] . \n \n However, despite all its successes, there remain several open questions regarding galaxy clusters which have yet to be answered satisfactorily. For example, while current observational techniques allow us to measure accurately the total amount of light emitted by a galaxy cluster, it remains difficult to determine how much of this light comes from stars inside individual galaxies versus diffuse gas located outside them [5] . Similarly, although we can estimate fairly well the total gravitating mass of a galaxy cluster using various methods [6] , it is not clear what fraction of this mass is associated with visible objects like galaxies [7, 8] . Finally, even though we know that galaxy clusters contain large amounts of hot plasma [9] , it is unclear whether this material is gravitationally bound to the system [10] .\n \nIn order to address these issues, we will use two different datasets obtained from the Chandra Observatory [11] : the sample of galaxy clusters studied by Vikhlinin et",

        "In this paper of a series investigating solar-physics applications of the equation-of-state formalism based on Feynman-Kac (FK) representation, the pertinent FK equation of state is introduced and its domain of validity is assessed. Specifically, the FK approach is suitable for physical conditions where more than 90% of helium is ionized, including the interior of the Sun up to about 0.98 of its radius. Though limited, in the regions of the Sun where it applies the FK equation of state is expected to be more accurate than current equations of state used to model the Sun. Specifically, the FK equation of state has the potential to explore physical effects such as Coulomb screening, bound states, recombination of fully-ionized species, and diffraction and exchange effects. The results of this research can be used to inform improved models of the Sun, as well as to develop tighter solar constraints on the equation of state.",
        "\n\nIt can be difficult to help a hyposensitive autistic person, who may exhibit hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors (stimming), and sensory issues. But with a bit of understanding and knowledge, you can support them in finding ways to manage and cope with their particular needs. \n\nTo start, it is important to realize that sensory processing is a highly individual experience and that the symptoms vary both from day to day and from person to person. Ask the person directly about what they've found to be helpful in managing their sensory processing disorder. Connect with other autistic people who may have recommendations and talk to your doctor or mental health professional about hospital-based, local or national support groups for this disorder. \n\nYou may also want to look for an occupational therapist who can work with your friend to build a sensory diet - or a plan of activities - that may help them. This could involve activities like rocking back and forth, spinning, deep pressure, and other sensory-based activities. Be patient and accommodating throughout this process. \n\nOnce you've sought professional help, there are a lot of things you can do to provide support in a day-to-day way. Decorate the space around your friend with bright colors and plenty of stimulating decorations and cues. Stock up on huge stim toys like floor puzzles and jigsaw puzzle and keep them around the house. If you notice they like certain colors, try to pick out things with those colors when you shop together. \n\nProvide opportunities where they can make a lot of noise without bothering others. Invest in a good pair of headphones or earplugs for yourself so you can still be around. Have a fun attitude about it and join in the noise if you feel comfortable. You might also buy strong-smelling products like scented markers, strong-smelling gum, or essential oils; they can use them as a sensory stay during their day. When cooking, allow them to put spices on the side or serve them their own cup of flavored milk. \n\nIf you notice that your friend has difficulty sitting calmly, especially after prolonged use of energy, take a break. Take a walk or some other kind of physical activity. You might also look into getting an exercise ball or a special seat wedge cushion designed to give extra support. \n\nAlso, keep an eye out for potential injuries. While stimming can be a way for them to cope, it can also be dangerous if they are smashing their head against a wall or hitting themselves with a toy. Talk to children who may be inadvertently participating in this behavior about being gentle and understanding. If they need it, provide positive attention through physical contact like massage or hugs. \n\nFinally, create a cushioned area, like a bed, couch, or a pile of pillows, where they can crash into. Help your autistic friend access these resources and create positive experiences in managing hyposensitivity.",
        "\n\nWe present the first study of satellite galaxies and fossil groups in a realistic galaxy formation simulation. We use the Millennium Simulation, a large scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulation including both dark matter and gas, with a resolution of $44\\,$hMpc, which can be used to study the formation history of galaxies up to redshift $z\\sim 1$. In our analysis we identify satellite galaxies using three different methods, and use the galaxy membership probabilities to derive the satellite metallicity and star formation density distribution. We find that the satellite galaxy population as a whole is very metal-poor and displays a star formation density excess of $\\sim 30\\%$ with respect to the main galaxy population, but the satellites of individual galaxies show much larger differences, up to an excess of $\\sim 300\\%$. We find that the stellar mass of the largest satellite in a system is proportional to the stellar mass of the main galaxy, and we show this relation to be consistent with the prediction of the Barred-iminicity theory of galaxy formation. We also analyse the formation of fossil groups, and find that the probability of a group of galaxies to be fossil is inversely proportional to the group mass. We discuss our results in the context of theories of galaxy formation and the formation history of the Local Volume Group.",

        "This is a great question, I did a bit of research and here is what I found out. During world war two the British government built three synthetic aperture radar sites in England to watch over the Battle of Britain. There was never any intention that these sites should be used against Germany if England was attacked but the radar was invaluable in identifying attacks on England from Germany. The first ever application of radar during a war. The site were I believe you are referring to was known as 'Randolph' and it was built in the Royal Air Force arial refueling station at Woodley in Berkshire. The site was operational from 1933 until late 1941 when it was hit by German bombers during the blitz. The radar equipment was damaged and never restored. The site was used briefly during world war two to monitor US coasts until the equipment was also damaged by German bombers and never restored. The site was then abandoned and left to ruin. It is likely that this site was used to watch over New York City during the 1933 blizzard. The site may actually have even been used to watch over other areas of the USA during the second world war as Britain was vulnerable to German attack and the US military were wary of getting involved as they wanted to stay out of the second world war.",

        "A Housing Action Trust (HAT) is a unit established by the British government in the late 1980s to improve the quality and conditions of public housing in England. It was created as part of the Conservative Party's plan to reform the public housing sector. The Housing Action Trust was a major step by the Conservative government to deal with the problems of the public housing sector. The main goal of the HAT was to improve the quality of housing in deprived areas, reduce crime and anti-social behavior, and provide better services. The establishment of a Housing Action Trust involves the transfer of ownership and management of public housing estates from the local authority to a new organization set up to manage the estate. The HAT is given the responsibility of improving the estate, which may involve refurbishment, rebuilding, or a combination of both. The government funded and oversaw the HAT initiative, which was similar to a quasi-public authority. Housing Action Trusts were designed to be self-financing, and their success was measured on achieving financial self-sufficiency in five years. This was also a way to reduce the dependence of public housing on government funding and increase local accountability. However, the effectiveness of the Housing Action Trusts has been a matter of debate. Critics argue that the HAT initiative did not lead to significant long-term improvement in the quality of public housing. The HATs were also accused of undermining the democratic control of local authorities by transferring ownership and management to a centralized government body. Despite the criticisms, some estates that were transferred to the HATs did see improvements in the quality of housing, services, and security. The Housing Action Trust model was employed in several areas across the United Kingdom, and the initiative was eventually phased out in the early 2000s.",

        "We demonstrate improved text-to-image synthesis with controllable object locations using an extension of Pixel Convolutional Neural Networks (PixelCNN). In addition to conditioning on text, we show how the model can generate images conditioned on part keypoints and segmentation masks. The character-level text encoder and image generation network are jointly trained end-to-end via maximum likelihood. We establish quantitative baselines in terms of text and structure-conditional pixel log-likelihood for three data sets: Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB), MPII Human Pose (MHP), and Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO). I think this work is of interest to the community and should be published in a well-known journal. General comments The work presents a promising application of PixelCNN architecture to image synthesis using text descriptions. Compared to existing approaches, the text-conditioned generation with pixel-level control over object location, shape, and appearance has not been demonstrated before. The code and data are made publicly available, which I believe will encourage future researchers to evaluate and validate the claims of the paper. Suggested improvements/changes It may be useful to provide more information about the software and hardware environment used for evaluation. The main limitations of the current evaluation environment should be highlighted. General comments The paper presents an interesting idea and is clearly written. It would be beneficial to provide more information about the software and hardware environment used for evaluation. Suggested improvements/changes The work was evaluated using a single Nvidia GTX 2080Ti GPU with Ubuntu 18.04 as operating system, and the code and data are available at [GitHub repository](https://github.com/scansources/controlled-text-to-image). The main limitations of the current evaluation environment should be highlighted. The method can be slow when generating images of high resolution (e.g., $1024 \\times 1024$ pixels) or complex scenes. The text generation is at character level. The framework could be applied to image synthesis with fine-grained control over part locations, however the memory consumption will increase when more parts need to be conditioned. ## Citation If accepted, this will be included in the final version of the paper.

        "Winona Lake Historic District is a picturesque tourist attraction and residential district located in the town of Winona Lake, Kosciusko County, Indiana, United States. The district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, added on November 4, 1982. The district is situated on the eastern shore of a lake and is considered a haven for water recreation. It was founded in the early 20th century as a retreat center for the former Indiana governor, James A. Mount, who transformed a swampy area into a recreational resort. The district was originally designed to cater to those seeking religious retreat and spiritual enrichment. The area is known for its unique historical buildings, architecture, and community lifestyle that reflects the early 20th-century Midwestern culture. It features over 20 different architectural styles of buildings of various sizes, from small cottages to grandiose mansions. The district also incorporates several local landmarks, such as the Winona Hotel, the Phelps Memorial Hospital, and the Winona Assembly Hall. The Winona Hotel, built in 1924, is an imposing, colonial revival structure that served as an exclusive vacation destination for the wealthy and elite. The Phelps Memorial Hospital, built-in 1915 in the classic revival style, originally served as a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients. Today it is an assisted living center and nursing home. The Winona Assembly Hall, built-in 1894, is a charming Swiss chalet-style building that now serves as the town hall. The district has a unique connection with the broader religious Christian community. The famed evangelist, Billy Sunday, lived and preached in Winona Lake for several years, and the popular, Christian author, Alisa Childers, grew up in the area. The Winona Lake Historic District has a rich and diverse history and has been maintained over the years in its original character. It continues to attract tourists who are interested in exploring the region's history and culture.",
        " Gorillas on the Mast is an American musical ensemble formed in 2011 by siblings Isaac, Robert, and Talise Fisher and their friends Alex Gorant and Chris Anderson. The group was formed in New Orleans and grew to a rotating cast of seven to nine members. The bands unique eclectic sound of modern folk, gypsy jazz, calypso, klezmer, and other folk-infused music, combines multiple genres and styles with acoustic string instruments to create a truly original, unforgettable sound. The band’s 2008 release, Bonehorse, earned them a nomination for Southwestern Regional Jazz Improvisation Band of the Year honors. Their follow-up album Boff, released in 2010, was met with even more critical acclaim. Backed by Contemporary Artist David Lanier on the upright bass, Gorillas on the Mast is often compared to classic gypsy punks Gogol Bordello and Firewater. Gorillas on the Mast has built an impressive career touring alongside acts including Railroad Earth, Greensky Bluegrass, Rebirth Brass Band, and Kool and the Gang. They have also appeared at festivals such as New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, LOCKN Festival, Summer Camp Festival, Founders Fest and others. The group has received rave reviews from music critics and performed at popular music venues throughout the US. The group’s latest album, A Sailors Repose, was released in 2019. The record has a looser feel than its predecessors, as the more free-form improvisation takes center-stage. A Sailors Repose has since been applauded by fans and critics alike as the Gorillas on the Mast’s most polished effort to date. Gorillas on the Mast have become one of the heaviest-hitting American musical groups of the last decade. The groups genre-bending sound and live stage shows have continuously caught the eye of the music industry, solidifying their place as one of the top folk acts of the decade. ",

        "Using high-resolution Millenium Simulation, we show that the intergalactic Lyman α radiation (Hz width) provides a significant source of effective UV radiation at the frequency of the hyperfine structure transition of the ground state of atomic hydrogen (1216.5 MHz). We demonstrate that this effect can potentially explain the sky-averaged 21 cm signal observed at $z \\sim 0.6$ with the EDGES Low band. We analyze the effect of this Lyman α radiative transfer on the spin temperature and discuss the required constraints from the absorption profile of the Lyman α background. Our results show that the spin temperature of the hyperfine transition of the 21 cm hydrogen can be reduced by up to 6000 K, thus providing a natural solution to the low-level EDGES signal. The required HI density is relatively modest, $\\sim 0.2-1$ cm-3 at $z \\sim 0.6$, which is typical of under-dense regions observed in the large-scale structure. The absorption profile of the Lyman α background has broad damping wings that can sufficiently suppress the spin temperature over a large fraction of the observed 21 cm absorption profile. This result suggests that the EDGES Low signal was produced by the detectable astrophysical radio sources, such as stars and galactic black holes, and is not a spurious detection. Lyman α radiative transfer provides a robust mechanism to generate the EDGES Low signal and avoid current absorption-based constraints, and thus can potentially explain the EDGES observations.

The X-ray spectrum is consistent with emission from a magnetar; however, we find no pulsations in our data set. We also present optical spectroscopy of two stars near the center of the remnant which show strong Balmer absorption lines characteristic of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars; these are likely to be associated with the supernova event that created the remnant. \n \n Keywords: Supernova remnants, Pulsar wind nebulae, Wolf Rayets, Chandra, XMM-NEWTON, VLA, Optical Spectroscopy \n \n Introduction \n \n In this Letter, we report on new observational results concerning the possible association between the candidate magnetar 1E 1547.0+ 5408 , located at the center of the supernova remnant G327.24 -0.13 , and its surrounding environment. This object was discovered by the Einstein Observatory as part of the first systematic survey of the Galactic plane (Hertz & Grindlay 1984) . It has been observed several times since then using different instruments including ASCA (Sugizaki et al. , 1997) , BeppoSAX (Giacani et al. , 2001 ) , RXTE (Israel et al. , 2002 ) and Chandra (Pavlov et al. , 2004 ) . Its position coincides within errors with the brightest peak of the radio shell detected by the VLA (Kothes et al. , 2006 ; Gaensler et al. , 2008 ) . However, there have been conflicting reports about whether or not it shows any periodic behavior. While Israel et al. (2002) reported detection of a periodicity of 6 s during their observation campaign, Sugizaki et al. (1997) found only marginal evidence for such a signal when they analyzed archival ASCA data.

        " Nimbarka Sampradaya The Nimbarka Sampradaya (IAST: Nimbāraka Sampradāya), also known as the Nimbarka Paramparā, is a Hindu Vaishnava sampradaya, or tradition, named after Nimbarka, a medieval philosopher and theologian who lived around the 13th century. Nimbarka Sampradaya is a monistic sampradaya that believes that the impersonal absolute, which is formless and alikethat is, it has no attributes or gunas, is the only reality, and that all else is illusion. Nimbarka is said to have appeared in a red-limbed form, and his name literally means \"the one who appeared in a red form\". The Nimbarka Sampradaya is considered to be a sampradaya, as it has all the basic elements of a sampradaya, such as a founding philosopher (Nimbarka), a philosophical system, a scripture, and a tradition. The Nimbarka Sampradaya is sometimes considered to be a part of the larger Ramanuja Sampradaya, as Nimbarka is said to have been a disciple of Ramanuja. However, both Nimbarka and his disciples are said to have made significant contributions to the Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism. The Nimbarka Sampradaya is closely associated with the Vallabha Sampradaya, and the two are sometimes considered to be the same. However, the Nimbarka Sampradaya is, in fact, an independent sampradaya, and most of its members are unaware of any connection with the Vallabha Sampradaya. The two sampradayas differ in their philosophy, with the Nimbarka Sampradaya being monistic and the Vallabha Sampradaya being dualistic.",

        "In this work, we present a quantum simulation of interacting high-dimensional systems and analyze their behavior in the presence of noise. Our aim is to investigate the role of noise in the performance of quantum simulations and explore the strategies to overcome its adverse effects. High-dimensional systems pose a significant challenge for numerical simulations due to the exponential increase in the number of parameters as the dimensionality increases. Quantum simulation is a promising approach to study these systems, using quantum devices as simulators. However, such simulations are prone to errors induced by noise, which can lead to incorrect results. \n\nTo mitigate the effect of noise, we apply different error mitigation techniques such as noise filtering and error correction codes. We use a tensor network-based algorithm to simulate the dynamics of interacting high-dimensional systems and quantify the effects of noise. Our simulations reveal that error mitigation techniques can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of quantum simulations, even in the presence of noise.\n\nOur results demonstrate the importance of developing noise-tolerant quantum algorithms for simulations of high-dimensional systems. Our study opens up new avenues for exploring quantum simulations of complex systems and has broader implications for the design of experiments in quantum computing.",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Non-saturating magnetoresistance of inhomogeneous conductors: comparison of experiment and simulation\".\nAbstract:\nWe report on the non-saturating magnetoresistance (NSMR) effect observed for thin films with an inhomogeneous distribution of charge carriers, which is caused by their trapping at defects or impurities. We show that this NSMR can be explained within the framework of the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory if one takes into account the spatial dependence of the scattering time. The latter was calculated using Monte Carlo simulations based on the solution of the kinetic equation for electrons interacting with phonons and static disorder potential fluctuations. Our results are compared to experimental data obtained for InAs/GaSb superlattices grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Non-saturating magnetoresistivity has been recently discovered in various materials including semiconductors [1] , metals [2] , carbon nanotubes [3] . This phenomenon manifests itself as a linear increase of resistivity ρ(H) ∝ H when magnetic field H increases up to several Tesla. It is believed that it originates from the presence of spatially localized states near the Fermi level [4] .\nIn this work we study the non-saturating magnetotransport properties of semiconductor heterostructures consisting of alternating layers of GaSb/InAs. These structures were grown by molecular beam epi-taxy [5] . They have a high density of structural imperfections such as dislocations [6] and stacking faults [7] . As a result, they exhibit strong electron localization [8] leading to pronounced quantum confinement effects [9] . Figure 1 shows typical temperature dependences of resistance R xx measured along the growth direction z for different values of applied magnetic fields. One can see that all curves demonstrate metallic behavior down to low temperatures T < 2 K. At higher temperatures there appears a weak insulating-like behavior due to thermally activated hopping between localized states [10] . For small magnetic fields [ Fig.  1(a) ] the resistance decreases monotonically upon cooling indicating the dominance of elastic scattering processes [11] . However, for larger fields [Figs. 1(c),1(d)] the resistance exhibits non-monotonic behavior with a minimum around 10-20 K followed by",
        "In this paper, we propose a variational geomagnetic data assimilation approach to understand the dynamics of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems. We investigate a one-dimensional, nonlinear MHD system that is sparsely observed. Our methodology involves defining a cost function that quantifies the difference between available observational data and model predictions. Using this cost function, we then optimize the model parameters using a variational technique. The optimization problem is formulated as a minimization of the cost function subject to the constraints imposed by the MHD system. By using the variational assimilation approach, we can use all available data while being consistent with the physical laws governing the MHD system.\n\nWe apply our approach to a simulation of solar wind using a sparse set of observations, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the variational assimilation approach in obtaining more accurate predictions compared to traditional data assimilation methods. Our results show that the proposed approach is capable of estimating the model parameters accurately and can provide realistic predictions of the magnetic field, plasma velocity, and pressure of the MHD system.\n\nThis work aims to solve the problem of estimating model parameters in MHD simulations using sparse and noisy observational data. Our approach provides a useful tool for integrating observational data into MHD simulations, thus improving the accuracy and reliability of predictions. The proposed methodology can be extended to multi-dimensional, time-varying MHD systems, making it suitable for applications in space weather forecasting, climate adaptation, and fluid dynamics.",

        "Being wealthy in the bronze age meant having a high volume of gold coins within a home. Such a large amount of wealth would be representative of a person that lived a life of leisure, possibly through inheritance. People in the bronze age were beginning to see some separation from the peasant class due to this volume of wealth. Additionally, having possession of a chariot would have been another sign of great wealth, as this was an expensive piece of machinery at the time. To protect your wealth from robbers, you would have stored the coins in a secure building, such as a castle or a temple. Being wealthy in the bronze age would have been a time of relative stability and comfort. No one would have thought of being wealthy as poor, as people generally did not consider poverty to be an even possibility. It is only through the lens of history that we can now view this time as being a time of wealth. -- The bronze age in Europe started around 3300 BCE and ended around 500 BCE. During this time, metallurgy was developed and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, became the material of choice for manufacturing tools and weapons. Copper was a critical component in the creation of bronze, and in many areas farmers were able to turn wheat and barley into bronze through a process of metalworking. The result of this Bronze Age Collapse was a return to a more agriculturally based society. While bronze gave rise to significant advances in technology, such as the creation of weapons and tools that were more sophisticated and more durable than those that were made of iron, it also led to a degree of societal upheaval as people began to see some separation from the peasant class due to this volume of wealth.

        "While it is possible that subterranean life forms may exist differently than life above ground, there is no conclusive evidence to support this. It is suspected that a great number of micro-organisms can survive in the darkest recesses of the Earth, due to the presence of heat and water, however, much more research needs to be done to confirm this. If there is life beneath us, it would most likely look very different to life on the surface. For starters, creature deep underground would have to endure much higher temperatures and lower oxygen levels than we see on the surface. Secondly, due to the lower pressure at depth, sea creatures living deep underwater would probably be unable to leave the seafloor and live on the surface. Instead, they would have to adapt to life in the deep sea. Scientists believe that life on Earth has likely existed in some form or another throughout its 4.5 billion year history. The first signs of life are believed to have emerged about 3.8 billion years ago, shortly after the formation of the planet, in what is known as the Progenitor Biosphere. The first life forms may have emerged from water blessed by geothermal energy, which then started toting life from one environment to another. In our search for life beyond Earth, it is important not to get too fixated on finding one particular type of life form. There is no reason to believe that forms of life other than bacteria cannot exist on other planets. All it would take is for something suitable to random crop up here on Earth. In our quest to find life outside our planet, it is also important not to discount the possibility of life existing in our own backyard. After all, the discovery of living organisms in Scottish caves in 2018 raised hope that life could exist beneath the Earth's surface, even though the exact origin of the life forms remains unknown. In conclusion, while we still know relatively little about life on our own planet, what we do know suggests that it is most likely very common throughout the universe. As such, the likelihood of there being no life in the universe remains high. We simply have no definitive evidence of its existence. However, the discovery of life beneath the Earth's surface, if it were to occur, would be a significant milestone in human history. It would herald the discovery of a whole new world, and change the way we view our place in the universe for ever. While scientists continue to search for evidence of life on other planets, we must also continue to ensure that we do not pollute our own planet, and limit the risk of species extinction on this Earth. Until we discover living creatures elsewhere in the universe, the debate on the existence of life beneath the Earth's surface remains open.

        "\n\nEvicting a tenant in New York is not always an easy process. If you are a landlord, it is important to make sure that you are properly following the law and understanding all of the steps that must be taken in order to properly evict a tenant. Of course, before attempting to evict a tenant, it is important to make sure that you are taking the necessary steps to try and resolve the issue with the tenant first. \n\nOne of the first things you should do as a landlord when it comes to evicting a tenant is to determine the reasons that you can lawfully evict a tenant. Some of the reasons include non-payment of rent, tenant not following the terms of the lease or rental agreement, engaging in illegal activity, or remaining on the property without permission after the lease has ended. \n\nBefore proceeding with eviction, it is important to make sure that as a landlord you meet all of your responsibilities. This includes ensuring that everything is up to code, that the tenancy is in accordance with the lease, and that all of the required paperwork is up to date and completed. \n\nAs a landlord, you will also need to decide who will serve (deliver) notices on the tenant. Once you have made the decision, it is important that you are aware of the rules for properly serving (delivering) the notices to the tenant. Different state and local laws may have different rules and regulations about the notices and how they must be delivered or served. It is also important to learn the permitted time frame for proper service of the notices. \n\nIf the eviction is due to non-payment of rent, then the landlord will need to serve a rent demand on the tenant. This notice must include the total amount of the rent due, the date that the rent was due, and the date that the notice was sent.\n\nIf the grounds for eviction does not involve non-payment of rent, then there are other notices that must be served on the tenant. This includes a Notice to Quit which should be given to someone who is living on the property without the landlord's permission. The notice should include the date that the notice was sent, the date by which the tenant is required to leave the property, and confirmation that the tenancy has been terminated. \n\nOnce all of the notices have been properly served on the tenant, the landlord can move forward with filing (starting) the complaint in the appropriate court. To do this, the landlord will need to obtain the proper forms from the court. The forms will need to be filled out completely and legible. \n\nOnce the papers have been completed, the landlord must take them to the court for filing. The landlord should also serve copies of the filed eviction documents on the tenant. The landlord should also plan on taking part in two separate hearings that will typically be held within five to ten days from each other. \n\nThe landlord will also need to prepare witnesses and make sure that all of the evidence they need is brought to the court on the hearing date. If the landlord is not ready to present their case on the hearing date, they will need to request an adjournment. In addition, the landlord should try to observe some landlord-tenant cases that are happening before their hearing date to get an idea of how the court works. \n\nIf the judge rules in favor of the landlord, then they will be required to request a Warrant of Eviction. This will give the landlord the authority to have the tenant removed from the premises. The appropriate law enforcement officer will need to be provided with the Warrant of Eviction and the landlord will need to follow up with the officer. \n\nIf the tenant has left property on the premises, the landlord will need to store the belongings in accordance with the law. The landlord will also need to look into whether or not the tenant can be liable for any costs associated with storing the property. If the judge rules against the landlord, then they still have the option to appeal the decision. \n\nBy following the steps laid out in this article, landlords in New York will be well on their way to evicting a tenant legally and properly.",

We use digital optical images, long-slit spectra, and HI line profiles in order to gain parameters that are relevant to disk scaling relations. Furthermore, our sample includes previously published data sets in addition to a new sample of 2000 objects. To assign galaxies to groups or clusters and reduce the scatter caused by local orbital motions, both the percolation algorithm and the Voronoi-Delaunay method have been employed. Corrections towards peculiar velocities have been made in regard to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous Malmquist bias, with the density field of the 2MASS Redshift Survey acquainting this process. In conclusion, the final SFI++ catalog includes 4861 field and cluster galaxies, allowing the study of detailed local velocity fields as well as global flows. ",
        "In Victorian Britain, the things that were considered politically correct or incorrect in both journalism and every day conversation were both very different from today's standard. In the Victorian era, there were many topics that were considered inappropriate to talk about in polite conversation, and if it was printed in the newspapers it could get you into trouble.\n\nIn journalism, certain topics were off-limits and criticism of the government or the monarchy was always frowned upon. Likewise, journalists were expected to be factual and unbiased when sharing their stories. Any stories that included false information or rumor were not tolerated.\n\nWhen people were speaking informally in everyday conversation, it was still considered inappropriate to engage in certain topics. Discussions about money, for example, were considered very rude. People also avoided talking about politics, religion, and other ‘controversial’ subjects. Additionally, it was considered poor manners to swear and speak too loudly.\n\nParticular attention was also given to how someone dressed, as clothing was seen as a reflection of one's social status. Women were expected to be dressed modestly and certainly could not go around dressed like men. Men were expected to dress conservatively at all times, as anything too flashy or flamboyant was seen inappropriate.\n\nVictorian Britain was quite different from today and although many conventions are the same, it’s interesting to go back in time and consider how different ideas of what was politically appropriate were back then. It’s amazing to ponder just how many things have changed over time.",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"A kind of prediction from string phenomenology: extra matter at low energy\".\nAbstract:\nWe propose that the Standard Model (SM) is completed by adding new particles and interactions, which are predicted to appear in many different contexts within String Theory. In particular we consider the possibility that there exists an additional U(1) gauge symmetry associated with a hidden sector containing light states charged under this group. We show how such a scenario can be realised using Type IIB orientifolds compactified on Calabi-Yau three-folds. The resulting model contains two sectors connected via gravitational interactions mediated by Kaluza-Klein modes. One of these sectors consists of SM fields while the other one includes exotic states charged under both the SM and the hidden U(1). These states have masses below 1 TeV and couple very weakly to ordinary matter. This leads to interesting signatures for collider experiments as well as possible effects in precision measurements. Finally, we discuss some cosmological implications of our proposal.",

As an application, we show that certain local Euler characteristics of these representations are equal to the number of non-trivial real roots of certain polynomial equations.",
        "Castillo de San José is a ruined castle in the Mexican state of Puebla. It sits at an elevation of some 270 meters (848 feet) above the valley floor and has fantastic views of the surrounding countryside. The castle is believed to have been built during the early years of Spanish control of the region, although there are some suggesting that it may have been built as early as the year 0. The castle is located on land that in the colonial era was property of the locally important Nájera family. Over the years the castle was attacked and occupied by various groups, including Royalists fighting for the Spanish king during the Mexican War of Independence and in the French Intervention in Mexico, and later during the Mexican Revolution it was occupied by revolutionary groups on several occasions, most notably in 1915 when it was taken by Pancho Villa. The castle was subsequently occupied by criminal groups in the years following the Mexican Revolution and finally was abandoned and left to decay. The castle is located on a hilltop and has various towers and walls along its periphery, the castle is believed to have had a total of five defensive towers. The castle is connected to the remains of an old mill, this was likely used during the time it was occupied by Juan Najera, the mill is believed to have been used to grind maize. The castle is designated as Puebla's Historic Monument number 242. The castle sits at the edge of the village of San José Itaxtla, Puebla and is an easy day trip from the city of Puebla. The castle is open to the public and can be easily visited, despite this it is not the most popular of attractions in the area and can often be visited without the need to pay the admission fee.",

We focus on the steady-state mean-field magnetohydrodynamics equations, accounting for the imperfect conduction of current, and derive a general analytical solution corresponding to Keplerian rotation, along with expressions for the magnetic field and surface density as a function of position. Using observations on T Tauri stars, FU Orionis stars, and low- and high-mass protostars, we compare our model's predictions with reality and explore possible causes for high and low models of the disk. Our results also yield expressions for turbulent viscosity and turbulent resistivity.",
        "\n\n\nHow to Know When to Tell Someone You Like Them\nTelling someone you like them can be a nerve-wracking experience, especially if you don't know how they feel, or when the right time should be. While there may never be a perfect time, there are some tips to help you decide when and how to tell someone you like them. These strategies will help you build confidence, plan the right moment, and ultimately make a move.\n\n1. Have self confidence. It is important to believe in yourself before you tell someone you like them. People can sense when you lack self-confidence, making them less likely to reciprocate your feelings. Have faith in yourself and know that you are worthy of love.\n\n2. Spend some time together. Get to know the person you like and spend time with them. You can't know if you want to tell someone how you feel until you've spent time with them in a variety of settings. Hang out with them, talk to them, and find out if you have a connection.\n\n3. Find somewhere you and this person can be alone together, even if you're just behind the crowd talking to each other. This will give you a chance to talk in some privacy to see if a deeper moment is possible. \n\n4. Get comfortable with the person. Once you've enjoyed this time together in a variety of settings, you should feel comfortable around the person and start to gauge if the feeling is mutual. \n\n5. Go with your gut. After you've spent time with the person, your heart will have an answer. If you feel that telling them how you feel is the right thing to do, you should take the risk. \n\n6. If you are friends but not in regular contact then, you have to get them to interact with you and then you have to be with them to then tell them how you feel. After establishing contact, take the time to get to know them and feel out the situation.\n\n7. It will probably be a moment where you're talking alone with this person when you can say \"I was wondering, do you like me?\" This can be the perfect moment to tell them how you feel. If you feel like the conversation is at a certain point where this could start to happen, make a move. \n\n8. It might feel like there never is a time to tell them. If you absolutely can't find a moment to sit down and tell them, send them a text or leave a thoughtful note. There's no time like the present to tell someone how you feel. \n\n9. Always tell the truth to them. Whether you tell them in person, over text, or any other method, be honest and sincere about your feelings. Be honest; everyone likes somebody who will tell them the truth, even if that's not exactly what they wanted to hear.\n\n10. Don't go straight out and ask your crush do they like you. Start the conversation in a casual way. Find out what they think and gauge their reaction. \n\n11. Become good friends with your crush and get to know them. This is a great way to get to know them and also gives you more chances to hang out together. If your crush knows you, you can be more confident that they will like you in return.\n\n12. Compliment them and make it clear that you admire and appreciate them. Doing this will encourage the person to feel the same way towards you. Show your interest in them, so they know you like them, and don't be intimidated.\n\n13. Some playful teasing is ok but never be mean or cruel and then act as if it was a joke because that will only turn them off of you. Instead, choose your words carefully and be sure that what you say communicates an appreciation, affection, and admiration for the person.\n\n14. Hug them at lunchtime or something, but not every hour of the day. A hug can be a great way to tell someone you're interested without words. But don't overdo it or else it will start to feel awkward. \n\n15. Text them a little bit after you saw each other. This is a great chance to talk to them away from the real life and let your feelings come out in a chat conversation. You don't have to kiss for hours or just talk about feelings, but you should make it clear that your friendship is more than just friends. \n\nAbove all, you have to be honest with the other person. Telling them you like them is a big step, so consider your timing, build your confidence, and go with your gut. With a bit of preparation and thought, you will be able to tell your crush how you feel and take your relationship to the next level.",

The first known use of lowercase letters is dated back to about 800 AD. In this period there were no capital letters at all! After that time they gradually became more common until finally replacing uppercase ones completely around 1500 AD. Around 1600 AD, English began using both upper- and lowercase letters. Before then only capitals had been used. During the 19th century, most European languages adopted the practice of writing with both types of lettering. About 1700 AD. Lower-case letters appeared after the fall of Rome, but before the rise of England's power.

        "\n\nHow to Breed Budgies\nBreeding budgies can be a wonderful addition to any home, as they bring joy through their bright colors and sweet chattering. But before you start to breed budgies, there are a few important steps you should take. \n\nDecide whether you really want to breed budgies. Breeding budgies comes with a host of responsibilities, including the proper care of both the adults and the babies. If you are not able to devote the time and resources to properly caring for your budgies, you should reconsider breeding. \n\nFind a suitable room to breed budgies. This is important, as your budgies will be contained in the room you choose. You should also ensure that there is enough ventilation and no drafts during the cold months. \n\nSet up a suitable cage. It should be large enough to accommodate both the adult and baby budgies, and you should also provide plenty of toys, perches, and proper bedding.\n \nGet all the items needed. You will need proper bird food, a water bottle, bird bath, perches, toys, and any accessories that you feel are necessary. \n\nSet up a place for an neglected baby budgie just in case. You never know when this might be necessary, so it’s best to be prepared to care for a baby bird if necessary.\n\nBuy or make a reasonably sized nest box. Budgerigars like to nest in boxes, so it is important to be sure the box is large enough for them. \n\nMake a budgie coconut husk nest box, if desired. Coconut husk is a natural material that provides a safe and comfortable environment for the budgies to nest. \n\nFind a suitable breeding pair. It is important to carefully select a suitable breeding pair, considering factors such as their size, colors, and temperaments. \n\nEnsure that the breeding pair are cared for properly. This includes providing them with a healthy diet, a pleasant environment, and good hygiene. \n\nGive the budgies time to settle in. The birds will need time to get used to each other and their new environment before breeding. \n\nFind a suitable avian vet (specializes in birds) if you haven't already done so. If the birds become ill, you will need a qualified avian vet to treat them. \n\nFeed the budgies daily. Make sure the budgies receive a balanced diet, including fresh vegetables, fruit, and seeds. \n\nProvide plenty of fresh water for your budgies. Clean, fresh water should be changed daily or every other day to prevent bacteria and fungus growth. \n\nClean the cage once a week. This includes cleaning the cages, toys, nest boxes, perches, and other items that come in contact with the birds. \n\nWait. If all is going well, the breeding pair will start to breed. \n\nWhen eggs come about, wait until each one is five days old and candle them. The eggs should appear bright and even in texture.\n\nCheck the nest box regularly. This should be done at least once a week to feed them and to also check on the condition of the eggs and birds.\n\nNote that budgies have a very poorly developed sense of smell, so they will not care if you touch their babies. When handling and caring for the chicks, try to be as gentle as possible. \n\nObserve the chicks and the mother. Watch the mother for signs of aggression or neglect. If you notice any such behavior, separate the chicks and move them to a safe place. \n\nClean the nesting box and cage frequently. You should use a suitable disinfectant and change the bedding at least twice a month. \n\nWhen chicks reach three weeks old, or close to that, provide them with one millet spray each day. Chicks should not be fed more than once a day, and they should receive a balanced diet. \n\nProvide your chicks with seed. This will provide them with the essential nutrients they need for healthy growth. \n\nProvide chicks with a small hut on the ground if you wish to help them feel secure. Make sure it is in a quiet, draft-free area. \n \nIf you allow the hen to lay another round of eggs, she will often become aggressive towards the chicks. You should either separate the chicks and give them a safer environment or remove the eggs. \n\nRemove the nest box. Once the chicks have all been safely removed, the nest box should be removed from the cage. \n\nName your baby birds. Give them their own unique names, and enjoy watching them grow!",
        "A 4-digit code is a type of authentication method that requires the input of four numeric characters— such as a PIN code— to access a particular account. Although this method may seem to be quite secure and sufficient for banking purposes, it turns out that it is not the ideal option when it comes to most online accounts. \n\nTo begin with, 4-digit codes are vulnerable to brute force attacks, which means that if someone is determined to discover the code, they can try out every possible combination until they find the correct one. Furthermore, not only is it potentially possible to break in to an account using this method in the case of unsophisticated hackers, but even frequent criminals or experienced ones can reach their destination eventually if they are committed enough.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also important to point out that assigning a 4-digit code as a form of authentication can lead to false positives, meaning that it might accidentally grant access to someone who is not the real user. This is because there are only 10,000 different combinations, which significantly reduces the chances of coming up with the right one. Therefore, if the wrong code is used more than a handful of times, it is likely that someone will find their way in sooner or later.  \n\nFor this reason, more secure and sophisticated code systems are recommended when it comes to online accounts, such as two or three-factor authentication which consists of something that the user knows (such as a password), something that the user possesses (such as a smartphone), and something that the user is (such as a biometric scan). \n\nIn summary, 4-digit codes may be sufficient in certain contexts and may even have certain benefits. However, when it comes providing security for most online accounts, it is not enough and should not be relied upon by itself.",
        "Wow! That's a really cool idea. To make an explosion out of the energy we get from eating in one day! Well, I'm not sure I could tell you exactly how big the explosion would be, but I can tell you what would happen. \n\nWhen we eat, we digest the food, and turn it into energy. This energy gives us energy to do things like running and playing, but at the same time, it releases heat. All this heat energy is converted into tiny micro-explosions that help us digest the food. \n\nSo if we were to take ALL this energy and release it in one go, it would be like a mini-explosion. It wouldn't be as big as a real explosion, like the ones you see in movies with fire and burning buildings, but it still would be enough to create a bit of a shock wave. I'm guessing it wouldn't be enough to cause much damage, but if you were standing too close it might make you feel a bit weird. \n\nThe size of the explosion would depend on the food we eat, because different foods have different amounts of energy. The more energy-dense food we eat, the bigger the explosion. So if you ate a lot of candy and desserts, the explosion would probably be much bigger than if you ate a lot of vegetables. \n\nSo I'm not sure exactly how big a mini explosion would be if you took all the energy from eating in a day and released it in one go, but I'm guessing it's enough to make a bit of a spark and a bit of noise. \n\nThat's really cool though, and I'm sure it would be fun to see it happen.",

        "The paper \"Sigma Delta Quantized Networks\" addresses the problem of wasteful processing of deep neural networks for video data. In particular, the authors propose a new type of network, Sigma-Delta networks, which would scale the computation of each layer with the amount of change in the input and layer activations, rather than the size of the network. The authors also introduce an optimization method for converting pre-trained deep networks into Sigma-Delta networks, which they demonstrate could significantly reduce the computational cost of processing video data.\n\nThe strengths of this paper lie in the authors' innovative proposal for scaling the computation of deep neural networks, as well as the demonstrated potential for significant computational cost reduction. The optimization method presented for converting pre-trained deep networks into Sigma-Delta networks is also a significant contribution and could have practical applications in reducing the computational burden for video processing tasks. The results are promising and suggest that Sigma-Delta networks are a viable alternative to traditional convolutional networks for video processing tasks.\n\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses to the paper. One issue is that the authors do not provide a thorough comparison to other existing methods for reducing the computational cost of deep neural networks. It would be helpful to have a more detailed discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of Sigma-Delta networks compared to other methods, such as pruning, quantization, or low-rank approximation. Additionally, the proposed hardware requirements for running the algorithm at the scale required for video processing may limit the practical applicability of Sigma-Delta networks in certain contexts. The authors could benefit from discussing potential hardware limitations and future directions for making Sigma-Delta networks more widely available and practical.\n\nOverall, the paper provides an innovative proposal for optimizing deep neural networks for video processing tasks. While there are some limitations and challenges to the proposed method, Sigma-Delta networks have the potential for significant computational cost reduction, making the paper a valuable contribution and worth further exploration.",

        "\nWe have carried out a timing observation of the radio pulsar PSR J1930+1852 in the context of a wider search for pulsars in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The observations were made with the Whipple Observatory 10-m telescope and the Interferometer Pharos Array (IPA) and covered a period of nearly three years. We find no evidence of a photometric or timing correlation between the radio pulsar and the X-ray transient in the same system, PSR J1930+1852. We determine a 2-sigma upper limit of 4.6 hours on the orbital period of the system, which excludes the low-hard X-ray transient as being in a wide-binodal orbit with many long-period (>> 3 hours) flares. The observed properties of PSR J1930+1852 are consistent with a model in which the radio and X-ray sources are in a narrow-binodal orbit with many short-period (<< 3 hours) flares. We discuss this in the context of known LMXBs and the limited statistics available. We find that a simple model in which the accretion disc is treated as a uniform density sphere of the given radius is consistent with the observed data, and we estimate the accretion disc radii for PSR J1930+1852 and five other LMXBs with well-determined radii. The resulting probability distribution function (PDF) for disc radii is consistent with a power law with a high-mass cut-off of 3 solar masses, but we are unable to distinguish between a steep power law ( P Mrad ∝ r-3) and a shallower power law ( P Mrad ∝ r-2) for the mass distribution. The high-mass cut-off in the accretion disc radius PDF excludes a pure Roster matrix model for the mass distribution, but is consistent with a stepped distribution in which the low-mass (<< 3 solar masses) accretion disc is described by a Roster matrix and the high-mass (>> 3 solar masses) accretion disc is described by a random matrix. We discuss the implications of our results for the theory of LMXBs.",
        "To find the perfect off campus student apartment, one should check to see that the apartment has three-pronged electrical outlets in every room, all the appliances work, the locks function properly, there is enough storage space, and that the windows fit properly and do not cause a draft. It is important to also check if the apartment is in a safe location, that the rent can be paid by the landlord or that the landlord can be reached in case of an emergency, and that the apartment is not too expensive. It is also important to research the bus routes in case public transportation is needed, to ensure the apartment is located close to where one needs to go, to see if there is adequate storage space for one's things, and to check if the apartment building handles cable and internet. Additionally, one should check with the landlord if they are responsible for maintaining the building's common areas such as the laundry facility, garage parking space, and storage space for pets. It is also important to check if the apartment building can handle small repairs and renovations, who will be responsible for them in the event something major requires maintenance, and if there are any other students living in the building so that one does not become a disruptive noise during certain hours of the day. It is also important to ask about whether the rent is refundable for a certain period of time, and to ask about the utility bills and who will be paying them.

Get a dog. Dogs bark whenever something strange happens; they're great deterrents against burglars because they make noise and scare away potential thieves. (Plus dogs love people.) 3. Lock everything. This goes without saying, but it's worth repeating anyway. 4. Don't leave anything valuable lying around. Hide jewelry, electronics, etc. 5. Put up \"scare\" signs. These aren't necessarily going to keep burglars away, but they might discourage them enough to try somewhere else instead. 6. Avoid showing off too much money/valuable possessions. Criminals often target houses where there's lots of cash and/or fancy cars parked out; if you're living beyond your means, burglaries could become commonplace. 7. Be cautious when hiring contractors. Never hire any worker whose background checks come back negative. 8. Register your valuables.

        "Oil painting is a beautiful and timeless art form that has been practiced for centuries. If you're ready to try your hand at it, follow these steps to create your own masterpiece!\n\n1. Purchase good quality oil painting materials, the best you can afford.\n\nBefore starting, it's important to invest in good quality paint, brushes, and canvas. Look for artist-grade materials from reputable brands to ensure the best results.\n\n2. Sketch a \"notan\" of the painting in your sketchbook or on scrap paper with a gray pen and a black one, or a pencil and a pen using the pencil as the gray.\n\nA notan is a small thumbnail sketch that helps you determine the composition and values of your painting. Use a gray pen and a black one, or a pencil and a pen to create your sketch.\n\n3. Using charcoal or the pencil, make a value drawing in your sketchbook.\n\nNext, use charcoal or a pencil to create a more detailed value drawing. This sketch will help guide your painting as you move forward.\n\n4. Squeeze out a little of the paint on your palette and mix your colors.\n\nNow it's time to start painting! Squeeze out a little bit of each color you'll be using onto your palette, and mix them to create the desired shades and hues.\n\n5. Paint the color study \"Alla Prima.\"\n\nAlla Prima, or wet-on-wet painting, is a technique where you apply wet paint onto wet paint. This creates a loose and expressive style. Use this method to create a color study of your painting.\n\n6. Draw the outline using a soft pencil or a thin stick of charcoal.\n\nOnce your color study is dry, use a soft pencil or thin stick of charcoal to draw the outline of your painting onto the canvas.\n\n7. Prepare some oil in a cup and some thinner in another one.\n\nTo thin out your paint, use a bit of oil and thinner mixed together in separate cups. This will allow you to control the thinness of your paint.\n\n8. Put a small dab of Burnt Sienna on your palette.\n\nBurnt Sienna is a great base color for painting skin tones. Use a small dab on your palette to start.\n\n9. Remember the rule \"Fat Over Lean.\"\n\nWhen painting with oil, remember the \"fat over lean\" rule. This means that each layer of paint should have more oil than the layer beneath it. This ensures that the paint will dry uniformly.\n\n10. Block in the colors in general for major areas first, then add a little more paint to make details lighter or darker, redder or yellower or bluer.\n\nStart by blocking in the major areas of color, using your sketch as a guide. Then, add in more paint to create variations and to add details.\n\n11. Oil paints stay wet for days!\n\nRemember, oil paints take a long time to dry. Be patient and allow your painting to dry completely before working on it further.\n\n12. Leave it to dry.\n\nWhen you're done painting for the day, leave your canvas to dry in a safe location where it won't be disturbed.\n\n13. One of the traditional Old Masters techniques doesn't rely much on brush textures.\n\nThe Old Masters technique relies less on brush textures and more on the layering of colors. Try this technique to achieve a smooth and blended finish.\n\n14. When you finish a day's painting session, clean your brushes by dipping them in the thinner and then use the painting rag to squeeze the paint out of them.\n\nAfter each painting session, be sure to clean your brushes thoroughly to keep them in good condition.

        "Music royalties are payments collected by songwriters and composers for the right to use a song they have created. Music royalties are collected when a song is used publicly, such as at a live performance, on the radio or in a streaming service. Music royalties can also be collected overseas in different territories. \n\nMusic royalty payments are usually split among several people, some of which include the songwriter, performer, and the publisher of the song. A royalty is typically a percentage of the proceeds of sales of the music. For example, someone who buys a download of a song will have a portion of their purchase go towards the royalty payments. \n\nThe amount of money someone gets in royalties depends on a number of factors, including the type of usage (live performance or radio play, for example), the number of people who have bought the song, online streaming revenue, and sales of the song’s album. \n\nComposers don't get a check each week or month for life for a hit song. They receive royalty payments depending on the agreements for their songs with the record label, publisher, and other music rights owners. \n\nThe amount of royalties earned for a hit song can vary greatly, but it typically depends on how popular a song becomes. A hit song might generate six to seven figures per year in royalties while other songs may be generating far less significant amounts. Billboard Hot 100 songs usually generate significantly higher royalties due to their popularity, with the average hit song netting roughly $10,000 to $15,000 each year. \n\nWhen income from royalties is generated from plays, downloads, and streams, the money is split among the songwriters (lyrics and music) and the publisher for their share of the songwriting. They will then receive a royalty check each time their music is used, paid quarterly by a performance rights organization like ASCAP or BMI. \n\nRoyalties also play an important role in a composer's career. By collecting royalties, they are able to make a living off their creations. Without this source of income, many composers would be unable to pursue music as a profession. \n\nOverall, music royalties are payments collected by songwriters and composers for the right to use their song, typically a percentage of the profits of the song based on where it's being used. The amount of royalties earned for a hit song can vary greatly, but it typically depends on the popularity of",

        "How to Crochet a Sock That Fits'\n\nCreating a comfortable sock that fits perfectly can be a tricky task. In order to crochet an item of clothing that actually fits, the first step is to take measurements of the person’s foot and leg. This ensures that any item created will fit the person tightly, giving a better, more secure fit when worn. Read on to learn how to crochet a sock that fits perfectly. \n\nBefore starting the sock, record all the necessary measurements. Measure the length and width of the foot, such as 9.5 inches (24.1 cm) in length and 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) in width. The length of the heel can be worked out from the width of the foot, so record 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) divided by 2, which gives you 1.75 inches (4.4 cm). To work out the length of the sock, subtract the length of the heel from the length of the foot, which gives you 7.75 inches (19.7 cm).  \n\nOnce the measurements are recorded, it’s time to get crocheting. Begin by crocheting in continuous rows around the sock to form a cylinder. This forms the base of the sock, and the height can be changed depending on the amount of rows you crochet.  \n\nNow the toe can be crocheted. This section of the sock should be a slightly more oval shape than the rest of the sections, and should taper in slightly. It is also important to record the measurements of this section, such as 4 rows in length and 28 sc around the oval. \n\nContinue crocheting the foot, following the measurements you took when measuring the foot. As this is the main body of the sock, it should be worked in a cylindrical shape with the same measurements as the body of the foot. Record the measurements for this section which could be 30 rows in length and 28 sc around the sock. \n\nNext comes the heel. Crochet 14 sc decreasing down to 10 sc to start shaping the heel. Once the heel is complete, fasten off the yarn. Record the measurements of the heel so that they can be replicated later when completing the other sock. \n\nThen stitch the sides of the heel, making sure that the stitches are even and the sock fits well. After this, continue to crochet the calf section of the sock. Record the measurements for this section, such as 10 rows in length and 28 sc around the sock. Finally, crochet the cuff section around the top of the sock. As with the other sections, record the measurements of the cuff, such as 5 rows in length and 28 sc around the sock. \n\nOnce the first sock is completed, it is now time to make the second identical sock. Repeat all of the steps that you completed for the first sock and ensure that all measurements are exactly the same. \n\nBy following the above steps, you can confidently create a well-fitting sock that’s comfortable and secure when worn. The key to success lies in taking and accurately recording all of the necessary measurements before beginning to crochet. With those measurements recorded, your socks are guaranteed to fit perfectly.",
        "\n\nWhen your fingers or toes \"fall asleep\" — a sensation you might get after sitting in an awkward position or falling asleep with your arm under your head — it's not actually because of sleep. It's the result of temporary nerve compression. The nerves in your fingers and toes are compressed, which means they're being squeezed. And that's what makes them feel tingly and numb. Usually, once you change positions and the compression is relieved, your fingers or toes \"wake up\" again.\n\nWhen you have poor circulation, it means your blood isn't flowing as well as it should. It could be the result of something as simple as sitting for too long in one position (that's the case with your fingers and toes) or it could be a symptom of a more serious condition. If your blood isn't flowing well, it means your cells aren't getting the oxygen and nutrients they need. That can lead to all sorts of problems, like pain and tingling.\n\nIf you have poor circulation in your fingers or toes, you might notice that they're cold to the touch, or that they change color. They could also be numb, painful, or weak. You might also notice that your fingers or toes feel tingly. That's a sign that your nerves are being compressed, and it's a symptom of poor circulation. If you have poor circulation, it's important to see a doctor.",
        "\nBy using N-body simulations in the context of LCDM cosmology, this study explores the varying properties and alignment of dark matter haloes with the large-scale structure in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids since redshift z=1. Results indicate that after normalizing the halo mass with M*, the mass scale collapsing at z, there is no further noticeable evolution. Additionally, a dependence on environment is manifest for haloes with masses below M* at all redshifts. The most evident observation is a substantial alignment of halo spin and shape with the filaments and sheets. In particular, haloes in clusters were identified as more oblate below M* while above the same scale they are usually more prolate. Furthermore, those in filaments have a higher spin rate in comparison with masses of similar size in clusters, voids contain the lowest spin parameters and halo formation times were discovered to be altered in correlated to their locations. Finally, the evidence from this work suggests that the threshold of M* likely marks the starting point of the LSS environment in influencing or even reversing the attributes of DM haloes over the measured redshift range of 0 < z < 1.",
        "How to Fix a Flapper on a Toilet Lift the top off the tank of the toilet carefully and set it somewhere where it won’t get broken. Look inside the toilet tank. Flush the toilet as you watch what happens inside. Replace the chain or wire on the lift bar if the flapper doesn’t lift off the hole and you can see they are unattached. Untangle any kinks in a flapper chain if it isn’t fitting back into hole after a flush. Adjust the length of the flapper chain so that it doesn’t flop into the hole with the flapper, preventing it from sealing. If it's a wire, move the wire connected to a flapper to a different hole in the bar to see if that corrects the problem. Flush the toilet again to see if the problem is solved. Adjust the float adjustment screw if the flapper does fit into the hole but water rises over the overflow tube and continues to trickle over it. Turn off the water to the toilet if none of the above fixes the problem. Flush the toilet to empty the tank after the water is off. Lift the flapper and clean the edge of the hole and just inside it, first with a cloth, then lightly with a scouring pad. Turn the water back on and flush the toilet to observe your work. If the flapper ball continues to let water leak after adjustment, you will probably need to replace it.",
        "Okay, so you know those funny-looking things that appear in your URLs sometimes? The ones that look like %20? Well, those are actually there to represent a space. A URL is basically just an address that tells your web browser where to go to find a specific file. And just like with any other address, spaces are important. But the problem is, spaces aren't allowed in URLs. That's because spaces are considered special characters, and special characters can cause all kinds of problems when it comes to computer code.\n\nSo to get around this problem, web developers came up with a clever solution. They decided to use something called percent-encoding. Basically, percent-encoding involves converting special characters like spaces into a format that can be easily read by computers. And the way that they do this is by taking the ASCII code for the space (which is 32) and converting it to hexadecimal (which is base-16). So the hexadecimal code for 32 is 20, and that's why you see %20 in URLs instead of spaces.\n\nNow, you might be wondering why they didn't just use a dash or an underscore or some other character instead of %20. And the answer is, they could have. But using %20 has several advantages. For one thing, it's easy to remember (at least compared to something like %2D). And for another thing, it's universal. Every web browser understands %20, so no matter where you are in the world, you can use it to represent a space in your URLs. So that's why you see %20 in URLs to represent a space. It's just a simple, elegant solution to a tricky problem!",
        "\n\nWe present a statistical study of the polarimetric properties of 15 active galactic nuclei (AGN) observed at high frequencies (20-40 GHz) using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) 10-element digital array. We find that the nuclear polarization is correlated with other nuclear properties such as the continuum flux and the Fanaroff-Riley classification (F-R), but the correlations are not strong. We show that the largest polarization values are found in galaxies with very low neutral hydrogen content, which could indicate that the low-frequency (1-10 GHz) polarization is produced in the accretion disc and the high-frequency polarization is produced in the inner part of the broad line region. We also show that the relative angle between the polarization vectors of the radio continuum and the polarized broad line region emission is on average 90 deg, which could indicate that the two sets of emission are produced in spatially distinct regions. The observed distributions of the angle between the polarization vectors and the radial distribution of the polarized broad line region emission are consistent with the blobs being spatially random with respect to the host galaxy. We also present a method to retrieve the angle between the polarization vectors from an image without knowing the absolute polarimetric calibration.",
        "Yes, continental drift is one of the factors that allows the planet to have a breathable atmosphere, at the very least. Continental drift is the process where slow motion shifts in the Earth's continents across the molten surface results in a dynamic Earth where plates and fragments collide and merge. The movement of these plates is a result of the heavyweight consisting of mostly iron and nickel, which are primarily responsible for the breathable atmosphere we have been gifted in the form of O2 and N2. This slow motion shift is also what helps create the environment for life on the planet. As the plates move they create mountain ranges, deep ocean trenches, and hotspots where volcanoes, some of which formed the oceans, can form. Additionally, this movement also causes weather. Different pieces of land will get closer or further from the equator causing variance in temperature and precipitation. Overall, the movement of the Earth's continents is a very complex system in balance that helps create the environment we know as home. Why? We did not live on this planet long enough for anyone to determine why the continents are where they are. However, there are some strong arguments to why they are where they are. Over time, new evidence has come to light that support these arguments. If we started counting back the number of days since the continents first formed, we will see that they formed as the result of the joining of the oldest land masses on the planet. One theory, which has recently become popular, is called The Fortress of Solitude. The Fortress of Solitude suggests that the continents form a fortress, with the ocean in between, created as a protective measure for the earth. It is suggested that we are now in the late stage of the movement and the continents are where they are due to the fortuitous positioning with the land and the ocean in between. Regardless of the reason, the movement of the continents is what creates the environment we call home.",
        "In this work, we tackle the problem of multiple-antenna beamforming with imperfect knowledge of the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), where the goal is to improve the error performance of the system while maintaining or increasing spectral efficiency. We propose a new scheme, which we call bit-interleaved coded multiple beamforming (BICMBF), that combines channel coding, bit interleaving, and beamforming to achieve this objective. \n\nThe motivation for this research stems from the fact that in practical systems, the channel information available to the transmitter is often inaccurate or outdated due to channel estimation errors, feedback delays, or fast channel variations. Such imperfections can severely degrade the performance of beamforming systems, especially at high data rates, and therefore need to be addressed. \n\nThe key ideas and methodology behind BICMBF involve jointly optimizing the coding rate, beamforming weights, and bit interleaving pattern to minimize the bit error rate (BER) under imperfect CSIT. We leverage tools from information theory, optimization theory, and communication theory to derive analytical expressions for the BER and spectral efficiency of the BICMBF scheme, as well as to develop efficient algorithms for practical implementation. \n\nOur simulation results show that BICMBF outperforms existing coded beamforming schemes for various channel conditions and SNR regimes, and can achieve substantial gains in BER while maintaining high spectral efficiency. Thus, our work contributes to the development of practical and robust multiple-antenna systems for future wireless networks.",
        "Saruman the White was one of the five wizards sent to Middle-earth by the Valar to aid in the fight against Sauron. However, at some point, he became corrupted by his lust for power and knowledge. Saruman started studying the dark arts and became intrigued by the One Ring and its powers. He believed that if he could possess the Ring, he would be able to use its power to defeat Sauron and rule Middle-earth himself.\n\nBut when Saruman found out that the Hobbits had possession of the One Ring, he desperate to obtain it and sent his minions to capture Frodo and the Ring at any cost. However, Frodo and his friends escaped and, with the help of Gandalf, Saruman’s colleague, they managed to avoid Saruman’s forces.\n\nSauron, on the other hand, offered Saruman a chance to rule Middle-earth by his side if he would join him. Saruman, who had already lost his faith in the quest to defeat Sauron, saw this as an opportunity to gain ultimate power and control over Middle-earth. He agreed to support Sauron and began working to find the One Ring and deliver it to his newfound ally.\n\nSaruman’s betrayal led to his downfall. He was eventually defeated by the forces of Rohan and Gandalf, and he died a weak and lonely figure.

        "\n\nPeer Review:\n\nThe paper \"Learning attention for historical text normalization by learning to pronounce\" addresses the problem of pre-normalization of historical texts to modern word forms using encoder-decoder architectures. The authors propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) architecture that uses a grapheme-to-phoneme dictionary as auxiliary data to address the issue of limited training data, which is not available for the named task. The paper pushes the state-of-the-art by an absolute 2% increase in performance and analyses the induced models across 44 different texts from Early New High German.\n\nOne of the main strengths of the paper is the use of MTL to address the problem of pre-normalization of historical texts. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the induced models and observe that, as previously conjectured, MTL can learn to focus attention during decoding in ways remarkably similar to recently proposed attention mechanisms. This is an important step towards understanding how MTL works, which makes the paper a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing.\n\nHowever, one of the weaknesses of the paper is the limited scope of the study, which focuses solely on historical texts in Early New High German. It would be interesting to see if the proposed approach can be applied to other languages and time periods as well. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach and possible future work.\n\nIn summary, the paper provides a novel approach to the problem of pre-normalization of historical texts using MTL and a grapheme-to-phoneme dictionary. The authors present a detailed analysis of the induced models and observe that MTL can learn to focus attention during decoding in ways similar to attention mechanisms. Further research is needed to address the limitations of the proposed approach and explore its applicability to other languages and time periods. Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing.",
        "Thyroid disorders are common among adults and can result in a range of symptoms and health complications if left untreated. A vital step in diagnosing thyroid problems is to read and interpret your thyroid test results accurately. If you have recently undergone a thyroid test, here's how to read your results:\n\n1. Check to see if your TSH reading is in the normal range. The normal range for TSH is 0.4 to 4.0 milli-international units per liter (mIU/L), but this can vary depending on your age and gender. If your TSH reading is within this range, it indicates that your thyroid gland is functioning correctly.\n\n2. Interpret the possible meanings of a high TSH reading. If your TSH reading is above the normal range, you may have an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). TSH tells the thyroid to produce more T4 and T3, which are the hormones released from the thyroid (at the command of TSH) to act throughout the body.\n\n3. Look out for signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. In addition to a high TSH reading, hypothyroidism also presents with many clinical indications, such as fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, and constipation.\n\n4. Evaluate the possible meaning of a very low TSH reading. On the other hand, if you have a very low TSH reading, it may be your body's response for your pituitary to produce less TSH due to an excess of thyroid hormone in the body (T3 and T4). This may indicate an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism).\n\n5. Take note of signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism presents with many clinical indications, in addition to a low TSH reading, such as weight loss, increased heart rate, anxiety, and tremors.\n\n6. Use your TSH value to monitor ongoing thyroid treatment. If you have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder and are receiving ongoing treatment for it, your doctor will likely advise that you receive regular TSH tests to check on and confirm the effectiveness of your treatment.\n\n7. Check to see if your T4 reading is in the normal range. T4 is the most commonly measured hormone that is produced directly by the thyroid gland and is subsequently released to circulate throughout the body.\n\n8. Interpret your T4 value in relationship to your TSH value. If your TSH value is abnormally high (indicative of possible hypothyroidism), a low T4 would support the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.\n\n9. Assess the T3 value in cases of possible hyperthyroidism. T3 is another hormone produced by the thyroid gland, but generally in significantly lesser quantities than T4. Abnormally high levels of T3 may indicate hyperthyroidism.\n\n10. Include your doctor. It is crucial to discuss your test results and any symptoms you're experiencing with your doctor to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n\n11. Interpret thyroid antibody testing to differentiate between various types of thyroid diseases. If you have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder, your doctor will likely order a series of other thyroid investigations to more thoroughly investigate and confirm your diagnosis.\n\n12. Have your calcitonin measured. A calcitonin test may be performed to further investigate thyroid problems and determine if there are any cancerous growths (medullary thyroid cancer).\n\n13. Receive an ultrasound, a biopsy, or an iodine test to confirm certain thyroid diagnoses. While blood tests can provide physicians with valuable information to detect and diagnose thyroid problems, there are cases where more extensive investigations are required to determine precisely what is going on.\n\nReading and interpreting your thyroid test results correctly plays a crucial role in diagnosing thyroid disorders. By understanding the significance of your test results, you can work with your doctor towards proper diagnosis and tailored treatment.",

        "Coffins on Io is an album by the British experimental rock band, The Tiger Lillies. It was released in 2015 on the Misery Guts Music label and includes 13 tracks. Io is one of the four largest moons of Jupiter, and is known for its volcanic activity, which inspired the dark and theatrical themes of the album. The album features the distinctive vocals of frontman Martyn Jacques, who sings in a falsetto voice that has been likened to that of a demonic choirboy. The music is equally unique, with a blend of cabaret, punk, and vaudeville styles, creating a haunting and unsettling atmosphere. The opening track, \"His Teeth Got Lost In The Mattress,\" sets the tone for the album with its references to death and decay. From there, the songs explore themes such as madness, murder, and the macabre with tracks such as \"Twisted Circus,\" \"Scorched Earth,\" and \"The Flame.\" Despite the dark subject matter, Coffins on Io has received critical acclaim for its creativity and originality. The album has been praised for its use of various instruments, including a theremin, accordion, keyboard, and saw. It has also been noted for its use of sound effects, such as creaking doors, squeaky wheelchairs, and thunderclaps. While it may not be for everyone, Coffins on Io is a mesmerizing and haunting experience for those who appreciate experimental music that pushes the boundaries of what is normally expected. The Tiger Lillies have once again proven why they are one of the most unique and interesting bands out there.",
        "\n\nA near-infrared/optical/X-ray survey in the centre of sigma Orionis\n\nWe present a multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic study of the central region of the young stellar object sigma Orionis. Our aim was to investigate the nature of the obscuring material in the outer circumstellar layer and to derive constraints on the mass of the obscured young stellar object. We find that the extinction towards the central star is strongly dependent on the wavelength, with the extinction being lowest in the near-infrared. We determine the extinction to be of order 0.6 in the near-infrared and 1.2 in the optical, with a best-fit model requiring an extinction coefficient of 0.12+0.03-0.01 in the near-infrared and 0.26+0.03-0.02 in the optical. The observed extinction in the near-infrared is lower than expected on the basis of simple models of the scattering by an opaque layer of small particles, requiring a relatively transparent inner layer with a significant column density. We discuss this in the framework of a model in which the obscuring material consists of an inner layer of relatively transparent material and an outer layer of relatively opaque small particles. We derive an upper limit of 1.2 M() on the mass of the obscured young stellar object, assuming that the optical extinction is due to the inner layer only. The mass-limiting radius is 5-10 R(), which is larger than the size of the optically-obscured region but is consistent with the size of the NIR-obscured region. We discuss this in the framework of a model in which the obscuring material is a wind of small particles, with the inner layer being a result of an earlier episode of accretion. We find that this model is consistent with the observed extinction in the different wavelength bands, the position-versity-velocity data, and the relative sizes of the optically- and NIR-obscured regions.",
        "South Gare Lighthouse, also known as Teesmouth Lighthouse, is a historic lighthouse located at the end of South Gare, a man-made peninsula on the coast of Redcar and Cleveland borough in North Yorkshire, England. The lighthouse's primary purpose is to guide passing vessels through the Teesmouth, which is an important shipping lane. The original South Gare Lighthouse was constructed in 1884 and stood 37 feet tall. It was built of brick with an outer covering of stone, and a single revolving light could be seen from a distance of 13 nautical miles. In 1905, the lighthouse was dismantled and replaced with a larger structure made of reinforced concrete. The new lighthouse was designed by Henry Edmund Goodridge, a prominent lighthouse architect of the time. It stands 48 feet tall with a gallery and lantern room, and its light can be seen up to 20 nautical miles away. During its early years, the lighthouse was manned by a team of keepers who maintained the light and surrounding structures, including the fog signal, which was installed in 1907. After automated equipment was installed in the 1980s, the lighthouse was no longer staffed. However, the Coastguard continues to monitor the light and fog siren remotely. Today, the South Gare Lighthouse and its surrounding structures are listed buildings and protected by law. They are also popular tourist attractions, with visitors able to climb to the top of the lighthouse and enjoy stunning panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. Overall, the South Gare Lighthouse is a significant engineering feat of the late 19th century and continues to serve the purpose for which it was built; to provide vital navigation aid to vessels passing through the Teesmouth.",

We show how to construct such models and discuss their phenomenological consequences for cosmology and particle physics. In particular we find that there are two classes of solutions which can be distinguished by whether or not they contain closed timelike curves (CTCs). The first class contains CTCs while the second does not. For both cases we calculate the effective four dimensional Planck mass as well as the masses of Kaluza-Klein excitations on the brane. Finally we study the stability properties of these solutions under small perturbations. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456728. PACS numbers: 04.20.-q; 11.25.-w; 98.80.Cq . \nI. INTRODU CTION\n\nThe idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions has been around since the early days of general relativity [1] , when it was realized that Einstein's field equations admit solutions with extra dimensions [2] .\nIn recent years this idea has received renewed interest due to developments in string theory [3] where it appears naturally [4] . String theoretic constructions typically involve compactification of higher-dimensional space-times down to lower ones [5] - [8] . However, even if one starts out with a ten-or eleven-dimensional background solution, the resulting low energy description will generically include additional fields living in the bulk [9] - [11] . These fields couple to matter localized on the branes [12] giving rise to new effects at low energies [13] - [16] .\nOne particularly interesting feature of many braneworld scenarios [17] - [20] is the presence of time-like singularities [21] - [23] . Such singularities arise whenever the volume of some internal dimension shrinks to zero size [24] . They lead to problems with causality [25] unless the corresponding time coordinate is identified periodically [26] . If this identification is done in a way consistent with supersymmetry then the singularities disappear [27] . Alternatively, one could try to resolve the singularities using quantum gravity [28]",

        " Please write a peer review for the paper of Optimal Binary Autoencoding with Pairwise Correlations, its main content is as below: We formulate learning of a binary autoencoder as a biconvex optimization problem which learns from the pairwise correlations between encoded and decoded bits. Among all possible algorithms that use this information, ours finds the autoencoder that reconstructs its inputs with worst-case optimal loss. The optimal decoder is a single layer of artificial neurons, emerging entirely from the minimax loss minimization, and with weights learned by convex optimization. All this is reflected in competitive experimental results, demonstrating that binary autoencoding can be done efficiently by conveying information in pairwise correlations in an optimal fashion.\nThe paper is very interesting and the results are very good.\nThe paper is very interesting and the results are very good.

        "Hormones have a big impact on the facial structure of all people, even when they are full grown! Hormones are special chemicals that can change different parts of our body, and they work in different ways. \n\nFor example, hormones can cause a person's bone structure to change. This can mean that their jaw and chin are now wider, or their cheekbones are higher. Hormones can even cause the bones in a person's face to grow larger, which might make the person look more masculine or feminine. \n\nIt's also possible for hormones to change a person's skin or eyes. Hormones can cause a person's skin to become thicker, or make their eyes appear bigger. Hormones can even cause a person to grow facial hair where they didn't have any before. \n\nFemale bodybuilders can use various hormones to increase their muscle mass and make their body more toned. This can also cause their face to look more masculine, as their bones can become more pronounced. The same goes for people transitioning from male to female, as hormones can alter their facial features to make them look more feminine. \n\nIn conclusion, hormones can definitely have an effect on the facial structure of a full grown person. This effect can be seen in female bodybuilders or people going through gender transitions, as their hormones have caused changes to their face that are more prominent than the ones that occur in most people.",

We propose an iterative algorithm to solve this problem by using convex optimization techniques, which is shown to converge within finite number of iterations under certain conditions. The proposed algorithm can be implemented efficiently through parallel processing at each iteration step. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes significantly. \n \n Keywords: Power control; Convex optimization; Time-varying; Multiple access channels (MACs); Wireless communications; Iterative algorithms. 1 Introduction \n \n In wireless communication systems, it has been well recognized that the performance of multi-user transmission depends on how the available resources are allocated among different users [1] . For example, when there exist multiple users sharing a common radio resource such as bandwidth or transmit power, the optimal way to allocate these resources may depend on the specific system settings [2] , e.g., whether the users have equal priority [3] , what type of services they request [4] , etc.. Therefore, efficient resource allocation strategies should take into account all relevant factors so as to maximize overall network utility [5] .\n \nIn recent years, considerable research efforts have been devoted to studying various aspects of resource allocation problems [6] - [8] . Among them, power allocation plays an important role due to its direct impact on both spectral efficiency and energy consumption [9] . However, most previous works assume continuous input alphabets [10] - [12] , while practical digital modulation schemes usually employ discrete constellations [13] . As a result, the conventional approaches cannot be directly applied to discrete-input scenarios [14] . To address this issue, several studies [15] - [17] have investigated the power allocation problem over discrete-input channels recently. Nevertheless, their solutions either require high computational complexity [16] or suffer from slow convergence speed [17] .",
        "The study of the rho meson within the framework of the K-Matrix theory was performed for the first time in the framework of the Regge theory of fundamental particles. The role of the rho meson is important for a clear interpretation of pion electroproduction experiments at JLab (Mainz, Buhler, CExchange, and A2). In particular, it was shown that the inclusion of the rho meson in the analysis leads to a considerable improvement of the description of these experiments. The work was performed within the Regge theory, which is a fundamental theory of strong interactions. The Regge theory states that the total cross section of hadrons increases with the energy level in an approximate power-law dependence:. The approximation is good for hadrons with large masses, such as the pions. The Regge theory is based on the assumption that the exchanges between particles in the different reactions have a common pattern, which can be described by the exchange of fundamental particles called reggeons. The reggeons correspond to intermediate states in the quantum field theory between two hadrons. The first description of hadron interactions at high energies within the framework of quantum field theory was developed by G.V. Efimov in the framework of the simple Regge theory. A number of later theoretical and experimental studies of the high-energy interaction confirmed the main assumptions of the simple theory, in particular, the universal character of the exchanges of reggeons. Pions appear in the description of interactions at high energies due to the unique possibility of electromagnetic interaction of pseudoparticles. The SJC (Simple Isobar Model) describes the interaction of two pions with the maximum momentum of each particle limited by the values related to the physical decay channels of pions (soft pions).

When cutting tiles, use a diamond blade on a wet saw set to about 1mm depth per pass.   Always wear proper personal protective equipment during these operations including face shields, hearing protection, dust mask, safety shoes, and preferably even body armour!",
        "\nThis article investigates the development and implementation of a lattice Boltzmann (LB) inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This inverse kinetic theory serves the purpose of constructing a discrete kinetic theory that yields exact fluid equations, which is non-asymptotic in nature. Possible realizations of the theory are provided through asymptotic approximations, enabling the calculation of fluid equations with a prescribed accuracy. As a result, the accuracy of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial compressibility method are discussed.",
        "\nWe have performed an systematic study of the effects of the Y/Ba ratio on the superconducting properties of YBa_2Cu_3O_6+x by altering the Y/Ba ratio in the melt growth process. We found that the critical current density (J_c) plateaus at around 60K for all the samples. The behavior of the in-plane resistivity (r_0) as a function of temperature also plateaus at around 60K. These results strongly suggest that the 60K plateau is a signature of the melting temperature of YBa_2Cu_3O_6+x. To further support this argument, we have compared the temperature dependence of J_c and r_0 for melt grown samples and the sintered samples. For the sintered samples, the J_c and r_0 increase steadily with decreasing temperature, which is consistent with the behavior expected for a normal conductor. However, for the melt grown samples, the J_c and r_0 increase at low temperature and then plateaus at around 60K, and then decrease with further decrease of temperature. The J_c-r_0 characteristics of the melt grown samples are consistent with the s-wave scattering model in which the s-wave scattering cross section increases at low temperature and then plateaus at around 60K and then decreases with further decrease of temperature. These results suggest that the low temperature properties of the melt grown samples are quite different from that of the sintered samples. We have also found that the melt grown samples have a much higher concentration of the CuO_2 phase than the sintered samples. These results suggest that the CuO_2 phase is not thermodynamically stable in the melt grown samples and the 60K plateau is a signature of the thermodynamic equilibrium between the YBa_2Cu_3O_6+x and CuO_2 phases.",

        "In this work, we investigate strong peak points and denseness of strong peak functions. Our study revolves around introducing the notions of strong peak points and functions and exploring their properties. The goal of this investigation is to gain a deeper understanding of these concepts and their applications in function theory and harmonic analysis.\n\nOur methodology involves examining the behavior of strong peak functions and their derivatives in certain spaces equipped with specific norms. We work with the Lp-spaces, where p is greater than one, and we prove that every non-negative Lp-function with a strong peak at a point belongs to the weighted space Lq(μ), where q is the conjugate exponent of p and μ is a certain weight function. We further show that the set of strong peak functions is dense in Lq(μ) when μ has certain regularity properties.\n\nOur work represents an attempt to shed light on the relationship between strong peak points and strong peak functions, as well as their role in function theory. The main contribution of our study is a set of unifying criteria that characterize the properties of strong peak functions in various function spaces. Our results provide insight into the nature of these functions and their applications in topics such as signal processing, approximation theory, and numerical analysis.",

        "Well, dogs and other animals have different types of teeth and eat different things than humans do. They also do not eat as many sugary things as we do. When we eat sugary foods, it can make our teeth weaker and can cause cavities. When we do not brush our teeth, these cavities can become bigger and our teeth can get infected, which can be really painful!\n\nAnimals in the wild also have very different lifestyles than humans. They do not eat processed foods like we do and they have to hunt for their meals. This means that their teeth get cleaned naturally when they eat their food and chew on bones or other hard things.\n\nAs humans, we have to make sure we brush our teeth properly twice a day to keep them healthy. Brushing helps to remove the bacteria and germs that can cause cavities and other dental problems. We also need to floss and use mouthwash to help keep our teeth and gums healthy.\n\nRemember, taking care of our teeth is important for our overall health and wellbeing. So, make sure you brush your teeth properly every day!",
        "In this study, we aimed to investigate the structural properties of uranium-based multilayers. The motivation for this research stems from the importance of uranium in various fields, including nuclear energy and medical applications. Furthermore, the fabrication and characterisation of uranium-based multilayers are crucial for the advancement of nanotechnology and material science. \n\nTo achieve our objectives, we used a methodology that included the deposition of uranium-based thin films via magnetron sputtering. The structural characterisation of the multilayers was carried out using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The obtained results demonstrated an excellent uniformity and adhesion of the thin films on the substrates. Also, the multilayers showed a preferred orientation along the (111) plane of face-centered cubic uranium, which indicates that the films possess a high degree of crystallinity. \n\nIn summary, this study provides vital insights into the fabrication and structural characterisation of uranium-based multilayers. These findings are expected to contribute significantly to the development of advanced materials for various applications, particularly in nuclear-related fields.",

        "In the medieval Islamic world, a woman would have primarily belonged to her father. She wouldn’t have the right to own or control any property, nor would she be able to carry out contracts or enter into legal arrangements on her own. In fact, her presence in court was essentially required for her father to be able to carry out legal transactions on his behalf. However, this changed for some women. Under the instruction of famous women of the era, such as Fatima al-Zahra, Marwiyyah and Asma’s daughter Ruqaiyyah and wife of the fourth Rightly-Guided caliph ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, women began to engage in financial transactions on their own.

        "\n\nHow to Develop an IT Change Management Program\nChange management is essential for any organization that needs to program changes in order to keep up with evolving technologies and stay competitive in their industry. It is a process that helps ensure consistency, predictability, and visibility in system development and other related tasks. The IT Change Management Program (CMP) is a formalized approach to manage all upgrades, fixes, and other changes to IT systems in order to minimize any risk posed by the changes and maintain the performance of the systems. A CMP is developed in seven steps and this article will cover them in detail.\n\nStep 1: Develop a Request for Change (RFC): This may originate from problem management, where an issue, or a series of related issues, is identified and a mitigating change is necessary to prevent (or minimize) future effects. The change request should document all the details of the change including stakeholders, dependencies, and expected outcomes.\n\nStep 2: Obtain Business Change Acceptance: The decision to make a change is typically a business decision where costs vs. benefits are weighed. This approval is documented in the Change Request form.\n\nStep 3: Initiate the Development Project: Development of the change (including testing) is an IT-guided function. A project charter should be developed to document roles, responsibilities and timelines.\n\nStep 4: Pass the Change Management Gate: The Change Advisory Board (CAB) reviews all changes before they can be put into production. The CAB should review all RFCs to determine the scope of the change, risks, supporting documentation and estimated date for implementation.\n\nStep 5: Implement the Change: If the CAB does not approve the change, the reasons are listed (this is always because certain risks have not been mitigated or communications have not been planned) and the development team will be given time to fix those issues and reschedule a meeting before the CAB.\n\nStep 6: Report the Results: Either the change was implemented successfully with no issues, the change was implemented with issues that were corrected during implementation, the change was implemented with issues that were deemed acceptable, issues arose that were unacceptable and the change was rolled back, or in the worst case the change was implemented with unacceptable issues and could not be rolled back.\n\nStep 7: Link Problem Management to Changes: Issues that arise should be compared to the CAB documentation of changes so any unanticipated adverse effects of a change can be isolated. This will help the business make informed decisions about which changes should be prioritized and implemented.\n\nStep 8: Periodically Audit the CMP: At least once each year an audit of the CMP should be conducted to assure that all change documentation is maintained and available. This will help verify that the CMP is effective and that all changes are properly documented and approved.\n\nIn conclusion, an effective CMP ensures that only well-planned, vetted and approved changes are implemented. This prevents any unplanned downtime, compromises to security or quality of service, and ensures that changes pass through an organized structure with a designated approval authority. An IT Change Management Program is an essential element of any organization’s IT infrastructure.",

This dish was created during the 19th century as fishermen would cook their catch over open fires while they were out at sea.   The name comes from the fact that this type of meal has been traditionally cooked using stoneware pots called baking dishes.    You can use any kind of seafood you'd like instead of what we suggest here; however, if you're looking...   For example,...    To make sure everything gets evenly heated throughout, you'll need to build a large enough fire so that there isn't much air between each log.     Once you've finished building up the fire, dig down into one corner until you reach bedrock....     If necessary, add additional wood chips and/or charcoal to keep the flames going strong.    When the rocks start glowing hot, pour water onto them;  this should cause the stones to heat even faster.    Continue heating the stones until they're very hot - you may want to wear heavy work gloves to protect yourself against burns.    After 30 minutes, turn the stones 180 degrees so they'll be facing away from where the fire started.    Keep turning the stones every 10-20 minutes until they've reached peak temperature.    As soon as the stones become too cool to hold comfortably, put them back near the center of the fireplace.    While waiting for the stones to warm again, continue preparing the rest of the meal.    Make sure none of the vegetables touch because they won't get crispy unless they crisp up first.    Lay the potato slices side-by-side across the pan's base, leaving space along both sides of the pan.    Then lay the lobster tails next to the potatoes, followed by the clams and mussels; finally, arrange the corn kernels and sliced onions on top of these items.

        "\nInstalling your own car battery cutoff switch can be a relatively easy process, but there are a few things to keep in mind to ensure a safe and efficient installation. First and foremost, the cutoff switch should be installed on or near the car battery, as it is primarily used to preserve battery charge and for long-term storage.\n\nBefore purchasing and installing the cutoff switch, you should make sure that you have all of the necessary supplies and materials. The supplies to look for when purchasing a cutoff switch include mounting hardware and a fuse.\n\nOnce you have all of the necessary supplies and the switch itself, the installation process can begin. However, before engaging in this process, it is important to make sure that your vehicle is turned off (key position should be placed in the “OFF” position).\n\nTo begin the installation process, you should first disconnect the negative battery terminal (usually black, marked with a “—” sign). Be sure to carefully remove the battery clamp from the negative lead and save it, should you need to remove the cutoff switch at some other point in time. \n\nIt is also important to check the fluid levels in your battery before reattaching the positive lead to the positive battery terminal. Once the fluid levels have been checked, the positive lead can be reattached and tightened securely.\n\nWhen reattaching the negative lead, it is important to pay special attention to the instructions that come with the cutoff switch, as it is important to make sure that this lead is also securely tightened. \n\nAfter you have completed the installation process, make sure that the switch is in the “off” position. To test that the switch works properly, you can then turn on the vehicle and operate all normal functions (i.e. start the engine, operate the headlights, etc).\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the switch works properly, make sure to turn off the vehicle and engage the cutoff switch. It is highly important that you never attempt to start your vehicle with the cutoff switch engaged, or you will blow the fuse that comes with the vehicle.\n\nBy following the directions listed above, you can easily and safely install your own car battery cutoff switch. Doing so allows you to preserve the battery charge long-term and maintain optimal battery performance.",

        "\n\nWe present photometric observations of the remote Galactic globular cluster NGC 2419, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The main aim of our investigation is to study the metallicities of the cluster's constituent stars in order to infer the nature of the primordial cloud from which the cluster was born. Our analysis of the HST data shows a clear difference in metallicities between the cluster's northern and southern subsamples. The northern subsample has a higher metallicicity, with a mean value of [Fe/H] ≈ +0.5, while the southern subsample has a metallicicity of [Fe/H] ≈ +0.6, close to the Galactic value. We discuss several possible mechanisms which may explain this difference. We also present a comparison of the photometry of NGC 2419 with the available optical and ultraviolet photometry of the other Galactic globular clusters. Our analysis shows that the colors of the light emitted by the clusters are consistent with the cluster stars having been born in a cloud with a relatively high metallicity, and being subsequently diluted by a large number of low-mass stars, possibly formed in a molecular cloud with a low metallicity. We discuss this result in the framework of the available chemical models for Galactic globular cluster formation.",

        "There is no set cutoff age for inducing puberty in individuals who did not go through puberty due to medical/genetic causes. Puberty is generally encouraged as early as possible in patients with delayed physical development, as delaying can lead to upset social relationships and issues such as low self-esteem. However, medical professionals generally believe that the physical and emotional changes associated with puberty can be induced in people of any age, provided the patient is healthy enough.\n\nThe process of inducing puberty is actually called hormonal treatment, and it involves providing patients with hormones that stimulate physical changes that are characteristic of puberty. In general, boys and girls are given different hormones depending on the condition, as well as their physical or genetic needs. Hormones that are administered may include testosterone, estrogen, or androgen therapies as appropriate.\n\nImportantly, the benefit of inducing puberty at any age is that it helps with physical development and emotional health. Studies have shown that adolescents who undergo hormonal therapy to induce puberty can have better social adjustment and greater self-confidence. Additionally, it can help improve a person's voice, facial hair, odor, development of pubic hair and genitalia, as well as their physical, intellectual, and emotional growth. \n\nAlthough it is not clear, some research has suggested that there may be potential health benefits to inducing puberty before the \"normal age\". Sufficient evidence suggests that the greater the delay in inducing puberty, the greater the risk of obesity, low bone mass, and even some mental health problems in later life. In addition, there is an increased chance of risk of heart and liver problems as patients get older and progress into adulthood, even if they were to receive hormone therapy at an older age, suggesting that it would be beneficial to induce puberty earlier rather than later.\n\nTherefore, while it is difficult to pinpoint an exact age for the cutoff for inducing puberty due to medical/genetic causes, it is safe to say that the earlier hormone treatment is administered, the better. It is best for a medical professional to evaluate the patient and determine whether their overall health is conducive to a successful course of therapy.",

        "Well, you see, electricity is a tricky thing. Things with opposite charges do attract, but there are also these things called forces that keep those charges from crashing together. It's sort of like magnets – they stick together when their poles are different, but they also push away if they get too close.\n\nThe same thing happens with electrons and the atomic nucleus. The electrons have a negative charge, while the nucleus has a positive charge. Because opposite charges attract, the electrons are drawn toward the nucleus. But at the same time, there's a force called the electromagnetic force that keeps the electrons from getting too close. This force is really strong, which is why the electrons can orbit the nucleus without crashing into it.\n\nNow, there's more to it than that. The electrons are actually moving really fast around the nucleus, and they're also in something called energy levels. It's a bit like a playground with different levels – the electrons can't just hang out anywhere they want, they have to stay in their designated levels.\n\nSo that's why the electrons don't collapse into the nucleus – it's because of the forces that keep them apart. And because the electrons are constantly moving and have these energy levels, they can orbit the nucleus without crashing into it. Cool, huh?",
        "\n\nWe present a method to obtain spatially and temporally resolved dynamics of penumbral filaments in solar flares. We have developed a technique that utilizes the correlation between the magnetic field and the temperature to extract the p-mode dynamics in penumbral filaments. To apply this method, we have developed an automated algorithm to identify penumbral filaments in solar flares. Once the penumbral filaments are identified, we use the correlation between the magnetic field and the temperature to extract the p-mode dynamics. We have applied this method to several solar flares and found that the p-mode dynamics in penumbral filaments can be very different from one flare to another. In some flares the p-mode dynamics is very stable, while in other flares the p-mode dynamics is very chaotic. We have also found that in some flares the penumbral filaments can exhibit a different type of dynamics, which we call modified p-mode dynamics. In these cases, the period of the p-mode dynamics is much longer than the typical periods of tens of seconds. These long-period p-mode dynamics can be very stable, or they can be very chaotic. This new type of dynamics could be due to the interaction between the penumbral filaments and the surrounding magnetic field. Our results suggest that the dynamics of penumbral filaments can be very complex, and can be different in different flares.

        "\n\nThe paper entitled \"Creating Training Corpora for NLG Micro-Planners\" by Gardent et al. addresses the problem of creating challenging training datasets for natural language generation (NLG) models, specifically for micro-planning. The authors present a novel framework for creating data-to-text corpora from existing knowledge bases that provides a data set that is highly diverse in nature and challenging for microplanning models. The authors compare their dataset with a previous study and propose their corpus generation framework as a benchmark for creating challenging datasets for NLG models capable of handling complex linguistic phenomena during micro-planning.\n\nThe strength of this paper lies in its focus on addressing the challenging problem of creating high-quality training datasets to improve the performance of NLG models for micro-planning. The novel framework presented by the authors shows promising results, and the dataset created using this framework outperforms the comparison dataset in terms of diversity and complexity. The authors have also made the dataset available to encourage further research in the field, which is a significant contribution.\n\nOn the other hand, one weakness of the paper is that it lacks detail on the evaluation of the system or the dataset. The authors could have provided more information about the annotations and the inter-annotator agreement, which would have helped readers understand the quality of the dataset better.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper is a good contribution to the field of natural language generation, and the authors present a novel framework for creating challenging training datasets for micro-planning models.

        "\nThe movie Django Unchained is set in the year 1858, a time when bounties were indeed offered for criminals. At that time, many people were opposed to the institution of slavery. Some abolitionists went so far as to fund the capture and execution of slave owners. As a result, slave owners were targeted by bounty hunters.\n\nA famous example is the case of the slave ship Amistad. In 1839, a group of Africans revolted and killed many of the crew on board a Spanish slave ship. They attempted to sail the ship back to Africa but were unsuccessful. They ended up in the United States where they were arrested and charged with murder. The US government wanted to try them and reclaim the slaves, but Spain claimed ownership of the slaves and wanted them to be returned to Cuba. A legal battle ensued and in 1841 the US Supreme Court ruled that the Africans were illegally enslaved and had to be freed. This ruling angered many Southerners who felt that the court had overstepped its bounds and was now telling them what they could and couldn't do with their slaves. The case was yet another factor pushing the South towards secession and eventually the Civil War.",

You should look for thicker pieces of boneless, skinless white or dark meat from organic chickens raised without antibiotics.    The next thing you need to do is lay out two large sheets of plastic wrap over each other on an even surface such as a countertop.     Place both halves of the chicken breast between them and then gently press down until they flatten slightly.    If you're not sure whether you've pressed enough, try lifting up the edges of the plastic wrap to see if they're still sticking to the chicken breast.  Then remove the plastic wrap carefully and set aside.      Next take a sharp knife and slice straight through the center of...

        "\n\nHow to Fold and Care for a Topo Map\n\nA topo map is a map that represents the three-dimensional features of a landscape on a two-dimensional surface. Topo maps are often used by hikers and backpackers to navigate nature. A topo map is usually accompanied by a key or legend which explains the symbols on the map. \n\nFolding a topo map is different from folding other kinds of maps, such as road maps. Road maps are typically folded along the lines of the states, which are not always along the creases in the paper. Folding a topo map along the lines of the states, or along the creases in the paper, can damage the map.  The best way to fold a topo map is along the quadrants, not along the lines of the states. The quadrants are the four corners of the map where the lines of latitude and longitude intersect. \n\nIf you have a map case that allows you to fold the map without creasing it, it is best to keep the map in the case at all times when you are not using it. If you do not have a map case, the next best thing is to keep the map in a drawer or other location where it will not be bent or folded.",
        "In this thoughtful, well-crafted paper, Roman Shustikov and colleagues provide a very nice survey of word2vec, word embedding methods in general, and evaluation. My main takeaway is that there is more to evaluating word embeddings than the simple task of evaluating the word embedding representation of a given word against a fixed list of OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words. For example, a critical question is whether the embeddings capture semantic information, which leads to a second and related question of whether the embeddings are data-efficient: do the embeddings capture semantic information with fewer parameters than if one needed to separately train a larger lookup table? The answer to this second question can have a large impact on the viability of word embeddings for real-world applications (e.g., large model sizes make the embeddings difficult to deploy). The authors do an excellent job of reviewing word embedding methods, the evaluation space, and the related work on data-efficiency.

        "Special Suppressive Antiterrorist Unit (Greece) The Special Suppressive Antiterrorist Unit, commonly known as EKAM, is a specialized unit within the Hellenic Police that is responsible for handling terrorist incidents. EKAM was established in 1978, in response to the increased threat of terrorism in Greece at the time. The unit was initially known as the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit (SAT), but its name was changed to EKAM in 1984. EKAM is responsible for conducting operations to locate, disarm, and neutralize terrorist groups and individuals in Greece. The unit is trained in a variety of tactics, including hostage rescue, close quarters combat, and bomb disposal. The members of EKAM are highly trained and specialized police officers who undergo rigorous training before being accepted into the unit. They are also required to undergo regular training to maintain their skills and keep up with changing terrorist tactics. EKAM operates under the direction of the Greek Police Headquarters and works closely with other law enforcement agencies in Greece, as well as with international partners. The unit has been involved in a number of high-profile operations, including the response to the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. EKAM is also involved in training other law enforcement agencies in Greece and around the world in antiterrorism tactics. The unit has trained police officers in countries including Cyprus, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates. Despite its success in countering terrorism, EKAM has also faced criticism for its tactics in certain cases. Some civil rights groups have accused EKAM of using excessive force and violating human rights in its operations. Overall, EKAM is an important component of Greece's efforts to combat terrorism and ensure the safety and security of its citizens. The unit continues to evolve and adapt to changing threats, and its members remain dedicated to their mission of protecting the people of Greece.",

        " The Calgary Tigers were a professional men’s hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta that existed from 1919 to 1927. The Tigers played in the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) and were three-time Stanley Cup champions. The team was founded in 1919 by the Calgary Altadore Athletic Club and was composed of former players of the Big Four senior teams in Calgary: the Calgary Wanderers, Calgary Canucks, Calgary Royals, and Calgary Shamrocks. The team held their first practice and played their first game on December 7, 1919, against the University of Alberta. The team’s first coach was Hugh Lehman, a former Stanley Cup champion goaltender with the Vancouver Millionaires. The Tigers quickly became one of the best teams in the WCHL. They made it to the playoffs in their first season and won the championship in 1923, defeating the Regina Capitals in five games. The 1923 championship was the first of three consecutive WCHL titles. The Tigers won the Stanley Cup in 1924, 1925, and 1926. In 1924 they defeated the Montreal Canadiens in a two-game, total goal-series. The next year they defeated the Victoria Cougars in the finals and in 1926, they beat the Ottawa Senators in a best-of-five series. In 1927, financial difficulties forced the team to disband and many of the players moved to the newly founded Boston Bruins. The Tigers, however, left a lasting legacy in Calgary as they had demonstrated the city’s potential to be an excellent hockey market. Furthermore, the franchise helped to establish the WCHL as a major force in professional hockey. As a result of their impact, the Tigers are remembered as one of the seminal teams of the early days of Canadian professional hockey. The team was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1945 and to the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 1969. The team’s former mascot, a tuxedo-clad tiger, remains an iconic symbol in the city of Calgary.",
        "This is a fascinating and timely question that has perplexed anthropologists and historians alike. While there are no definitive answers to this question, we can speculate on the reasons why it took so long for civilizations to form and progress. \n\nOne reason is that early human populations were too dispersed geographically and existed in small groups, making it easier to survive through hunting and gathering rather than attempting to stay in one place and cultivate crops. Additionally, it’s possible that the environmental changes that occurred during this era made some parts of the world unsuitable for any kind of civilization due to a lack of natural resources necessary for survival. It is possible that at times, humans were challenged to simply survive, let alone build a complex civilization. \n\nSome experts also suggest that the general populations of humans before the 10,000-year mark did not possess the behavioral or cognitive capacity to form a unified society. This is supported by anthropological evidence that suggests more advanced social interaction and problem solving skills did not become common until the start of the Neolithic Revolution. \n\nIn addition to the inherent complexity of civilization, there are also ethical considerations to take into account as to why civilization would progress at different times in different cultures throughout history. Beyond the biological, technological and conservation constraints of civilization, cultural forces such as religion, politics, and interpersonal relationships could have presented obstacles or pathways in certain parts of the world or certain groups of people. Today, we can see this playing out in some of the more controversial areas, such as immigration and cultural assimilation practices. \n\nFinally, some argue that the wave-like evolution and divergence of human beings had an effect on when and why civilizations emerged in certain parts of the world. It is controversial, but some researchers have suggested that early civilizations developed in parts of the world where the population was comprised of genetically similar individuals. This could be a result of migration from a prior core location, which could explain why civilizations originated only 10,000 years ago when anatomically modern humans have existed for 200,000 years. \n\nUltimately, this is a complex subject that spans across many aspects of human nature and deserves further exploration. We can use evidence from genetics, anthropology, history, and science to form tentative conclusions, but only time and further exploration will give us more definitive answers.",
        "\n\nWe investigated the optical properties of Er3+ doped alkali-chloro phosphate glasses for optical amplifiers. The glasses were synthesized by a conventional melt quenching method. The microstructure of the glasses was examined by transmission electron microscopy, and the presence of a high density of defects, such as vacancies and non-bridging oxygen holes, was observed. The Er3+ doped glasses were found to be thermally stable after melting and quenching. The glass transition temperature was determined to be 434 K, and the temperature corresponding to 10% of the glass decomposition was 632 K. The relative amount of glass decomposition was measured to be 5.0% after heating for 72 h at 632 K. The thermal expansion coefficient was found to be 85 × 10−7 K−1. The optical transmission spectra of the Er3+ doped glasses were measured, and the results showed that the glasses were transparent in the visible region and the near-infrared region. The measured glass refractive indices were 1.5972, 1.5958, 1.5955, and 1.5949 for glasses with Er3+ concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mole %, respectively. The absorption spectra of the glasses were measured and the results showed that the glasses exhibited a strong absorption band around 1.5 μm and a weak absorption band around 0.8 μm. The relative intensities of the 0.8 μm and 1.5 μm absorption bands were measured to be 1:1.5 for the glass with Er3+ concentration of 0.5 mole %, 1:2.5 for the glass with Er3+ concentration of 1.0 mole %, 1:3.5 for the glass with Er3+ concentration of 2.0 mole %, and 1:4.0 for the glass with Er3+ concentration of 4.0 mole %, respectively. The obtained results showed that the glasses were suitable for the preparation of optical amplifiers for optical communication systems.",

        "\nIn this work, the minimum expected distortion under delay constraints of a Gaussian source transmitted over a slowly fading channel has been investigated. Using layered broadcast coding with successive refinements, the receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the channel and reconstructs the source up to some distortion while the transmitter, who possesses no channel state information (CSI), allocates a variable power over each layer. The optimal power distribution that yields the minimum expected distortion, in the limit of an infinite number of layers, was determined by solving a set of linear differential equations related to the density of the fading distribution. Results showed that as the SNR increases, power is allocated to the lower layers; meanwhile, with diminishing bandwidth ratio (channel uses per source symbol), the optimal power distribution converges to that maximizing the expected capacity. While the expected distortion can be improved by either acquiring CSI or increasing diversity, the performance gains of diversity surpassed those of CSI at high SNR, most notably when the bandwidth ratio was large.",

        "Epitaxial thin films of multiferroic Bi2FeCrO6 with B-site cationic order were grown by a pulsed laser deposition technique. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The films were found to have a ferromagnetic order at the B-site, with a ferromagnetic order at the A-site. The ferromagnetic order was found to be a result of the ferromagnetic order in the B-site.",
        "A multi-wavelength study of z = 3.15 Lyman-alpha emitters in the GOODS South Field is presented. Lyman-alpha emission from galaxies at redshift 3.15 is rare, and is one of the most distant light sources known. With the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), tens of thousands of distant galaxies have been discovered, extending the census of the high-redshift universe to higher redshifts than had been possible with previous techniques. These Lyman-alpha emitters (LAE) allow observation of the high-redshift universe during the \"Epoch of Reionization\" and can be used to study the process of structure formation. However, significant uncertainties remain about LAEs, including their number density, properties, and role in the Epoch of Reionization. To study these properties, we combine new imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with existing imaging from the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope, the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope, Subaru, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. Using these data we search for LAEs and measure their physical properties, comparing them to a control sample of galaxies at low redshift. We find that LAEs at redshift 3.15 are lower mass, less luminous, less strongly clustered, and less likely to be detected in HST bands than galaxies at low redshift. These results are in agreement with expectations for population II galaxies at high redshift, and provide new constraints on the LAE population during the Epoch of Reionization.",

        "We present an autonomous distributed admission control scheme for IEEE 802.11 DCF (Distributed Coordination Function) that aims to improve network performance by reducing channel contention and collisions. Our research is motivated by the fact that current admission control schemes are centralized and unable to adapt to the dynamic changes in network traffic, leading to congestion and reduced network throughput. To address this challenge, our proposed scheme employs a distributed approach using a lightweight algorithm that allows nodes to dynamically control their admission requests based on network conditions. \n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our scheme, we conducted simulations using NS-3 and compared its performance against other existing schemes. Our results show that our proposed scheme outperforms other schemes by achieving higher network throughput, lower latency, and reduced packet loss under different traffic loads. Moreover, our scheme was able to adapt to changes in network conditions, providing users with fair access to network resources.\n\nIn summary, our work proposes a novel distributed admission control scheme for IEEE 802.11 DCF networks that addresses the dynamic changes in network traffic, leading to improved network performance. Our approach provides flexibility, adaptability, and fair resource allocation to network nodes, as demonstrated by our simulation results.",
        "In this study, we present the results of our spectroscopic and photometric observations of the pre-cataclysmic variable HS1857+5144, which is a hot and young object located at a distance of approximately 80 parsecs from the Earth. The main motivation for this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of pre-cataclysmic variables, and to investigate the physical properties of these systems. \n\nThe work attempts to solve the problem of determining the nature of HS1857+5144, which has been classified as a pre-cataclysmic variable based on its spectral characteristics but has not yet been extensively studied. We aim to obtain accurate measurements of the object's radial velocity and spectroscopic parameters, as well as to determine its effective temperature and luminosity. \n\nOur key methodology involves the analysis of high-resolution spectra obtained with the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph at the European Southern Observatory (ESO), as well as multi-band photometric data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We performed a detailed spectral analysis using state-of-the-art model atmospheres and synthetic spectra, and derived the fundamental parameters of the system. \n\nOur results show that HS1857+5144 is a hot and young pre-cataclysmic variable with an effective temperature of about 24,000 K and a luminosity of approximately 3 solar luminosities. We also find evidence for accretion activity in the system, which may be related to the presence of a low-mass companion. These findings contribute to our understanding of the evolution of pre-cataclysmic variables and provide important constraints for theoretical models.",

        "Francis E. Brownell, commonly known as Frank Brownell, was an American Civil War hero who served as a private in the Union Army. He is most well-known for his bravery during the Baltimore Riot of 1861, in which he shot and killed the Confederate sympathizer, Robert W. Davis. Born on April 18, 1840, in Hounsfield, New York, Brownell joined the Union Army in 1861 as a private in the 11th New York Infantry Regiment. He was deployed to Washington D.C. in the early months of the Civil War to aid in the defense of the capital. On April 19, 1861, Brownell was part of a small group of soldiers escorting the newly-elected President Abraham Lincoln through Baltimore when they were attacked by a pro-Confederate mob. The attack became known as the Baltimore Riot of 1861. During the chaos, Brownell witnessed Robert Davis assaulting his commanding officer, Colonel Ellsworth, and immediately took action. He lunged at Davis with his bayonet, but it became stuck in the Confederate sympathizer's clothing. In an act of quick thinking, Brownell pulled out his revolver and shot Davis in the chest, killing him instantly. After the incident, Brownell was hailed as a hero and became an instant celebrity. He was later recognized by Abraham Lincoln himself, who personally awarded him the Medal of Honor on September 3, 1897. Brownell continued to serve in the Union Army throughout the Civil War, rising to the rank of captain by the time of his honorable discharge in 1865. Following his military service, Brownell worked as a carpenter and lived out the rest of his life in New York. He died on May 9, 1894, at the age of 54. Today, Brownell is remembered as a Civil War hero and a symbol of bravery and patriotism during a tumultuous time in American history. His actions during the Baltimore Riot of 1861 serve as a testament to the courage of the men and women who fought for the Union cause.",

        "The attitudes and policies of Nazi Germany towards Asians—particularly, Chinese and Japanese people—were undeniably shaped by Adolf Hitler's virulent racism and overbearing nationalism. He and his leading Nazis, who shaped the policies that shaped the Third Reich, viewed Asians as outsiders who posed a threat to the supremacy of the Aryan race.\n\nThe Nazis believed Asians could never be fully integrated into their culture and should not be allowed to live in Germany. During the 1930s, anti-Asian sentiment in Germany was wide-spread, and Hitler capitalized on it in order to gain votes from his increasingly xenophobic constituency. Hitler believed that Asians were not only inferior in terms of intelligence, but also in terms of culture and behavior. Labelling them as part of the \"yellow peril\", Hitler famously denounced the Chinese as \"the most miserable of all nations\" and regularly expressed his disdain towards the Japanese.\n\nTo this effect, the Nuremberg Race Laws proclaimed in 1935 and 1936 created a series of segregated living conditions, restricted rights, and discriminatory treatment of Asian people in Nazi Germany. This included the complete restriction of marriage and sexual relations between Germans and Asians, as well as a ban on Asian immigrants and refugees. Further, the Nazis believed that Asians posed a contagion to the development of the Aryan race and attempted to forcefully assimilate non-Aryans into the Reich by stripping them of any national identity, language, and culture they had.\n\nThe Nazi’s disdain of Asians was also reflected in official policy and rhetoric. German Nazis steadfastly refrained from any collaboration with Asian countries and disparaged Chinese and Japanese people as lower to Aryan people, despite the modernizing achievements in Asia during the time. Ultimately, the Nazis saw East Asians as inferior to the Aryan race and fundamentally incompatible with their German nationalism, concluding any peace-minded collaboration or acceptance would lead to the destruction of German culture.",

        "A Chandra X-ray study of the galactic supernova remnant G299.2-2.9 reveals that the blast wave is decelerated by a low-density, rapidly expanding ejecta shell that has been formed by a previous generation of stars in the vicinity of the supernova explosion. The age of the ejecta shell is consistent with estimates based on its distance from the SNR center and its size. The spectrum of the thermal component of the SNR is softer than expected from a bare shock and can be explained if a population of thermalized ions with plasma temperature of 0.7 keV is present in the shocked ejecta. The large extent of the shell-related emission implies that the progenitor was a relatively massive star that lost a large fraction of its hydrogen-rich material prior to the core collapse. Alternatively, a progenitor mass of 17-22 M⊙ (for a typical explosion energy of 3×1051 erg) would be required if the ejecta is interacting with a low-density intercloud medium. In this case, the total SNR energy input is a factor of 2-3 higher than that released by the explosion.",

        " Yukio Iketani (池谷 幸雄, born July 31, 1960 in Niigata, Japan) is a Japanese professional wrestler and the first Asian to become a WWE Champion. Iketani was also one of the first inductees into the WWE Hall of Fame. Iketani began his professional wrestling career in Japan in the early 1970s, working for Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance (JWA), the promotion run by his father, Rikidozan. He adopted his father's ring name upon his debut and became known as \"Rikki\" Iketani (often misspelled as \"Ike\" or \"Ikeki\" in the West). Like his father, Iketani was a massive crowd favorite, in part due to his imposing height and build, and came to be known as \"The Superboy of Japan\". In 1981, Iketani, along with his mother, father, and younger brother, Tomo, relocated to the United States to work for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), which would later be renamed WWE. The following year, he defeated WWE Champion Bob Backlund to win the title, becoming the first Asian to hold the championship. He would go on to successfully defend the title against the likes of Backlund, John \"Hacksaw\" striped, and \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, before losing the title to Savage in 1985. After his initial title reign, Iketani returned to Japan to compete for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he became a one-time IWGP Tag Team Champion and a one-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion. In 1989, he returned to WWE for a brief period, competing in the 1989 Royal Rumble and going to a draw in a match for the WWE Championship against \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan before leaving the promotion later that year. Iketani has made occasional appearances for WWE since, including at the 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania in 2009, and was one of the first inductees into the WWE Hall of Fame, in 2013.",
        "The paper \"Group Sparse CNNs for Question Sentence Classification with Answer Sets\" addresses the problem of classifying questions into various categories based on their answer types. The authors propose a novel architecture for convolutional neural networks, termed Group Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks (GSCNNs), which allows for group sparsity regularization of the network's filters.\n\nOne of the strengths of this paper is the clear description of the problem statement and the effective use of related work to contextualize the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough analysis of various related models and highlight the limitations of these approaches. This demonstrates that the authors have identified a gap in the literature and have developed a unique solution that can address this gap.\n\nMoreover, the experimental analysis in this paper is well-conducted, with the authors comparing their proposed model with several state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. The results demonstrate that GSCNNs outperform other models considered in the study, which is a critical achievement.\n\nHowever, one of the weaknesses of the paper is that the authors do not provide any ablation analysis to justify the effectiveness of the group-wise L1 regularization. Also, the paper does not address the interpretability of the proposed method, and it would have been useful to include some explanation of how the filters in the group-sparse layer operate.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper \"Group Sparse CNNs for Question Sentence Classification with Answer Sets\" is a well-written and informative contribution in the field of natural language processing. Overall, the results suggest that this is a potent approach for question sentence classification and can be a useful tool in various applications, including question-answering systems.",
        "Tarring and feathering was a popular punishment for alleged wrongdoers, including suspected tax evaders, in the late 18th century and early 19th century in America. Tarring and feathering involved the person being covered in tar and then had feathers thrown all over them. The tar would adhere to the skin and the feathers would stick to the tar, making it very uncomfortable and painful.\n\nThe pain of being tarred and feathered was usually enough to stop the alleged wrongdoer from returning or continuing to commit the crime and it was also a very public humiliation, so it was seen as a useful deterrent.\n\nSo, the logical answer to the question of how people would get the tar and feathers off them would be to, firstly, get the feathers off. This could have been a tedious process as many of them would have been caught amongst the tar and had to be removed manually.\n\nOnce the feathers had been removed, the person would then have to be bathed in warm water to soften the tar so that it could then be removed from the skin more easily. Hot towels were sometimes used when bathing was not possible. Afterwards, the person may need to use a strong soap and oil to help get the tar off completely.\n\nIn some cases, a person too severely tarred and feathered might not have lived long enough to get it all off. In such a case, the tar might have been buried with the body.\n\nIt is quite remarkable to think of the physical and psychological pain associated with tarring and feathering of alleged wrongdoers.

        " Write a peer review by first describing what problem or question this paper addresses, then strengths and weaknesses, for the paper Learning to Repeat: Fine Grained Action Repetition for Deep Reinforcement Learning, its main content is as below: Reinforcement Learning algorithms can learn complex behavioral patterns for sequential decision making tasks wherein an agent interacts with an environment and acquires feedback in the form of rewards sampled from it. Traditionally, such algorithms make decisions, i.e., select actions to execute, at every single time step of the agent-environment interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Fine Grained Action Repetition (FiGAR), which enables the agent to decide the action as well as the time scale of repeating it. FiGAR can be used for improving any Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm which maintains an explicit policy estimate  by enabling temporal abstractions in the action space and implicitly enabling planning through sequences of repetitive macro-actions.   We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by showing performance improvements on top of three policy search algorithms in different domains: Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic in the Atari 2600 domain, Trust Region Policy Optimization in Mujoco domain and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients in the TORCS car racing domain.",
        "Thanks for sharing this paper! The main idea ofdifferentiable interpreter is very interesting and the potential application areas are also very interesting. In the introduction, the authors mentioned that the neural network-based differentiable interpreter can be easily applied to any large neural computation graph, but I don’t quite understand what this means. Can you please explain this in more detail? Additionally, in the architecture of the differentiable interpreter, I think there are also several unclear parts. First, why not divide the keyboard matrix into two parts, one for the symbol table and one for the execution slot table? The separation of these two tables may lead to more efficient computation. Second, in the definition of “deduction”. What does this term exactly mean? I don’t think it is totally clear from the paper. Nevertheless, this work is very interesting and I have some suggestions to improve the quality of the paper. For example, adding some examples to clarify how to use the differentiation API in the example section. The overall comments are positive. Thanks for sharing! Here is an explanation of the differentiable interpreter: The differentiable interpreter is designed to allow the behaviour of sketches to be optimized through gradient descent on user-specified objectives, as opposed to manual optimizations (e.g., constant folding) that are often only achievable by experts with full insight into the program structure. End-to-end gradient-based optimisation of the behaviour allows learning of complex tasks from a small number of program examples. The dual stack machine architecture underpins the Forth interpreter, which allows the incorporation of prior program structure into the model. A sketch can be implemented as a Forth program that uses slots for specifying the behaviour. These are filled with neural networks that implement the behaviour of the sketch. The Forth interpreter evaluates sketches that combine program fragments according to the Lisp syntax, passing the output to the corresponding functions of the slots. The main framework of the differentiable interpreter is as follows: The program is translated into Lisp by the P4interpreter, the front end of the Forth interpreter, which allows a simple and efficient evaluation of the program. The Forth interpreter simulates the execution of the Forth program in the back end. During the execution of the program, the API of the Forth interpreter is used by the user to capture the gradients of the objective function with respect to the behaviour of the sketch. Here are the key differences between the dual stack machine and other neural network-based machine learning approaches: Unlike the key-value memory of DNN, the dual stack machine is more efficient for Lisp-based programming languages because its programs consist of slots that can be filled by specific implementations. The programming languages for the dual stack machine include Lisp and Forth, but DNNs are usually only able to process strings. The third important characteristic of the dual stack machine for practical applications is the partial independence between the program and the model: the model only provides an implementation of the behaviour, but does not change the code of the program. This allows multiple sketches with the same API but different program contents to be incorporated into a model and shared by multiple applications. Besides the Forth interpreter and the Lisp interpreter, another key component of the differentiable interpreter is the API for capturing the gradients of the objective function with respect to the behaviour. Using this API, the behaviour can be updated in an end-to-end gradient-based manner, allowing for more complex and sophisticated sketches. Based on the Forth interpreter and the Lisp interpreter, the Forth interpeter can be viewed as an interpreter for the Lisp-based dual stack machine. The remainder of the paper focuses on the implementation of the Forth interpreter and provides the following implementation details: 1. The dual stack architecture of the Forth interpreter 2. The Forth interpreter tokenizer and virtual lexical system 3. A Forth interpreter interpreter: the Forth-coded interpreter, which is the basic building block of the Forth interpreter The overall process of executing a Forth program by the Forth interpreter is described in Fig. 1. A screenshot of the command line interface of the Forth interpreter The core functionalities of the Forth interpreter are as follows: 1. The Forth interpreter tokenizer and virtual lexical system 2. The Forth-coded interpreter, which is the basic building block of the Forth interpreter The first step is to transform the input language of the user into a Forth-coded interpreter. A Forth-coded interpreter is generated by parsing the input language into Forth tokens and building a Forth virtual lexicon and syntax. Forth concepts are introduced at the beginning of the section about the implementation of the Forth interpreter",
        "In this work, we investigate the relationship between two-dimensional twisted sigma models and the mirror chiral de Rham complex, with a focus on twisted generalized mirror symmetry. Our motivation for this research stems from the desire to better understand the correspondence between two-dimensional sigma models and algebraic geometry, as well as to uncover new tools for studying mirror symmetry phenomena. \n\nTo achieve our goals, we perform a detailed study of twisted sigma models and their associated chiral de Rham complexes, including their cohomology and relationships to other mathematical structures. In particular, we show how twisted sigma models with a certain type of symmetry correspond to specific objects in the mirror chiral de Rham complex. We then use these results to obtain a twisted version of the classical generalized mirror symmetry theorem, which relates the topology of two mirror manifolds through their de Rham cohomology structures.\n\nOur research not only contributes to our understanding of the relationship between sigma models and algebraic geometry, but also provides a new avenue for studying mirror symmetry phenomena. In addition, our work highlights the importance of considering twisted symmetries and incorporating them into our mathematical models. Overall, we hope our findings will inspire further research in this area and shed light on new connections between seemingly disparate mathematical concepts.",
        "In this work, we present the results of modelling and seismic testing of the CoRoT primary target HD 52265. The motivation for our research stems from the need to improve our understanding of the internal structure of stars and their evolution. HD 52265 is an ideal target for this study as it is a main sequence star with a mass of 1.5 solar masses and a radius of 1.6 solar radii. We constructed a grid of stellar models with a range of input parameters including different chemical compositions, which we fitted to the observed properties of HD 52265. We then calculated the frequencies of acoustic oscillations of these models and compared them to the frequencies observed by the CoRoT satellite. By matching the observed and theoretical frequencies, we were able to determine the internal properties of HD 52265 to a high degree of accuracy.\n\nOur seismic tests allowed us to infer the rotation rate and the extent of core mixing in HD 52265, as well as to constrain the age and the extent of hydrogen and helium burning. Our results show that HD 52265 is a relatively young star with a core that rotates faster than its envelope and that the extent of core mixing is less than suggested by previous theoretical studies. We demonstrated that the combination of modelling and seismic testing is a powerful tool to constrain the fundamental properties of stars.",

        "Below is a step by step guide on how to housebreak an adult dog. While adult dogs eliminate inside the house for a variety of reasons it is important to identify the problem so that it can be fixed. First, be aware that there are many reasons why adult dogs may eliminate inside the house. These include recent subtractions and/or additions to the home, fear and anxiety, surface preferences, and elimination triggers. It is important to identify the problem if you want to teach your dog to eliminate in the appropriate spot each time or to even eat meals inside the house. First, check if your dog has any medical issues. This is important since some conditions can cause your dog to eliminate inside. For example, your dog’s anal glands may have drained on the floor where you usually walk your dog. In this case, you will want to clean up the liquid and then let your dog slowly introduce himself to the spot with minimal stimulation. If your dog is frightened by this scenario or suffers from fear or anxiety, he may eliminate in the same spot even after you clean it up. In this case, it is important to work with a veterinarian to treat your dog’s anxiety with anti-anxiety medication if necessary and/or to desensitize your dog to the situation. If the floor is recently cleaned, it is likely that your dog recently ate a meal there. This may make him want to urinate or defecate in the same spot in order to socialize with his species. If you want him to eliminate in a different spot, it is important to work with him on a different surface preference. One way to do this is to work on him eliminating in a crate while you are not there. From this, he will learn that he can eliminate in the crate instead of on the spot where you usually let him out. If your dog eliminates inside because he is frightened, it is important to desensitize him to the trigger. This is sometimes done with training to do tricks or with distractions such as playing recorded dog sounds. Once he is not afraid of the trigger anymore, he should be able to eliminate outside of the house. You can use positive reinforcement training to teach him to eliminate in a specific place or you can train him to respond to a verbal command like “Go outside” or “Go to the door.” If your dog eliminates inside because he has a surface preference, you can work on changing his preference. This is important since the most efficient way for him to eliminate outside is to have a specific spot that he likes. Some dogs have a preference for grass, so you can get cold and/or wet weather gear for him and go for walks on the grass if it is appropriate. If he has a surface preference for concrete, you can start by walking him on a different surface such as asphalt. Then you can increase the amount of time that he is allowed to walk on the concrete by a small amount each day. This will allow him to eliminate outside of the house once he is comfortable on that surface. Once you have identified the problem, the solution, and your dog’s trigger, surface, and medical issues, the steps to housebreaking your dog are: 1. Walk your dog in the same place every day for a few minutes while you observe him closely. 2. If he eliminates, stop him immediately with a sharp “No.” 3. Pick up the elimination with a clean paper or carpet sticker or a clean white cloth. 4. Reward your dog with praise and a treat. 5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a few days until he eliminates on the spot. 6. Extend the time that you walk away from him for a few minutes each day. 7. Soon your dog will be eliminating on command in that spot for a few minutes after you walk away. 8. Gradually increase the time that you are away until you are leaving for longer periods of time. 9. You can then go for longer periods of time without having him eliminate on the spot. 10. Gradually increase the time that you are away until you are leaving for longer and longer periods of time. 11. Soon your dog will be able to eliminate outside of the house without being asked. 12. Go to a different spot if he eliminates in the house or inside the doorframe. 13. Practice this for a few days until he eliminates outside of the house without a problem. 14. Praise him for eliminating outside of the house. 15. Give him a treat for doing the “out” command. 16. Repeat steps 12-15 for a few days. 17. Go on walks outside for longer and longer periods of time. 18. Soon your dog will be ready for longer walks outdoors where you usually let him eliminate outside. 19. Repeat steps",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"On the Connection between Mass Loss and Evolution of C-rich AGB stars\".\nAbstract:\nWe present new results on mass loss in carbon rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars based on infrared photometry obtained with ISO-SWS, IRAS, MSX and Spitzer-IRS. We find that there is no correlation between the total luminosity or effective temperature of these objects and their mass-loss rates. The observed scatter may be explained by differences in chemical composition and/or pulsation properties among individual sources. In addition to this we show that the dust-to-gas ratio decreases towards higher temperatures for oxygen-rich as well as carbon-rich AGB stars. This indicates that the physical conditions at which dust forms are different in both types of evolved stars. Finally, we discuss how our findings can be used to improve current models describing the evolution of red giants. Keywords: Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars; Dust formation; Red Giants; Mass loss. 1 Introduction Carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB; hereafter Crich AGB) stars have been studied extensively over the past decades because they represent an important source class of interstellar matter. They lose large amounts of material through stellar winds driven by radiation pressure on dust grains formed in the outflowing gas. These winds play an essential role in shaping circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars and thus influence the appearance of planetary nebulae and proto-stellar disks surrounding young stellar objects. However, despite numerous observational studies it remains unclear what determines the amount of mass lost by Crich AGB stars. It has been suggested that the total luminosity L * , the effective temperature T eff , the surface gravity g, the metallicity Z, the pulsation period P, and the initial mass M ini might all affectṀ . For example, Wood et al. (1992) , van Loon et al. (1999), Olofsson et al. (2002a) , Knapp & Morris (1985) , and Winters et al. (1994) found evidence thatṀ increases with decreasing T eff .\nIn contrast, Groenewegen et al. (1998 ), De Beck et al. (2010 , and Ramstedt et al",

Because the puppy is unable to eat by itself, it needs to bond with it's new owners by licking them. Puppies lick not only all over their new owners but they also like to lick specific areas such as their eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Licking around the eyes is a way of ensuring that the owners tear ducts are there so the puppy can check for signs of moisture. The nose is another important area to the puppy as it can detect smells which can help it identify it's new home.

        "Xenocyon is a genus of extinct canids that are closely related to the genus Canis, more commonly known as dogs. The name Xenocyon comes from the Greek roots \"xeno-\", meaning \"foreign\", and \"-cyon\", meaning \"dog\". The genus is known from fossils that date back to the late Pliocene until the Pleistocene epoch. The most well-known species of Xenocyon is Xenocyon lycaonoides, which lived in Europe and Asia during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene. This species was about the same size as a modern-day grey wolf and likely had a similar ecological niche. Another species, Xenocyon texanus, existed in North America until the Pleistocene. It was slightly smaller than Xenocyon lycaonoides and is known from fossils found in Texas. Xenocyon likely evolved from an ancestral form of the genus Canis. Over time, these canids developed unique traits and were distinct enough to warrant their own genus. They were likely similar to modern-day dogs in their hunting habits and social behavior. Despite their close relationship to dogs, Xenocyon went extinct around 500,000 years ago. The reasons for this extinction are not known, but it is possible that competition with other canids, changing environments, or a combination of both contributed to their demise. Today, Xenocyon is studied by paleontologists to better understand the evolution of canids and the ecological niches they occupied throughout history. The genus serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of life on Earth and the constant evolution of species.",

        "\nI'm going to give you a partial answer because I'm not sure of the answer. I think the basaltic magma is much less viscous than the more silicic magmas, so it will tend to spread out more as it moves across the surface. That's why the flows from the big shield volcanoes are so wide. As the magma cools, it tends to form long, somewhat rounded, almost sinewy shapes. These flows often move very rapidly, and can carry blocks of solid rock which they pluck from the walls of their channels. When the surface of a flow begins to cool, the movement of the magma is usually not far beneath. The edges of the flow, where they are exposed to the air, begin to solidify. The more viscous interior, however, can continue to move. This sometimes causes a flow to move beneath a solidified surface, which can cause the surface to crack. I don't know if this is what you mean by \"layering\" but I think that is a good way to think of it. I hope this helps.",

        " The 50th Reserve Division (50. Reserve-Division) was a unit of the German Army, in World War I. The division was formed on the outbreak of war in August 1914 as the Reserve Infantry Division No. 50. The division was triangularized in October 1915 and called the 50th Reserve Infantry Division. It was triangularized again in September 1916, when it became the 50th Reserve Division. The 50th Reserve Division was formerly the reserve division of the VI. Army Corps (VI. Armeekorps). The VI. Army Corps had its headquarters in Lille. The division was on the Western Front from the beginning of the war until May 1916. It then fought in the Battle of Verdun. From August 1916 to the end of the war, the division fought on the Eastern Front. The 50th Reserve Division was not just a reserve division in the sense of a combat unit that was not up to the standard of the regular army divisions. It was also a supplementary (Ersatz) division, providing trained infantry replacements to the regular army divisions. The fate of the 50th Reserve Division was the same as that of other reserve and supplementary divisions, in that it was not as well-staffed and equipped as the regular army divisions. The 50th Reserve Division was not as well-established as the other German reserve divisions. It had a relatively high turnover rate during the war. The 50th Reserve Division was not awarded any decorations. The 50th Reserve Division was not a division in the sense of a permanent, continuously-serving unit. It was a unit that was only in existence for the duration of the war. The soldiers were on the front for a few weeks or months, then were sent to the reserve unit to be rested and re-equipped. At the same time, new soldiers were trained and assigned to the division. The 50th Reserve Division was not a national, but an imperial division. That is to say, it included troops from outside of Germany. During the war, the 50th Reserve Division was made up of troops from Germany (35%), Austria-Hungary (30%), France (15%), and the German colonies (10%). The largest group of non-German soldiers were from the colonies of the German Empire. The 50th Reserve Division was thus, in fact, a colonial division.",

        "I think the reason the New Coke didn't work so well was because people didn't like the new taste. It was very different from the old Coke and people weren't used to it, so they didn't like it. I think that's why it was so unpopular.\n\nThe people who decided to change the Coke formula thought they could create a drink that people would like better than the classic Coke recipe. They thought that if they changed it to something that tasted better, people would like it more and it would improve sales. \n\nTurns out, people were very attached to the old Coke formula and did not like the new one that much. It actually made some people very upset and angry. People just wanted Coca-Cola's classic taste to stay the same. The old recipe wasn't just about taste, there was also a lot of emotional attachment to it. People felt like it was a part of their culture and tradition. \n\nIn the end, it cost Coca-Cola a lot of money to bring back the original recipe. But it was worth it since the people wanted it back so much. They listened to the people and heard what they wanted. That's why Coca-Cola is still going strong today with their classic recipe!",
        "\n\nFilling a syringe correctly is essential when administering any medication. Incorrectly filled syringes can be a risk to both the patient and the person giving the injection. Before filling a syringe, it is important to make sure that the supplies, medication, and syringe are in good condition and that you know how to properly draw the medication from the vial.\n\nGather your supplies: A syringe, a needle, alcohol wipes, and the medication you will be administering. When choosing a syringe, you must consider the type of medication you will be administering, as some liquid substances require a different syringe than dry powders. Read the literature provided: Make sure to read any instructions that come with the syringe or medication. This document will provide information on the proper handling of the syringe, storage, and expiration dates. Always examine the medication: After opening the medication package, make sure that the color, clarity, and consistency of the medication are correct. Check the syringe and needle: Make sure the syringe is not cracked or brittle and the needle is not bent or damaged. Carefully replace bent or damaged needles with a new ones. Verify that you have the correct type of syringe: Different types of medications require different types of syringes. Filling a syringe with the wrong type of medication could lead to incorrect dosage or contaminants in the medication. Practice with the safety features of the syringe: You’ll need to understand the safety features of the syringe before you begin using it. Every syringe has different safety features, so practice using the syringe before attempting to fill it with medication. Wash your hands: Before handling any syringes, wash your hands with soap and warm water. Know if you need to gently mix the medication: Depending on the type of medication you will be administering, you may need to gently mix the medication by shaking the bottle to ensure a homogenous mixture. Remove the cap from the vial: Avoid touching the inside of the cap or tip of the bottle to avoid contamination. Pull the plunger back on the syringe: This will draw in air so that the syringe has enough pressure to allow the medication to be drawn out of the vial. Remove the needle cover: There should a cover on the needle that needs to be removed, be careful not to touch the needle when taking off the cover. Insert the syringe needle into the rubber center: To draw the medication, press the needle into the rubber stopper found on the top of the bottle. Push the plunger of the syringe down: This will draw the medication from the vial. Be sure to keep the correct path in line with the needle so that the medication enters the syringe instead of just air. Turn the bottle upside-down: Make sure the needle is still in the rubber stopper of the vial and position the vial so the tip of the needle is at the bottom. Pull the plunger back: Pull the plunger back ever so slightly to pull in a vacuum, allowing the medication to travel up the needle and into the syringe. Inspect the medication in the syringe for air bubbles: Inspect the medication in the syringe for air bubbles, if air bubbles are noticed slowly push the plunger to allow the medicine to circulate and release the air to avoid overfilling the syringe. Push the plunger gently: Once all the medication is in the syringe, slowly push the plunger to remove any excess air from the syringe. Draw more medication if needed: If after pushing the plunger there doesn’t seem to be enough medication in the syringe, you can pull the plunger back again and repeat the steps above to draw more medication into the syringe. Remove the needle from the vial: Remove the needle from the medication bottle and take off the cap on the needle, avoiding contact with the needle tip. Give the injection: When giving the injection, there are a few steps that must be followed. Make sure that the injection site is clean and that the needle is sterile. Use safe injection practices: After a successful injection, dispose the used needle properly and never reuse a needle. Get a sharps container: To dispose of unused or used needles, a sharps container is required. Review your state’s guidelines: Different states have different regulations for the disposal of medical waste, and you must adhere to those rules when disposing of needles. Work with a mailbox kit: Most mail-in programs provide a box or a kit with instructions about how to use the service. Ask your pharmacy about the unused medications: Pharmacies usually have a waste-management disposal system that will automatically track any unused medication that is returned. Explore the available types of syringes: Different types of syringes can be used for different purposes. Recognize a luer-lok syringe: These types of syringes are used for lower viscosity fluids like insulin and contrast media. Identify syringes designed for a specific function: Certain syringes are designed specifically for certain medications. For example, there are “slip tip” syringes that are designed to draw up medication without damaging the rubber stopper on the vial. Know what makes a safety syringe different: Safety syringes come with a shield attached to the plunger, preventing accidental sticks. Identify the parts of a syringe: Syringes come in a variety of sizes, materials, and shapes, but all syringes have the same basic components. Know what the barrel does: The barrel, or cylinder portion, is where the medication is stored after it is drawn up into the syringe. Recognize the plunger: This is the part of the syringe that pushes the medication out of the syringe. Know about the syringe tip: Syringe tips are made of different materials, depending on the type of syringe. Identify the parts of the needle: Very thin needles are used to administer medication and these needles each have three main parts, the cannula, the hub, and the protective sheath. Choose the proper syringe-needle unit: Once you have identified a correct needle, the syringe-needle unit must still be chosen correctly. Know what the numbers on the package mean: On the packaging, the size of the syringe and needle is usually marked as a ratio, such as “1:1.” This number means that the syringe and the needle are the same size. Learn about the types of injections: Different injections can be administered in different ways, so make sure to inform yourself of the type of the injection that you will be giving and study up on the best way to give the injection.\n\nFilling a syringe correctly is essential when giving injections and cannot be taken lightly. Be sure to inform yourself of the proper procedures for handling and filling a syringe and the risks associated with incorrect syringe technique. Doing this will ensure that the medication is administered properly and that the patient is receiving the correct and safe dosage.",
        "Antares is a red supergiant star located in the constellation Scorpius. It is the brightest star in the constellation and the 15th brightest star in the night sky. Its name comes from the Greek word meaning \"rival of Mars\" because of its intense reddish hue resembling that of the planet. Antares is also known as Alpha Scorpii, as it is the brightest star in the pattern of Scorpius. Antares has a radius estimated to be around 883 times that of the Sun, making it one of the largest known stars. It is also one of the most massive, with a total mass estimated to be around 12 times that of the Sun. Antares is estimated to be around 550 light-years away from Earth. Despite its size and brightness, Antares is a relatively young star, with an estimated age of between 10 and 20 million years. Due to its massive size, Antares is expected to end its life in a supernova explosion, although this is not expected to happen for at least a few hundred thousand years. Antares has a companion star, which is much smaller and cooler than the main star. This companion star is difficult to observe directly due to its proximity to the much brighter main star. Antares has been observed by astronomers for thousands of years, and has been used as a navigational aid by sailors and travelers throughout history. In recent years, Antares has been studied extensively by astronomers using telescopes and other advanced instruments in order to learn more about its structure, evolution, and potential for future supernova explosions. Overall, Antares is an important and fascinating star that has captured the imagination of astronomers and stargazers alike for generations.",
        "The power supply is faulty and does not provide enough current or voltage, causing one of them (or both) to be undercharged. This may cause damage if it continues long term. If you have access to another charger that works with your device then try using this instead until yours has been repaired/exchanged by manufacturer. Alternatively use an adapter cable from USB port on computer/laptop as these are usually more powerful than those supplied in chargers. The same applies to wall adaptors - some will only deliver 1 amp while others 2 amps etc., so check before buying! It could also just be a bad batch but it's best to avoid taking chances.

        "The discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus in 1492 was a significant event that drastically changed the course of history. However, the Muslim world's reaction to this discovery was mixed and varied.\n\nOn one hand, some Muslims were intrigued by the discovery of the new world and saw it as an opportunity for trade and commerce. Muslim explorers sailed to the Americas and established commercial relationships with native populations, which allowed for the exchange of goods and ideas.\n\nOn the other hand, there is little evidence to suggest that Muslims attempted to colonize the Americas or bring the Quran to its inhabitants. This is because the Muslim world had already established thriving trade networks that spanned across the globe, and the discovery of the Americas did not present any new economic incentives for colonization or conquest.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"discovery\" was alien to the Muslim world since they had already explored and mapped much of the known world. Therefore, the discovery of the Americas did not hold the same weight or meaning to Muslims as it did to Europeans. \n\nIn conclusion, while Muslims did establish commercial relationships with the Americas following its discovery, there is no evidence to suggest that they tried to colonize the land or convert its inhabitants to Islam. Instead, they saw it as just another potential trading partner in a vast network of global commerce.",

        " Valet Girls is a British television miniseries produced by the BBC and broadcast from 1981-1982. It stars Anna Churcher as the lead character, Caroline (Carrie), a young woman working as a valet for a hotel in London. Carrie is an independent and strong-willed woman who is looking to make her way in the world, but she has a lot on her plate as she juggles her career, her personal life, and her love interest, Mark (Alec Mccowen). The series explores the notion of a \"Valet Girl\" - a term used in the UK to describe young women who worked as hotel and restaurant assistants. The show follows the stories of Carrie and other Valet Girls as they work to find success and survival in a male-dominated workplace while trying to find a way to balance the demands of their job with the complexities of their personal lives. The miniseries, set during the early 1980s in London, contains themes of romance, friendship, and empowerment and challenges gender roles often encountered in traditional working environments. Valet Girls was written and created by BAFTA award-winning writer, Victoria Wood, and also featured acclaimed British actors, Alec McCowen, Mary Healey, and Paul Speller. The series received critical acclaim for its writing and for its successful representation of young women in a contemporary setting. Valet Girls was aired on BBC1 from 1981-1982, and it spawned a spin-off series, \"Valet Girls Two\", which aired throughout 1983 on the same channel. Together, they ran for 25 episodes, and the show has been released on DVD in the UK and Germany. The show is seen as a groundbreaking representation of female strength, ambition and, ultimately, empowerment during a time when female roles on television were largely limited to traditional stereotypes. It continues to be popular with fans today and is a classic example of British television at its best.",

        "In this paper, I argue that quantum mechanics, like other physical theories, can be viewed as a macrorealistic theory that describes the world at a certain level of abstraction. At this level, the quantum world resembles the world described by classical physics. Like classical physics, quantum mechanics relies on generalizations and assumptions that cannot be verified independently. In contrast to classical physics, however, quantum mechanics also requires measurement results to be described by probabilistic laws that are obtained by generalizing the concept of probability. I argue that this probabilistic foundation is the key to understanding why quantum mechanics does not describe certain aspects of the world with sufficient accuracy. I present several examples of phenomena in classical physics that are not adequately described by quantum mechanics, such as the free particle and the harmonic oscillator, and explain how they can be well-described using classical physics if one accepts that measurements in the quantum world correspond to the acquisition of a certain amount of information. Finally, I argue that this information may be expressed using the word “knowledge” or “awareness”, which allows us to connect quantum mechanics to knowledge representation and management in the same way that information theory does. I discuss how this connection may help to find a better theoretical basis for machine learning and artificial intelligence.",
        "In this work, we investigate the connection between star-forming galaxies, AGN host galaxies, and early-type galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our research attempts to understand the relationship between these three different types of galaxies and how they evolve over time. The problem we aim to solve is understanding the role AGN host galaxies have in the evolution of galaxies and their potential impact on star formation.\n\nOur methodology involves analyzing a large sample of SDSS galaxies using publicly available data. We examine different properties of each galaxy, including its morphology, stellar mass, gas content, and level of star formation. We also investigate the presence of AGN activity in these galaxies.\n\nOur key results indicate that AGN host galaxies exhibit different properties compared to both star-forming and early-type galaxies. Specifically, AGN host galaxies tend to have higher stellar masses and lower levels of star formation than star-forming galaxies. However, they also show a higher gas content than early-type galaxies, indicating their potential for future star formation.\n\nIn conclusion, our work sheds light on the complex relationship between star-forming galaxies, AGN host galaxies, and early-type galaxies. The results obtained from this analysis provide new insights into the evolution of galaxies and the role of AGN in this process.",
        "We present a theoretical study on two-photon interactions with broadband down-converted light and entangled photons. Our approach is based on the second quantization formalism and involves a comprehensive analysis of the relevant quantum field operators. We derive the general expressions for the two-photon amplitude and calculate the corresponding cross-sections for different photon states.\n\nOur results show that broadband down-converted light and entangled photons can be utilized to enhance the two-photon process significantly. Furthermore, the spectral and polarization properties of the photon states play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and feasibility of the process.\n\nThis work contributes to the development of quantum optics and photonics with a fundamental understanding of two-photon interactions. The theoretical framework presented in this work is poised for further extensions and applications in quantum information and technology.\n\nThe main problem we aim to solve is to understand the effect of broadband down-converted light and entangled photons on two-photon interactions. The key ideas in our methodology are to utilize the formalism of quantum field theory to develop the theory and generalize the results for different photon states. We believe our work presents a significant step towards developing new techniques for manipulating photon states.",
        "\n\nThis paper addresses the problem of learning domain invariant representations for time series data while transferring the complex temporal latent dependencies between the domains. The proposed model, Variational Recurrent Adversarial Deep Domain Adaptation (VRADA), is built atop a variational recurrent neural network (VRNN) and trains adversarially to capture complex temporal relationships that are domain-invariant.\n\nStrengths of this paper include its novel approach to the problem, which is (as far as the authors know) the first to capture and transfer temporal latent dependencies in multivariate time-series data. The authors also conduct experiments on real-world multivariate healthcare time-series datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of their model in learning domain-invariant representations.\n\nOne potential weakness of this paper is that it does not compare the performance of the proposed model to baselines such as traditional recurrent neural networks or other existing deep domain adaptation approaches. Additionally, the authors could provide more detailed descriptions of the model architecture, as well as more quantitative results from the experiments.",
        "\n\nHow to Cut a Mat Using a Utility Knife\nReady to mat your next painting project or favorite photograph? Cutting mat is a little intimidating, but with the right supplies and equipment, you can easily achieve professional looking results. After all the effort you put into choosing the perfect frame and artwork, you want everything to turn out perfect. Follow these steps to cut mat for your treasured pieces.\n\nStep 1: Assemble your supplies. Gather the following materials: utility knife, mat board (white, pebble surface is recommended), ruler, sandpaper, eraser, electric scissors, pencil, and tape.\n\nStep 2: Find a sturdy surface for mat cutting. You will be doing some cutting with a sharp blade, so ensure the surface is strong. Place a scrap piece of old mat board on the table if you have one, or make sure your table is laid out with newspaper or scrap paper.\n\nStep 3: Use only white, pebble surface mat board. This will ensure you are able to get the best looking cut. Avoid any textured mat board as it wont cut a straight line nicely.\n\nStep 4: Utilize the perfect edges on the sheet of new mat board. You may want to check the edges for any damage before you start cutting. Check for any rips, tears or irregular edges.\n\nStep 5: Cut the piece you will need from the top right or left corner. Start with the corner closest to the straight edge of the mat board, and slowly slide the utility knife all the way across the board. If you need to make more than one cut, it may be a good idea to make them all in the same direction.\n\nStep 6: Chose any brand or grade of utility knife. Many people feel comfortable using a standard blade, instead of a heavy duty, razor type knife. It really depends on how thick your artwork is and the thickness of the mat board.\n\nStep 7: Keep in mind to always protect the piece you will be using for your mat. It is a good idea to have some sort of cover sheet ready, such as a piece of paper or craft liner, between the utility knife and the artwork.\n\nStep 8: When you have finished, take the test the piece of mat board to be sure it fits into your frame. Measure the artwork and the mat board, as well as the frame. You may need to adjust the size accordingly.\n\nStep 9: Place your art work on the mat and visually align it in the center. Make sure that the artwork looks balanced and is aligned in the middle.\n\nStep 10: Use a ruler and measure in from the outside edges of your mat. Draw a pencil line 1/4th of an inch (3-5 mm) from the edge, and draw another line inside of it. This will be where you place the utility knife for cutting.\n\nStep 11: Set your art aside. You don't want to cut over it and scratch the artwork.\n\nStep 12: Cut the corners first. Start at the bottom left or right corner and slowly slide the blade down and inwards towards the inside pencil mark. Pause after you cut a bit and then make sure your blade is still on the line before continuing. Go back and forth on the same line, until you reach the next outside of the mat mark.\n\nStep 13: To cut the mat sides, repeat the steps described above. Start at the side closest to the corner where you started, and cut inwards towards the center. Pause at the center line, check the alignment and then complete the cut.\n\nStep 14: Use sandpaper on rough spots. After all cutting is complete, you may have some rough edges. Sandpaper will help to even the edges out and smooth any sharpness.\n\nStep 15: Erase all pencil lines. This will ensure a neat appearance when the mat is finished.\n\nStep 16: Cut a piece of cardboard to serve as backing. Your size will depend on the size of mat board you’re cutting. You can keep the same measurements as the mat board, or make it bigger if you want a bit more room for error.\n\nStep 17: Fold the mat and backing closed and tape from side to side on the outside to reinforce the hinge. This will ensure that the mat stays in place.\n\nStep 18: Place your art on the backing. Center the artwork on the backing and press it down gently.\n\nStep 19: Set the matted piece into the frame and check to see that there is nothing between the glass and the art, such as eraser crumbs, lint or fuzz. After making sure your artwork is in place, stand and admire your new masterpiece!",
        "The Final Inch is a 1944 British war film directed by Harry Watt and starring George Alexander, David Tomlinson, David Oxley, Irene Handl and Marjorie Rhodes. It is based on the 1940 novel of the same title by Richard Cross, which was later made into a play and a television film. The film takes its name from the closing stages of the Battle of Morogoro, during which Lord Dunmore's Boys, an African unit of the British Army, aided by Congolese auxiliaries, drove the German army to the edge of capture in Mozambique. It was made at Begbroke Studioseque in Surrey and locations in the Thames Valley, and involved some of the crew from documentary filmmaker Glyn Davis's unit, the Empire Marketing Board (EMB). The Final Inch was intended to encourage public support for the EMB's work to publicize the British Empire and encourage donations to its funds. The Hollywood studios were wary of producing it for war propaganda because of its high cost and the negative reaction of the American public to the bombings of civilian populations in Germany during World War II, so EMB spent half a million dollars on its production. Its release was postponed several times, and its cheerful message was more relevant to Britain's domestic scene than to its war effort, although the message of the film, and of the book from which it was adapted, remained controversial long afterwards. Despite this, the film was well received by critics and had a successful release in the United States, Canada and other British colonies. It received an Academy Award for Best British Feature Film, the only film submitted by the Empire Marketing Board to receive an Oscar award. The cast included David Tomlinson (who had played Carpentier in Gone Are All My Relations) and Anthony Nicholls, who went on to play Minoru in the films of the James Bond franchise.",

        "The Overland Trail was a historic route used by pioneers and traders in the mid-19th century to travel from the Missouri River to the Pacific Coast, specifically to California, Oregon, and Salt Lake City. It was one of the main routes used during the westward expansion of the United States, and it played a vital role in the settlement of the western territories. The trail was approximately 2,000 miles long and started in Missouri, following the Platte River through present-day Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado, before branching out to the gold mines of California, or continuing to Oregon. The journey typically took four to five months on horseback or covered wagons, depending on the weather and the season. The Overland Trail was developed after the discovery of gold in California in 1848, which led to a major influx of people looking to strike it rich out west. The route was made possible due to the establishment of trading posts, military forts, and stagecoach stations along the trail, providing resources and protection to travelers. The journey was not without danger, as travelers encountered various obstacles, including hostile Native American tribes, harsh weather, and the threat of disease and starvation. It is estimated that up to 10% of pioneers did not survive the journey. Today, the Overland Trail is commemorated through various landmarks, museums, and historical sites along its route, including the Fort Laramie National Historic Site in Wyoming and the Pony Express Museum in St. Joseph, Missouri. In conclusion, the Overland Trail was a significant factor in the expansion of the United States westward. It allowed for the settlement of new territories and the development of important western cities, as well as the transportation of valuable goods and resources.",

        " Please write a peer review for the paper of Transformational Sparse Coding, its main content is as below: A fundamental problem faced by object recognition systems is that objects and their features can appear in different locations, scales and orientations. Current deep learning methods attempt to achieve invariance to local translations via pooling, discarding the locations of features in the process.  Other approaches explicitly learn transformed versions of the same feature, leading to representations that quickly explode in size. Instead of discarding the rich and useful information about feature transformations to achieve invariance, we argue that models should learn object features conjointly with their transformations to achieve equivariance.  We propose a new model of unsupervised learning based on sparse coding that can learn object features jointly with their affine transformations directly from images. Results based on learning from natural images indicate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of traditional sparse coding but with significantly fewer degrees of freedom while simultaneously learning transformations from data. These results open the door to scaling up unsupervised learning to allow deep feature+transformation learning in a manner consistent with the ventral+dorsal stream architecture of the primate visual cortex.\n\nComment: Please do not post code or data as images.

        "\n\nWe present multiwavelength observations of the shock wave launched by the 2014 Juno mission as it intersected the outskirts of the Tycho supernova remnant. The observations were made with the Subaru HDS instrument as part of the Workshop on Multiwavelength Studies of Supernova Remnants in collaboration with the SUBARU/HiCIAO Subaru Chandra partnership. We find that the shocked gas is dominated by the hydrogen Balmer line, with a strength that varies with the square of the optical depth. This is consistent with an ionization structure in which the hydrogenic ions are nearly optically thick, while the metalic ions are optically thin. We show that a simple model in which the shock energy is deposited into the ionization structure according to the ionization balance in the pre-shock medium can quantitatively reproduce the observed spectral and temporal variations of the Balmer line. Our model also predicts a decrease of the shock strength with the square of the optical depth, in agreement with the observation. We discuss a physical mechanism that could produce this particular ionization structure in a supernova remnant.",
        "In this study, we investigate the age constraints in the double pulsar system J0737-3039. By analyzing the system's orbital evolution, we aimed to determine the minimum and maximum ages of the pulsars. Through this, we seek to address the problem of constraining the ages of binary pulsars, as accurate age estimations are essential for understanding the physics of these systems.\n\nUsing timing observations from radio telescopes, we fit orbital models to the pulsar data and derive the system's age. By considering various model uncertainties, we calculated the maximum and minimum ages of the pulsars. Our study reveals that the binary system had a minimum age of 85 million years and a maximum age of 210 million years. These results are consistent with previous age estimations for both pulsars.\n\nOur study's key idea is that age constraints placed on binary pulsars provide valuable insight into the binary's formation and evolution, as well as their resultant gravitational wave emission. These determinations aid in understanding pulsar evolution and the fundamental physics of neutron stars.\n\nIn conclusion, our work places constraints on the ages of the double pulsar system J0737-3039, with implications for our understanding of binary pulsar formation and evolution. Overall, these age estimates provide insight into the complex dynamics of these fascinating systems.",
        "In this study, we aimed to experimentally test non-local realism, which is a theoretical concept that states that physical systems cannot have instantaneous interactions over vast distances. This concept is crucial in understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics and its relevance in explaining the strange quantum phenomena.  Our experiment aimed to investigate whether these non-local interactions exist or whether there are alternative explanations for these phenomena, as proposed by local realism. \n\nThe methodology involved the use of Bell's inequality test, which states that local realism imposes a limit on the correlations between the measurements of two physically distant systems. By generating entangled photon pairs and measuring their polarization properties, we tested the Bell inequality. Our results showed that the correlations between the measurements are non-local, inconsistent with the predictions of local realism, and in line with the predictions of quantum mechanics.\n\nThese results have significant implications for our understanding of the nature of reality and the limitations of classical physics in explaining quantum phenomena. By further developing such experiments, we can shed more light on the mysterious and complex nature of quantum mechanics, and potentially pave the way for new quantum technologies.",
        "\nInstead of viewing the scheduler as an adversary, who may try to undermine safety properties of protocol models, we look at a restricted class of admissible schedulers. These are schedulers which are only able to react to previous behaviour of the system which is visible to the adversary. From this perspective, we propose a probabilistic definition of anonymity: the identity of users and the observations of the adversary are independent random variables that can only be affected by the prior behaviour of the system. To demonstrate anonymity, a proof technique of 'exchange' can be used wherein two users' behaviours can be swapped without the adversary 'noticing'.",

        "Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGNs) are believed to be the fueling depots of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with less amounts of matter compared to their high-luminosity counterparts. Recently, there have been claims for enormous growth in the mass of SMBHs in LLAGNs. These claims are based on the theory of Generalized Stellar Structure (GSS), where the central supermassive black hole (CMBH) undergoes rapid accretion of low-angular momentum material onto its horizon. The theory is highly speculative and lacks comprehensive physical basis. We develop a new model for LLAGN fueling that is based on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes rather than the rarely observed direct capture of material into the CMC. In this scenario, jets generated by the CMC (unlike those from SMBHs) drive disk accretion onto the SMBH. Disk particles, unable to overcome the centrifugal barrier, radially outflow. The inflow rate is determined by the balance between the pressure of the outflow and the force of gravity. We show that such accretion flow can result in slow and gentle growth of the SMBH, without the need for sudden rapid inflows.",

        "\nThis paper addresses the problem of modelling relational time series data using Gaussian embeddings. The main strength of this paper is that it proposes a new way to model relational data using Gaussian embeddings. This is a novel approach that has not been widely used in the literature. The paper also shows that this approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on a variety of relational data sets. However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. First, the paper does not provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on modelling relational data. This makes it difficult to understand the context of the paper and how it fits into the wider research area. Second, the experimental results in the paper are not well-controlled. For example, the paper does not report the average runtime of the methods compared, which is important for evaluating the efficiency of the methods. Finally, the paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed approach or how it could be improved in the future.",
        "How to Find a Caterpillar\n\nCaterpillars are fascinating creatures, and finding them can be a fun and educational experience. If you want to find caterpillars, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, you need to know which types of butterflies are native to the region in which you live. You also need to familiarize yourself with the different host plant types that caterpillars feed on. In addition, it’s essential to be able to identify the different types of caterpillars and know what to look for when searching for them. Finally, you must know how to handle caterpillars safely and how to care for them.\n\nPart 1: Finding Caterpillars in the Wild\n\n1. Learn which types of butterflies are native to the region in which you live.\n\nBefore you start looking for caterpillars, you need to know which types of butterflies are native to your area. This will give you an idea of the type of caterpillars you can expect to find. Check with a local nature center or butterfly garden for information on native butterfly species in your region.\n\n2. Know the different host plant types.\n\nDifferent butterfly species lay their eggs on different host plants. For example, monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed plants. Knowing which types of host plants to look for will increase your chances of finding caterpillars.\n\n3. Familiarize yourself with what different types of caterpillars look like.\n\nDifferent caterpillar species look different, so it’s important to know what to look for when searching for caterpillars. Look up pictures of caterpillars online and familiarize yourself with the different types.\n\n4. Ensure that it’s the right season.\n\nButterflies lay their eggs in different seasons. Knowing when the eggs are laid and when they hatch can help you determine when to look for caterpillars.\n\n5. Go to a nearby area in which the host plants for local butterfly species generally thrive.\n\nOnce you know which host plants to look for, head to a nearby area where these plants typically grow. This could be a nature park, butterfly garden, or other natural area.\n\n6. Look for eggs or caterpillars on the leaves and flowers of host plants.\n\nButterfly eggs are small and hard to find, but they are usually found on the undersides of leaves. Caterpillars feed on the leaves and flowers of host plants, so look carefully for them among the foliage.\n\n7. Look on the undersides of leaves that contain holes.\n\nSometimes, caterpillars eat holes in the leaves of host plants. If you see leaves with holes in them, look on the undersides of the leaves for caterpillars.\n\n8. Stand beneath host trees and shrubs and look up for hanging caterpillars.\n\nSome caterpillars hang from leaves or branches when they molt. Look up at the host plants and check for caterpillars hanging from them.\n\n9. Wash your hands.\n\nIf you handle caterpillars, be sure to wash your hands afterward. Caterpillars can carry bacteria, and some species can be poisonous.\n\n10. Be gentle.\n\nIf you plan to touch a caterpillar, be very gentle. Caterpillars are fragile, and their bodies can be easily damaged.\n\n11. Don’t pull on caterpillars.\n\nNever pull on a caterpillar or try to force it off of a plant. Doing so can harm the caterpillar or damage the plant.\n\n12. Avoid caterpillars with branching spines.\n\nSome caterpillars have branching spines that can be painful or dangerous if touched. Be sure to avoid these types of caterpillars.\n\n13. Know how to treat caterpillar stings.\n\nIf you are stung by a caterpillar, you can use adhesive tape to remove any broken spines from the sting area. Then, try washing the area with soap and water to remove the venom and reduce irritation.\n\nPart 2: Caring for Your Caterpillar\n\n1. Choose a container for your caterpillar to live in.\n\nIf you plan to keep a caterpillar as a pet, you will need to provide it with a container to live in. A plastic or glass container with a lid is ideal.\n\n2. Add sticks to the container.\n\nCaterpillars need sticks or branches to climb on, so be sure to add them to the container. Make sure the sticks are clean and free of any pesticides or other chemicals.\n\n3. Feed the caterpillar the correct plants.\n\nEach caterpillar species has its own preferred host plants. Do some research to find out which plants your caterpillar species prefers.\n\n4. Ensure that the leaves you feed your caterpillar are fresh.\n\nCaterpillars need fresh leaves to eat. Make sure to replace the leaves each day to keep them fresh.\n\n5. Check your leaves.\n\nBefore feeding your caterpillar, be sure to check the leaves for any signs of mold or decay. Caterpillars can become sick if they eat moldy or rotten leaves.\n\n6. Keep your caterpillar’s home humid.\n\nCaterpillars need a humid environment to molt properly. You can add a damp paper towel to the container to increase the humidity.\n\n7. Clean the container every day.\n\nCaterpillars produce a lot of waste, so it’s important to clean their container every day to keep it clean and healthy.\n\n8. Add soil to the container bottom if your caterpillar will pupate underground.\n\nSome caterpillar species pupate underground. If your caterpillar species does this, add a layer of soil to the bottom of the container.\n\nPart 3: Understanding Butterfly and Moth Lifecycles\n\n1. Know the lifecycle of butterflies and moths.\n\nButterflies and moths go through several stages of development, including egg, larva (aka caterpillar), pupa, and adult. Understanding these stages can help you identify and care for caterpillars.\n\n2. Know how long butterflies and moths live.\n\nButterflies and moths have relatively short lifespans, ranging from a few days to several months, depending on the species.\n\n3. Look for milkweed plants in dry climates and locations.\n\nMilkweed plants are essential host plants for monarch butterflies. They thrive in dry climates and locations.\n\n4. Search for spicebush plants in moist woods and marshes.\n\nSpicebush plants are host plants for the spicebush swallowtail butterfly. They are found in moist woods and marshes.\n\n5. Look for Paw-Paw trees in any moist area throughout eastern North America.\n\nPaw-Paw trees are host plants for the zebra swallowtail butterfly. They grow in moist areas throughout eastern North America.\n\n6. Search for herb plants such as dill, parsley, and fennel.\n\nHerb plants such as dill, parsley, and fennel are host plants for the black swallowtail butterfly.\n\n7. Search for walnut trees in moist bottomland areas throughout North America.\n\nWalnut trees are host plants for the royal walnut moth. They are found in moist bottomland areas throughout North America.\n\n8. Download a plant-identifying app.\n\nIf you’re having trouble identifying host plants, you can download a plant-identifying app on your phone. This can help you quickly identify plants in the field.\n\n9. Get a plant-identifying book.\n\nIn addition to an app, a plant-identifying book can also be helpful when searching for host plants in the field. Look for a book specific to the region in which you live for the best results.\n\nFinding caterpillars can be a fun and rewarding experience. By following these tips, you can learn how to find and care for caterpillars safely and effectively.",
        " Write a peer review by first describing what problem or question this paper addresses, then strengths and weaknesses, for the paper Tensorial Mixture Models, its main content is as below: We introduce a generative model, we call Tensorial Mixture Models (TMMs) based on mixtures of basic component distributions over local structures (e.g. patches in an image) where the dependencies between the local-structures are represented by a \"priors tensor\" holding the prior probabilities of assigning a component distribution to each local-structure.  In their general form, TMMs are intractable as the priors tensor is typically of exponential size. However, when the priors tensor is decomposed it gives rise to an arithmetic circuit which in turn transforms the TMM into a Convolutional Arithmetic Circuit (ConvAC). A ConvAC corresponds to a shallow (single hidden layer) network when the priors tensor is decomposed by a CP (sum of rank-1) approach and corresponds to a deep network when the decomposition follows the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) model.  The ConvAC representation of a TMM possesses several attractive properties. First, the inference is tractable and is implemented by a forward pass through a deep network. Second, the architectural design of the model follows the deep networks community design, i.e.,  the structure of TMMs is determined by just two easily understood factors: size of pooling windows and number of channels. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model when tackling the problem of classification with missing data, leveraging TMMs unique ability of tractable marginalization which leads to optimal classifiers regardless of the missingness distribution.\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns",

        "\n\nHow to Take Blood Pressure Manually\n\nTaking a person's blood pressure manually is a relatively simple process, but it must be done with care to ensure accuracy. This is the most common way to measure blood pressure.\n\nStep 1: Gather Materials\nBlood pressure cuffs can be bought in most drug stores, as well as in some large stores, such as Walmart. They are relatively inexpensive. You will also need a stethoscope. Blood pressure cuffs come in different sizes. It is important to use the proper size for the person whose blood pressure is being taken.\n\nStep 2: Prepare the Patient\nHave the person being tested sit on a chair and rest his or her arm on a table or other flat surface. Don't have the person sit on the edge of a seat or chair, as his or her blood pressure could be inaccurate.\n\nHave the person relax for at least 5 minutes. Any activity, including walking, can affect blood pressure.\n\nMake sure the person is not smoking, as this can also affect blood pressure.\n\nStep 3: Wrap the Blood Pressure Cuff Around the Upper Arm\nWrap the blood pressure cuff around the patient's upper arm, about one inch above the elbow. Make sure the tube coming out of the cuff is on the side closest to the person's body.\n\nDo not put the cuff over clothing. It should be directly against the skin.\n\nIt is important to put the cuff on the arm properly. An improper fit will give an inaccurate blood pressure reading.\n\nThe cuff should be neither too tight nor too loose. To test the fit, press the bulb or dial on the blood pressure cuff. The pressure should be strong, but not painful. There should be just enough space to slide two fingers between the cuff and the arm.\n\nStep 4: Listen for the Sound of Blood Flow\nOnce the blood pressure cuff is in place, open the stethoscope and place the end with the earpiece in your ear.\n\nGently press the other end of the stethoscope against the skin of the arm below the blood pressure cuff.\n\nYou should hear a slow, regular heartbeat. If you hear a faster heartbeat, or one that is irregular, the person may have high blood pressure.\n\nIf you don't hear anything, the person may have low blood pressure.\n\nIf you are taking a person's blood pressure for the first time, or if the person's blood pressure tends to fluctuate, take a blood pressure reading two or three times to ensure accuracy.\n\nStep 5: Take the Blood Pressure Reading\nPress the button or use the dial to inflate the blood pressure cuff. As you do so, listen for changes in the sound of blood flow through the stethoscope.\n\nThe sound of blood flow will become louder as the cuff tightens. When you first hear the sound, note the number on the dial or button of the blood pressure cuff.\nThis is the systolic blood pressure, which is the force the heart exerts on the walls of the arteries each time it beats.\n\nThen, release the dial or button. The sound of blood flow will become fainter as the blood pressure cuff deflates. When you can no longer hear the sound of blood flow, note the number on the dial or button of the blood pressure cuff.\nThis is the diastolic blood pressure, which is the force the heart exerts on the walls of the arteries in between beats.\n\nThe diastolic pressure is always lower than the systolic pressure.\n\nWrite down the blood pressure readings. To get the blood pressure in mm Hg, multiply the systolic pressure by 10 and then add the diastolic pressure. For example, if the systolic pressure is 140 and the diastolic pressure is 90, then 140 x 10 + 90 = 210 mm Hg.\n\nThe blood pressure may be written as \"210/130 mm Hg\" or \"210 over 130 mm Hg.\" The systolic pressure is always listed first, followed by a slash, then the diastolic pressure.\n\nStep 6: Release the Blood Pressure Cuff\nAfter you have finished taking the blood pressure, release the cuff.\n\nStep 7: Repeat as Necessary\nIn some cases, you may need to repeat the process to ensure accuracy. Blood pressure can fluctuate throughout the day, and it can be affected by activity, diet, stress, and other factors.\n\nIf you get an unusual reading, take the blood pressure again, following the same process.\n\nHow to Check Blood Pressure Manually\n\nManually checking blood pressure is a simple process, but it must be done with care to ensure accuracy. This is the most common way to check blood pressure.\n\nStep 1: Gather Materials\nBlood pressure cuffs can be bought in most drug stores, as well as in some large stores, such as Walmart. They are relatively inexpensive. You will also need a stethoscope. Blood pressure cuffs come in different sizes. It is important to use the proper size for the person whose blood pressure is being taken.\n\nStep 2: Prepare the Patient\nHave the person being tested sit on a chair and rest his or her arm on a table or other flat surface. Don't have the person sit on the edge of a seat or chair, as his or her blood pressure could be inaccurate.\n\nHave the person relax for at least 5 minutes. Any activity, including walking, can affect blood pressure.\n\nMake sure the person is not smoking, as this can also affect blood pressure.\n\nStep 3: Wrap the Blood Pressure Cuff Around the Upper Arm\nWrap the blood pressure cuff around the patient's upper arm, about one inch above the elbow. Make sure the tube coming out of the cuff is on the side closest to the person's body.\n\nDo not put the cuff over clothing. It should be directly against the skin.\n\nIt is important to put the cuff on the arm properly. An improper fit will give an inaccurate blood pressure reading.\n\nThe cuff should be neither too tight nor too loose. To test the fit, press the bulb or dial on the blood pressure cuff. The pressure should be strong, but not painful. There should be just enough space to slide two fingers between the cuff and the arm.\n\nStep 4: Listen for the Sound of Blood Flow\nOnce the blood pressure cuff is in place, open the stethoscope and place the end with the earpiece in your ear.\n\nGently press the other end of the stethoscope against the skin of the arm below the blood pressure cuff.\n\nYou should hear a slow, regular heartbeat.

        "Spotify is very popular and has many users who listen to it regularly. This makes up most of its revenue from advertising which helps pay off royalties owed by other companies like Apple Music or Pandora that are paying more than they should be. The money earned through advertisements also allows some musicians to make enough income on top of what they're paid in royalties to cover living expenses while touring with an album release. Some people don't realize how much work goes into making albums until they've made one themselves. It's not just about writing songs anymore; it's about promoting your own brand as well. They get free publicity when someone listens to their song(s) over millions of times every day. It would take years before any artist could build such recognition without having access to this type of platform. Many artists have signed contracts where they agree to allow Spotify to stream their music even though they aren't being compensated fairly because they believe they'll eventually benefit financially down the road",

        "Great question! Unlike most insects, bees and wasps have a strategy to survive the cold weather called diapause. Diapause is a period of physiological inactivity that resembles hibernation in mammals. During diapause, the bees and wasps become inactive and their body temperature drops to match the ambient temperature, which helps conserve their energy. \n\nHoney bees usually spend the winter inside their hives, forming a tight cluster around the queen to keep her warm. As the temperature drops, they become less active, relying on stores of honey that they have collected over the summer. The bees that forage for food become dormant and take a break. The queen also stops laying eggs and reduces her activity. When the temperature rises again in spring, the bees become active and start to prepare for the upcoming season. \n\nOn the other hand, wasps don't have the same loyalty towards their queen, so it's common for them to die off during the winter after the queen has produced enough offspring to survive. The fertilized queens will hibernate during the winter in sheltered locations such as under tree bark, in soil, or in warm spaces like attics. In the spring, the queens will emerge, find an appropriate nesting site, and start the process of building a new colony. \n\nIn summary, bees and wasps don't technically hibernate during the winter, but they do have a process of inactivity called diapause, which helps conserve their energy stores until the temperature rises again. While honey bees can spend the winter inside their hives, wasps will hibernate in sheltered locations before coming out in spring to start fresh.",
        "Title: Cortical-Inspired Open-Bigram Representation for Handwritten Word Recognition\n\nAuthors: [names of authors]\n\nIn this paper, the authors propose a novel approach for handwritten word recognition using a cortical-inspired open-bigram representation. The method is based on the idea that cortical representation has a hierarchical structure that is based on the principles of sparse coding and redundancy reduction. The authors claim that this approach improves recognition accuracy compared to existing methods for handwritten word recognition.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written and presents a comprehensive approach to handwritten word recognition. The experimental methodology used in this study is rigorous, and the results are promising. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the various steps involved in the implementation of the proposed algorithm, which makes it easy for other researchers to replicate their work.\n\nOne of the strengths of this paper is the focus on the cortical representation of handwritten words, which is a unique approach that has not been explored extensively in the past. This approach has the potential to provide a more accurate representation of the underlying structure of the words, which can improve recognition accuracy.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the authors could provide a more in-depth comparison of their method with existing state-of-the-art methods for handwritten word recognition. This would provide a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. Additionally, the authors could provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations of their method and potential future improvements.\n\nIn summary, the proposed approach for handwritten word recognition using a cortical-inspired open-bigram representation is a promising contribution to the field of natural language processing. The paper is well-presented, and the experimental methodology is sound. I recommend this paper for publication, with minor revisions.",
        "\nThis paper proposes a new framework for training vision-based agents for First-Person Shooter (FPS) games, specifically Doom. The framework combines the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approach (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) model) with curriculum learning. The proposed model is simple in design and only uses game states from the AI side, rather than using opponents' information. On a known map, the agent won 10 out of 11 attended games and the champion of Track1 in ViZDoom AI Competition 2016 by a large margin, 35% higher score than the second place. The paper is well-written and provides a good overview of the relevant literature. The experimental results are convincing and suggest that the proposed approach is effective for training vision-based agents for FPS games. However, it would have been helpful to include more details about the experimental setup and results, such as the number of episodes and the number of runs per episode. Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of reinforcement learning and FPS game AI.",
        "The paper titled \"Combining policy gradient and Q-learning\" proposes a new technique called PGQL that combines policy gradient with off-policy Q-learning. The authors motivate the development of the technique by highlighting the limitations of vanilla online variants that are on-policy only and cannot take advantage of off-policy data.\n\nThe authors establish a connection between the fixed points of the regularized policy gradient algorithm and the Q-values, which allows them to estimate the Q-values from the action preferences of the policy. Q-learning updates are then applied to the estimated Q-values. The paper argues that the new technique, PGQL, can improve data efficiency and stability of reinforcement learning algorithms.\n\nThe paper is generally well-written and the authors provide a clear motivation for their work. The technique proposed is well-described, and its implementation in a suite of Atari games demonstrates improved performance over other techniques.\n\nHowever, some points can be improved. The authors could provide more detail on the numerical examples presented, particularly the parameters used in the experiments. A robust parameter search procedure could help readers to better understand the proposed technique's adaptability to different settings. Additionally, the authors provide a brief discussion on the limitations of the proposed technique, but the discussion could be expanded to include more details on the limitations and suggestions for future research.\n\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the reinforcement learning community by proposing a new technique that combines policy gradient and Q-learning with off-policy data. The proposed technique improves data efficiency and stability, with the implementation in a suite of Atari games demonstrating its effectiveness. The paper is recommended for publication with the above-mentioned suggestions.",
        "The empirical evidence suggests the presence of a class of distributions for which the halting time is independent of the underlying distribution under some conditions. I think it’s an interesting and useful result, but I think the authors should discuss the implications of outliers (e.g. Gumbel outliers) and multiple failures (e.g. multiple unsuccessful searches for the Google solution). [Disclaimer: I didn’t read the paper, so I may have missed some implications] [Authors’ reply: Thank you for the comment. We have added the outliers and multiple failure cases into the figure and also discussed their effects in the revised version of the paper.]{} This is a well written and interesting result. The halting time distributions are non-trivial and non-monotonic and may become an important benchmark for random optimization problems, especially spin glasses. I have some concerns about the presentation. First, the terms ‘optimization’ and ‘optimization routine’ may be too generic and not used consistently throughout the text. For example, the first paragraph of Section 2 refers to the algorithm as a generic black box, while in the text itself, the authors also use the word ‘optimization’. Similarly, the term ‘optimization routine’ is used in the first paragraph of Section 4.3, while in the section text itself, this term is replaced with ‘algorithm’. Second, the case for deep learning is presented in great detail, while the case for spin glasses is a more minor part of the paper. I think you can focus more on the spin glasses part. Third, the quantitative analysis of the halting time distributions for spin glasses and deep learning are presented in two separate figures. I think these results could be combined in a single figure. However, I agree with the authors that the result is an important one and merit publication in eLife. [First, we would like to express our appreciation to the reviewer for his/her constructive comments. We have modified the manuscript according to his/her suggestions. We have highlighted the algorithm in the algorithmic part, and omitted it from the spin glass and deep learning parts. In addition, we only focused on the halting time distributions for spin glasses and deep learning, and removed other examples that have similar characteristics (such as the QR factorization and conjugate gradient method). We have also modified the text, figures and data to make them more clear and easier to understand. As a result, our manuscript has been improved greatly.]{.nodewrap} [Second, we would like to express our point of view on this. The optimization problem is often used to represent a real problem. With the rapid development of optimization algorithms and hardware devices, the difference between the optimization problem and the optimization routine becomes smaller and smaller. For example, in the deep learning field, even when using the same model, the initialization method is different (random initialization or pre-trained model) or the number of layers is different (so the objective function is also different), which would make the halting time distributions different. However, the change of the initialization method or number of layers is also a new optimization problem, which has nothing to do with the original optimization problem. In other words, the halting time distributions of different optimization routines may be the same under certain conditions. For example, when using the same random initialization to start, the difference in initialization method will lead to different halting time distributions. Therefore, the halting time distributions only reflect the differences in algorithm or implementation, which are relatively independent of the problem, and have little to do with the algorithmic complexity of the problem. In other words, the halting time distributions are not universal in the strict definition of the word. However, the halting time distributions might be a good metric to compare how different optimization routines affect the performance of a specific problem, for example, in the process of pre-training a model, the performance of the model on the target task may be improved because the optimization routine is not trapped in a local solution. Therefore, although the halting time distributions do not reflect the algorithmic complexity of the problem, they still reflect the optimization algorithm or implementation details of the problem. Therefore, the halting time distributions reflect the difference in optimization routines. In conclusion, although the halting time distributions do not reflect the algorithmic complexity of the problem, it still reflects the optimization algorithm or implementation details of the problem. In the current form, the manuscript still reflects this opinion. I hope you can make the manuscript clearer in this respect.]{.nodeasize} [Thank you for the suggestion. we have modified the text to make it clearer.]{.nodeasize} [We have also modified the figures to make it clearer.]{.nodeasize} [We have also modified the data to make it clearer.]{.nodeasize} [The optimization problem is often used to",

In physics, thermodynamics deals with how matter changes states (e.g. solid state to liquid state) or transforms itself by absorbing heat and/or releasing it.   It also studies how systems exchange thermal energy among themselves.    For example, if you have two different substances A and B at room temperature T0 then they will be able to mix together because their molecular energies match up well enough such that there won't be any chemical reactions taking place between them.     However, when these same substances are heated above some critical temperatures T1 > T2,  ... This means that all physical processes occur spontaneously only under certain conditions where entropy increases continuously until equilibrium is reached.  \nIn order to derive the mathematical expression for the free energy of Gibbs,  let's start off with the definition of enthalpy H which represents the total amount of internal energy U plus kinetic energy K stored within a system.  According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, the net increase in enthalpy ΔH equals the sum of the absorbed heat Q and the mechanical work W performed upon the system during a process.  If no external force acts upon the system, i.e.",

This means holding the book so it's facing away from where you'd normally be reading it; this helps prevent damage caused by fingerprints.   You can also try placing the book between 2 pieces of cardboard as soon as you get home. (This works especially well for hardcover books.)

        "\n\nWe consider a modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND-like) based on the following two simple principles: (i) the gravitational field is given by a potential field (a self-accelerating field-theory), and (ii) the motion of bodies is arrested at a finite distance from massive bodies (such a cosmological constant). We show that such a theory can be made consistent with both the principles of general relativity and the motions of galaxies in the Local Group. We evaluate the Newtonian limit of the theory and show that it displays a suitable relation to the MOND acceleration scale. We analyze a model in which the potential is a function only of the distance between objects, and show that it is capable of describing the dynamics of galaxies in the Local Group, as well as the large-scale structure of the Universe. The parameters of the model are consistent with the idea that the dark matter component has a specific heat of $\\sim 1/2$. We also analyze a model in which the potential is a function of the distance and an extra dimension, and show that it is capable of describing the dynamics of galaxies in the Local Group as well as the large-scale structure of the Universe, provided that the extra dimension is very small. We discuss a possible physical meaning for such theories.",
        "Before Dante Alighieri published his epic poem \"The Divine Comedy\" in the early 14th century, hell had always been viewed as a fiery underworld full of suffering and torment. Since Antiquity, the concept of hell had been a source of moral instruction and moral improvement in society. By the Middle Ages, hell was seen as a place of punishment and divine retribution against unrepentant sinners. Furthermore, it was thought that only those people who had committed major sins would be descended into the fiery depths of the inferno.\n\nDante Alighieri's \"The Divine Comedy\" changed the way we view hell. Through vivid descriptions of its nine concentric circles and the punishments that awaited sinners within it, Alighieri created a unique and powerful vision of hell that was far more imaginative, intricate and detail-driven than anything that had come before it. This view of hell was richer, more nuanced and far more creative than anything seen in the works of earlier writers, such as Virgil and Homer.\n\nIn \"The Divine Comedy,\" Alighieri showed hell to be more than just a place of eternal torment. By illustrating its intricacies and offering insight into the punishments awaiting those who failed to repent, Alighieri painted a more balanced picture of the afterlife. In doing so, he opened up the concept of hell to interpretation and helped create a more nuanced and elaborate understanding of the afterlife.\n\nBy creating a vivid and imaginative world where punishment for sins were both just and merciful and by introducing concepts such as the seven deadly sins and the nine circles of hell, Dante Alighieri forever changed how we view hell. This, in turn, has led to a more dynamic and expansive understanding of the afterlife and of the consequences of immoral actions. As a result, \"The Divine Comedy\" has had a lasting impact on the way that hell is viewed by modern society.",
        "Randomness is an essential element in the financial markets. Although traditionally randomness has been associated with the quantum world, increasingly more evidence is showing that classical randomness, i.e. from random number generators, is a key factor in financial markets. In this paper we review some of this evidence and then present our own work that shows that not only is classical randomness important, but that it plays a central role in how market participants react to new information. We also present some new methods that can detect and quantify classical randomness in financial data. The increasing importance of classical randomness in financial markets. Traditionally, the term 'financial markets' has been associated with the quantum world, and indeed quantum mechanics has had a major impact in the development of mathematical finance. One central tenet of quantum mechanics is that decisions cannot be based on incomplete information. In other words, investors and traders have to have perfect information in order to be able to forecast future events. Classical randomness is an important underpinning of this unpredictability. While quantum mechanics has been incredibly successful in describing the behaviour of atoms and other particles, its application in the financial markets has so far been limited to randomness arising from the quantum world. We will present empirical evidence that shows that classical randomness, i.e. from random number generators, is an essential part of financial markets. In particular, we will present evidence that: 1. The market reacts to classical randomness 2. Market participants take advantage of classical randomness 3. Quantifying classical randomness in financial data It is now well-known that the integrity of the stock market can be seriously compromised by insider trading. Most people assume that insider trading is based on confidential, or 'dark', information. This is not the case. There is a lot of public, or 'white', information out there and much of it is random in nature. As we will show, much of the randomness in financial data can be accounted for using simple, well-known random number generators. Finally, we will present a number of new and original methods for detecting and quantifying classical randomness in financial data. Some of these methods are based on wavelets. We also develop a new technique, based on the Earth Mover's Distance, that can be used to quantify the distance between different random processes. Using these new methods we can show that the market is reacting to classical randomness, that market participants are taking advantage of classical randomness, and that this classical randomness is a key factor in explaining market behaviour. *Note: This paper was originally published in the Financial Review.

This guide will help you determine whether or not you can remove a wall, and will provide step-by-step instructions for doing so.\n\n Determine whether or not the wall is load-bearing. \nA load-bearing wall is one that supports the weight of the floor or roof above it. It typically runs perpendicular to the floor and ceiling. If the wall is load-bearing, you will need to install a beam in its place to support the weight.\n\n If you're not sure whether or not the wall is load-bearing, there are a few things you can look for. First, check to see if there are any support beams or posts in the wall. Second, look at the ceiling above the wall. If there is a crack or split in the ceiling, it could be a sign that the wall is load-bearing.\n\n Plans and measure the wall.\nYou will need to know the dimensions of the wall you are removing. This will help you to determine the amount of work involved, as well as the materials you will need.\n\nMark the wall.\nUse a pencil or chalk to mark out the dimensions of the wall on the floor and ceiling. This will give you a guide to work with as you remove the wall.\n\nDemolish the wall.\nUse a sledgehammer or hammer to break through the wall.

        "\n\nHow to Make a Valentine Candy Box Pop up Card (Robert Sabuda Method)\nCreating a Valentine's Day candy box pop-up card is an enjoyable and unique way to express love and appreciation to that special someone. Whether it's for your friend, family, or significant other, this card is sure to stand out! This candy box pop-up card is designed using the popular Robert Sabuda folding and scoring technique and will leave your Valentine with a delightful memory of your special gift.\n\nMaterials Needed: \n-An 8x11.5 cardstock sheet (preferably pink or red) \n-Scissors \n-Paper clip or pen (without ink) \n-Ruler \n-Glue stick \n-Colored pencils, crayons, or markers \n-Printable templates for the card pieces (included with instructions)\n\nInstructions: \nStep 1: Set Up The Card\nBegin by printing out the templates onto cardstock paper; cut out all the pieces. Click on the images shown in this step to get the images for the card. This will provide you with the necessary candy box pieces, heart, and candy pop-ups. The printed pieces can then be glued onto the main cardstock paper.\n\nStep 2: Score The Card \nOnce all the pieces are in the proper spots, it's time to score the card. Using a ruler as a guide, take the rounded end of a paperclip (or a ballpoint pen that has run out of ink) and press along the dotted line on the center of the card. This will create a score line that helps with the next step. Also score the dotted lines of all the pop-up pieces.\n\nStep 3: Color The Card \nColor in the candies with crayons, markers or colored pencils. For the candy box pieces, you may want to use different colors for certain pieces, such as the lid and the bottom, so they will stand out.\n\nStep 4: Cut The Slot \nUsing a small pair of pointed scissors (kids, get an adult to help you with this part), carefully cut out the slot in the top of the candy box lid. This will be used later for the folding.\n\nStep 5: The Candy Box \nPlace a small amount of glue on the area marked \"Glue A\". Then make a \"mountain\" fold on the dotted lines of the one, long piece that will be the actual candy box as shown. Put a small amount of glue on the area marked \"Glue B\". Fold the far right side of the candy box and press the \"B\" tab firmly and let dry.\n\nStep 6: Finishing Touches \nThe candy box should now look like this. Fold tabs \"C\" and \"D\" up against the sides of the candy box, and make sure the right side that was glued in Step 5 is now at the top. Apply a small amount of glue to the areas marked \"Glue C\" and \"Glue D\".\n\nStep 7: Assemble The Card \nLook to see that your candy box now looks like this. With the tabs still folded in towards the center, fold the card in half along the center. Notice that at the top left side of the candy box there are two small tabs that look like little dog's ears. Thread the slot on the candy box's lid through. Carefully close the card.\n\nVoila! You now have a beautiful and creative Valentine's Day pop-up card that will surely be adored by your special someone. Enjoy the smiles!",
        "\n\nHow to Play Spades\nPlaying Spades is a popular card game that requires four players and two teams. The objective of the game is to win the round and score points by taking as many tricks as possible, with the goal of reaching the score that was predetermined by the players. Knowing the basic rules will help you have yourself and your teammates win. \n\nFirst, decide what the winning score of the game should be. Spades typically requires a score of fifty points to end the game, though this can be adjusted depending on how long the players want the game to last. The number of hands played will determine the length of the game.\n\nAfter you have determined the winning score, it's time to shuffle and deal the cards. There are usually four players. To start, the dealer needs to shuffle the deck and distribute 54 cards to each of the players, one at a time.\n\nOnce the cards are dealt, pick up your cards and keep them hidden from your opponents. This will help you strategize and strategize with your teammate in order to determine the bid for the round. Bidding will be explained in more detail soon.\n\nStarting with the player to the left of the dealer, begin to bid. Bidding in Spades is the way of determining how many tricks the team believes they can take with the hands that were dealt. The minimum number of tricks to be taken is six and the maximum is thirteen. Bidding can also include \"blind nil\" and \"nil\" bids, which are considered advanced gameplay. The highest bid of all the players will be accepted and will be considered the \"contract\" for that particular round.\n\nOnce the bid has been accepted, the player to the left of the dealer will lead first and play a card, followed by the other three players, one at a time. The goal is to follow the suit of the card that is leading, which means that if the leading card is a Heart, then all the other remaining players must also play a Heart. The card with the highest face-value will take the trick unless another player has trumped it (any Spade card).\n\nIf the player cannot follow the lead and does not have the corresponding suit, then they must either discard or \"trump\" by playing a Spade, if it hasn't already been broken. When playing a Spade, the only card that can trump is the Ace of Spades. Also, keep in mind that you cannot lead with a trump in a four-player game. \n\nContinue playing this way until all thirteen tricks have been completed. After each trick is won, the team or player who captured the trick should record their score for that round. \n\nWhen all thirteen tricks have been won, the teams and/or players tally up their points and compare it to the \"contract\" which was their bid at the beginning of the game. If a team/player has taken more tricks than bid, then they should receive one point per trick, also known as an \"overtricks\" or a \"sandbag\" point. After totaling all the points, record them and acknowledge the team/player who has won the round. \n\nFinally, the dealer needs to collect all the cards and shuffle them back into the deck so a new round can begin. By understanding these basic rules of Spades, you and your teammates can begin your journey to winning!",

        "Hey there! I was wondering why all the old people are ladies. I learned that there are some people who are like super duper old, like even older than my grandpa who is already pretty old. And guess what? Most of them are ladies! I don't know why, maybe because ladies are better at living for a long time. Or maybe it's because ladies eat more vegetables and fruit, and we all know that's healthy. \n\nBut wait, I have another idea! Maybe it's because ladies like to talk more than boys. So they keep their brains active and that's why they live longer. Boys should start talking more too, if they want to be old and wise. \n\nI also heard that sometimes ladies take better care of themselves than boys do. They go to the doctor more and take their medicine and vitamins. And they also like to exercise and walk a lot. Maybe boys should start doing that too, if they want to be old and healthy.\n\nAnyway, I don't know for sure why the world's oldest people are mostly ladies. Maybe it's just a big mystery.

Let $(R,m)$ be an Artinian local ring with maximal ideal $m$ and residue field $k$. For each integer $n$ let $R_n$ denote the localization of $R$ at the prime ideals containing $m^n$. The nth level Hilbert function $H_n(R)$ is then defined to be the number of elements in $k^n/m^{n+1}$. \nTheorem 1 (Main theorem).

        "low self-esteem can have on a person.,\nLet go of your ego.,\nSee failure as a learning opportunity.,\nGive yourself a break.,\nTreat yourself.,\nExercise mindfulness.,\nChallenge negative beliefs.,\nThink about your actions.,\nShow appreciation.,\nQuiet the inner critic.,\nRealize you can never please everyone.,\nAsk for help.,\nTune out the negative messages.,\nThink of the bigger picture.,\nReflect on your successes.,\nTake a confidence-boosting step each day.,\nBe kind to yourself.,\nFocus on the present.,\nTake a problem-solving approach.,\nCelebrate your acheivements.\n\nHow to Overcome Low Self Esteem is one of the most challenging hurdles many people face. Self-esteem can drastically affect a person’s life, from their performance at school or work to their relationships and wellbeing. It can be seen as either an uncontrollable gloominess or a more serious condition affecting a person’s life, and may even seem like a personality trait. But self-esteem can be improved and strengthened.\n\nThe first step in improving your self-esteem is to recognize that many people suffer from low self-esteem. It is important to recognize that you are not alone in this, and that it can be something that can be overcome. Knowing this fact can give you the courage to confront your own personal struggle.\n\nThe second step is to identify the thoughts, feelings, physical symptoms, and behaviors associated with low self-esteem. It is likely that you have a running internal dialogue that criticizes your actions, or a feeling of worthlessness and loneliness. You may also feel physical symptoms such as headaches, exhaustion, stomachaches, and dizziness. Another sign that something is wrong is when you have developed behaviors such as avoiding social interactions and situations, procrastinating, being overly perfectionist, or isolating yourself from the world.\n\nThe third step is to start listening to your inner monologue. It is almost certain that the most common words you hear in your head are about the faults you see in yourself. In addition, many of us tend to fixate on the mistakes or missteps that we’ve taken in our lives. This is a deadly combination that can deepen and worsen existing feelings of low self-esteem.\n\nThe next step is to pinpoint exactly how you feel about yourself. It may seem like an overly simple point, but it's important to take a few moments and reflect on how you genuinely feel inside. Do you feel like you are worthless and undeserving of respect? Or do you feel like you could rise up to the challenge? Take the time to think about your self-esteem and how it may have affected your daily life.\n\nLow self-esteem sometimes also manifests itself in physical signs. Make it a point to look for any physical signs related to low self-esteem like slouched posture, trouble making eye contact, avoiding social situations, zero self-confidence, and so on. Once you are able to identify these physical signs, it will be easier to address the root of the issue.\n\nThe fifth step is to assess your behavior and to observe the way that your self-esteem is influencing your life. Have you been excessively evading social interactions, procrastinating, or giving up on your goals? Knowing which exact actions are linked to your self-esteem is a major step towards getting control over them.\n\nThe sixth step is to identify your negative thoughts. The next step is to make an effort to not engage in self-pitying, nagging, puttering-downing, and name-calling. Being a generalist and deciding that you are bad at everything may seem like an escape route from negative thoughts, but this type of thinking will only worsen your self-esteem in the end.\n\nAnother bad habit when it comes to low self-esteem is to compare yourself to others. It is a certain way of lowering your self-esteem without even realizing it. Try to resist the urge to compare because this type of thinking won't do you any good. \n\nIn your head, there is probably a voice that turns everything into the worst and worst-case scenario. It is hard to recognize that your own thoughts are creating this feeling of hopelessness. That’s why it is important to try and push aside this voice, and to recognize it as an enemy for your sense of self-esteem.\n\nIt is also important to remember that you are not a mind reader. You have no way of knowing what other people are thinking let alone seeing their thoughts. It is time to put an end to these destructive thoughts that lead to crippling insecurities.\n\nThe seventh step is to commit to eliminating negative thoughts. Working on yourself involves full commitment. Simply recognizing the negative thoughts will do nothing if you don't take an active role in fighting these thoughts. Learning to differentiate between opinion and fact is also key in this process. What an opinion means is that it can be argued with and that someone else's opinion can differ from yours. A different opinion doesn't have to mean that it is the wrong one.\n\nThe eighth step is to start a self-esteem journal. A self-esteem journal is a great tool for becoming aware of negative thoughts, so you can start tackling them one by one. Take note of any negative thoughts or situations that come up throughout the day and write them down. Becoming a negative thought detective and getting to the root of all these negative thoughts will give you the power to address and either eliminate them or find a way to better deal with them.\n\nOrganize your list and create an overview of these thoughts. Identify feelings associated with each thought, physical symptoms, and behaviors. Try to adjust your thinking and counter the negativity with positive thoughts. This will help you create a positive action plan and remind yourself that you are deserving of respect.\n\nAfter you have done some heavy lifting through in-depth reflection, it is time to move on to the positive. Focus on your positive attributes, your strengths, and skills. Identify areas that you would like to improve and start writing them down. Make sure to be realistic and stay away from setting unreachable goals.\n\nBe sure to surround yourself with people who are positive and passionate and see the best in you. Being assertive instead of passive is also important to build self-confidence. Learning how to stand up for yourself starts by using the word “I” instead of “you” when you talk about yourself and your feelings. This can be difficult, but it can prevent misunderstandings and is a major boost to your self-esteem.\n\nApart from building up positive thinking, taking care of your body and mind is essential. Make sure to have a healthy diet and physical activity in your routine. Stay well-groomed and feeling nice about your outside appearance is also part of this.\n\nThe next step is to make sure that you make time for yourself. It is easy to put yourself and your wellbeing at the end of the priority list, especially if you are a parent. Take the time to remind yourself how worthy and valuable you are and to de-stress.\n\nTo be able to understand and overcome low self-esteem, it is a good idea to seek professional help. Go to therapy to gain additional support and assistance. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy are popular therapies used to help dealing with self-esteem issues and make a lasting impact.\n\nOverall, it is important to think about the potential effects that low self-esteem can have on a person. Take the time to understand the issue better and evaluate your self-esteem issues from multiple angles. Let go of your ego and realize that failure can be a learning opportunity. Give yourself a break, and don’t forget to treat yourself too.\n\nFinally, practice mindfulness and challenge negative beliefs. Stay aware of your thoughts and actions and look at the bigger picture. Keep in mind your successes and accomplishments, and look for the positive in every situation. Take one step each day to boost your self-confidence and be kind to yourself. Finally, if you can’t solve a problem yourself, don’t be afraid or be ashamed to ask for help. With the right approach, mindset, time, and determination, it is possible to overcome low self-esteem and succeed in life.",
        "The virus mutates too quickly and changes its antigens, making vaccines ineffective over time. The virus also infects cells that are hard to reach with antibodies (like liver or brain). Other viruses do not have these characteristics. This makes them easier targets than Ebola. It takes years of research before any new vaccine can be tested on humans because there isn't enough funding available from governments due to low public interest. There aren't many people who will pay money outright just to get vaccinated against an illness they don't know anything about. Also, if you were infected by Ebola you'd probably die within days without treatment anyway which means there's no incentive to develop treatments either since nobody would buy them once developed. It's very expensive to test drugs and vaccines on animals first then move onto human trials. If you're lucky you'll find one that's safe and effective after all this work has been done.

        "The Ashburnham Pentateuch is a medieval illuminated manuscript that contains the first five books of the Old Testament. It was created in the 6th century in either Italy or North Africa and is currently housed in the British Library in London. The manuscript contains 102 intricately illuminated pages, with golden capitals and beautiful calligraphy. The illustrations depict various biblical scenes and characters, including Moses, Aaron, and the Pharaohs of Egypt. The illuminations are done in a Byzantine style, with bright colors and intricate patterns. The Ashburnham Pentateuch has a fascinating history. It is named after its former owner, the Earl of Ashburnham, who purchased it from a French monastery in the 19th century. However, its origins are still somewhat of a mystery. The manuscript is written in Greek, which suggests an Eastern Mediterranean origin. It is possible that it was created in Alexandria, one of the most important centers of Greek learning in the ancient world. The manuscript has also had a tumultuous history, including damage by fire and theft. In 1731, a fire broke out in the library of the King’s Palace in Lisbon, Portugal, where the manuscript was being kept. The manuscript was badly damaged, and several pages were lost. It was later discovered that the fire was set by a thief who tried to steal the manuscript. Despite its age and the damage it has suffered, the Ashburnham Pentateuch remains one of the most important and well-known illuminated manuscripts in the world. It is a testament to the creativity and skill of medieval scribes and illuminators and a valuable resource for scholars of biblical studies, art history, and medieval culture.",

        "The strong chemical bonds in molecules and the high opacity of particules in medium to low temperatures limit the study of Ultracool Dwarfs (UCDs) and Exoplanets. The most massive UCDs have a temperature lower than 20000 K and an effective temperature below 300 K; they are in a gaseous state. The Opacity Project (OP) computes theoretical line and mean opacities for plasmas of different temperatures and compositions, which can be used as input for radiative-transfer simulations and then to fit the observed spectra of these UCDs and Exoplanets. In this work, the authors compute line and mean opacities for plasmas with temperatures lower than 20000 K and effective temperatures lower than 300 K. The inclusion of impurities and traces of metals (like H2O, CO2, NH3, CH4, etc.) extend the computed range of opacities for such kind of plasmas. For example, for plasmas at 10000 K with 90% Hydrogen and 10% Carbon, the authors computed line and mean opacities within 10% of the OP simulation results for pressures between 10-7 and 10-9 torr. Thus, these computed line and mean opacities can be used to simulate the thermal emission and reemission spectra of UCDs and Exoplanets with good accuracy.",

        "The color of blood cells is what determines bruise colors, not necessarily where they were hit.  Red blood cells contain hemoglobin which gives them their red hue.   Yellowish-green blood contains biliverdin (a breakdown product of heme), while bluish-black blood has melanin in it.    The amount of each type of cell present will determine how much of that particular pigment shows up on your skin when you get injured. Some people have more yellowish-brown blood than others so if you're one of those then you'll probably see brown bruising instead of black. If there was no oxygen available to the damaged tissue at all times during healing this would cause an iron oxide stain called hemosiderin to form under the skin causing darker colored bruises like purplish-reds, blues, greens etc.. This happens because without enough oxygen being delivered by the blood vessels nearby these areas heal with less oxygenated blood",
        "This paper is interesting and worth publishing in the proceedings of Linguistic Models conference series. The motivation of this paper is very practical, which is to use word embedding trained on the British National Corpus to predict PoS. This is a natural consequence of the observation that PoS is a strong indicator of meaning and the contexts of words are often related to PoS. The starting point of the paper is a good idea, but it runs into difficulty when experimental results don’t show expected result. There are several potential problems that may lead to the negative results. First, the way that the paper constructs word vectors may not be able to capture enough information. Distributional semantic model is the basic assumption that a word’s meaning is determined by the sum of its context words. The assumption is based on the fact that word vectors are similar to the originals of word that they are belonging to, however it does not explain why two words with the same vector are similar. This motivates a deep learning model that uses multiple layers to generate high-quality word vectors. Another weakness of the assumption is it cannot capture some word relations that are not based on co-occurrence of words in sentences, for example, related words in the same sentence. Last but not the least, the golden rule for building POS tagger is to keep the annotation consistency. In real-world use, different annotators may assign different PoS to the same word. Training a strong tagger with too few samples may be easily affected by such a weak annotated data.",

These transferable adversarial examples may severely hinder deep neural network-based applications. Previous works mostly study the transferability using small scale datasets. In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time. We also present some geometric studies to help understanding the transferable adversarial examples. Finally, we show that the adversarial examples generated using ensemble-based approaches can successfully attack Clarifai.com, which is a black-box image classification system.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI have read the paper and I have some questions about the paper.\n\n\\strong{1.

This passive learning is problematic if we are in- terested in developing interactive machines, such as conversational agents. We propose a framework for language learning that relies on multi-agent communi- cation. We study this learning in the context of referential games. In these games, a sender and a receiver see a pair of images. The sender is told one of them is the target and is allowed to send a message to the receiver, while the receiver must rely on it to identify the target. Thus, the agents develop their own language interactively out of the need to communicate. We show that two networks with simple configurations are able to learn to coordinate in the referential game. We further explore whether the “word meanings” induced in the game reflect intuitive semantic properties of the objects depicted in the image, and we present a simple strategy for grounding the agents’ code into natural language, a necessary step in developing machines that should eventually be able to communicate with humans.\nThis paper is a peer review of the paper Multi-Agent Cooperation and the Emergence of (Natural) Language, written by the author(s) of the paper.

        "The liver is the only vital organ that can repair itself and grow back because of its innate ability to regenerate. In fact, the liver is the only human organ capable of self-repair. The reason for this is still unknown, but scientists have suggested that this regenerative property may be related to the fact that the liver is home to more than 500 unique species of cells, each of which plays a critical role in the function of the organ. As an example, the cells in the liver’s entourage of lymphocytes are involved in combating infection. If the liver is damaged by, say, a sty in the liver tissue, these cells rush in to close the wound. The cells around the organ’s blood vessels also help the liver stay well-supplied with blood. The liver is also home to cells that are responsible for producing the proteins that keep the organ functioning. If, for instance, a protein called albumin gets broken down, the liver’s hepatocytes produce new albumin. Scientists believe that the liver’s ability to regenerate is critical to its ability to survive. When a organ loses too much tissue, its function is compromised. But the liver can regenerate lost cells. For instance, if you eat too much bacon and suffer a fatty liver, you may be able to diet down and regain your original liver weight. The liver is also the only organ in which fetal cells are found in the adult body. This ability to self-repair makes the liver very robust. For example, you could swim or do other exercises up to three times a day, and your liver would continue to produce sufficient amounts of proteins to protect your brain and other vital organs from damage. In many ways, the liver is an amazing and unexpected organ. There are a number of conditions that impair the ability of the liver to regenerate or repair itself, such as a lack of nutrients or drugs, chronic infection, alcohol abuse, and certain autoimmune diseases. Overall, the liver is a very resilient and important organ, sometimes called the “body’s overnight drycleaner.” Although the liver plays an essential role in eliminating potentially toxic substances, our love affair with alcohol has put a lot of stress on it. Too much alcohol can cause liver inflammation and scarring, leading to cirrhosis. The liver is an important organ for maintaining our internal environment, so when it becomes worn out, it signals the body to do something—and the body usually responds by boosting its filtration functions in the kidneys. Please note that this answer has been simplified for the sake of clarity and is not a comprehensive overview of the liver’s functions.",

We have observed 12 nearby galaxies at 21 cm wavelength to determine their total HI mass and distribution within the optical disk. The sample includes both late-type spirals and dwarf irregulars. Our results show that all but one galaxy has an extended HI halo beyond its optical radius; this is true even for the most gas-rich systems such as NGC 4254 and NGC 5253. In addition, we find evidence for significant amounts of atomic gas outside our detection limits which may be associated with tidal features or other interactions between these galaxies and neighboring companions. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that many isolated spiral galaxies contain large quantities of cold interstellar medium distributed over several kiloparsecs. \n \n Keywords: Atomic Hydrogen, Galaxy Evolution, Spiral Structure",
        "There is no definitive answer to this question as there is not much reliable evidence about the treatment of female Soviet Army POWs by the Nazis during World War II. However, accounts from survivors, historical records, and other primary sources can provide some insight into this issue. \n\nIn general, male and female Soviet POWs were treated very similarly by the Nazis, with both groups being subjected to forced labor, malnutrition, torture, and oftentimes execution. While there were cases of Nazi soldiers, such as the infamous Joseph Kramer, who allegedly treated female prisoners cruelly and even committed mass rapes, these instances were highly unusual. Many female Soviet POWs were sent to concentration camps and were held there until they were freed or killed. In the event that they were freed, most of them spent several years in camps before being released. \n\nThere is evidence that, in some rare cases, female Soviet POWs were given somewhat better treatment than their male counterparts. This may have been due to cultural norms of the time, as female prisoners were often seen as more vulnerable. Moreover, there are accounts of female prisoners receiving more food than male prisoners, and also of female prisoners being given more comfortable living quarters in some camps. \n\nThe threat of execution also likely acted as a deterrent for female prisoners; if they attempted to escape or attempted to defy orders from Nazi officers, they were often killed on the spot. Many female Soviet POWs soon discovered that their best chance of survival was to keep their heads down, cooperate with the Germans, and remain obedient.\n\nOverall, the available evidence suggests that male and female Soviet POWs were treated similarly by the Nazis. While there were some rare cases of differential treatment, it is a safe assumption that the majority of female Soviet POWs experienced the same levels of brutality, oppression, and mistreatment as their male counterparts.",

        "Local purity distillation aims to remotely transmit unknown quantum states to a local server without disclosing any classical information to the server. Purity of the states to be transferred is required to be at least as high as the server’s capability to synthesize. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel protocol Local Purity Distillation (LPD) with Bounded Classical Communication (BCC). LPD not only guarantees the remote state transfer with high fidelity, but also limits the server to a finite number of classical queries. In particular, for a 2-qubit state, LPD with BCC only requires the server to perform one query; for a 3-qubit state, the number of queries is two; and for an n-qubit state, the number of queries is O(n). In addition, we further analyze the secure quantum channel condition under LPD and present a tighter bound in the general case. Finally, we also give a real-world application example in digital signature to demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol.",

        " Vishnupant Damle is a Marathi silent film from 1922, directed by Damle and Fatehlal and produced by All India Photo Features. It is considered to be the first Marathi feature film, and the first Marathi film with playback singing. The movie was based on the novel Saraswati-Chandra by Govardhanram Tripathi, and was released theatrically on 18 May 1922. The movie was written and directed by Vitthal Phalke's son-in-law, Damle and his partner Fatehlal. The cast included Vishnupant Damle (co-director of the film), Bhalji Pendharkar, Gajananbua Jadhav, and Kunjalata Khadilkar. The cinematography was handled by Ganpat Nene, and it was edited by Ratnakar Pandit. Vishnupant Damle was shot in a primitive studio system with prints made of nitrate film. Due to the lack of highly developed sound recording technology at the time, it was a silent movie. It featured two-reel fragments of music and songs. The lyrics of these fragments were written by Vishnupant Damle, and sung by Pandurang Kastur, the first playback singer of Marathi cinema. The movie features a love triangle between Panduranga (Vishnu Pant Damle), Narada (Gajananbua Jadhav) and Saraswati (Kunjalata Khadilkar). Saraswati's father obstructs the love affair from taking place, since Narada is from a lower caste. After a struggle, the lovers get finally united. Vishnupant Damle brought about a major revolution in Marathi cinema, being one of the first movies to feature songs and music accompanied by orchestra. It also set the standard for Marathi feature films that were to be produced in the future, both in terms of characterization and narration. The movie was embroiled in controversy due to the censors objecting to the subject matter that spoke of the ill-treatment and discrimination of the lower caste people. It eventually won the hearts of the viewers after much struggle and deliberation, and went on to become a huge success across the country, paving the way for the Marathi film industry to survive and grow in the future. The movie has since been preserved for posterity by the National Film Archive of India.",

At that time, blood transfusions were done in emergency situations, so there was no time to check for compatibility. As a result, many patients who received the wrong kind of blood died. In the early 1900s, Austrian scientist Karl Landsteiner discovered that blood comes in four main types: A, B, AB, and O.

This discovery made blood transfusions much safer because doctors could then make sure that patients received the correct type of blood.",
        "If you take an ant (or a few) and move it 5,000 miles from its colony, the ant will experience disorientation and confusion. Ants rely heavily on their sense of smell, which they use to navigate their environments, find food, and recognize their colony members. When an ant is taken out of its familiar environment and placed in completely unknown surroundings, it will struggle to follow the scents that it is accustomed to, making it difficult for the ant to find food, water, and shelter. Furthermore, the ant will have a hard time distinguishing between nest-mates and strangers, which can make it more likely to be rejected or attacked by foreign ants.\n\nHowever, ants are resilient creatures that are well adapted to adversity. When they find themselves in new and unfamiliar environments, they will explore their surroundings and attempt to establish a new nest. As they explore, they will leave pheromone trails which can help them find their way back to the nest, as well as guide other ants to new food sources. Over time, the ants will gradually establish a new colony and mode of operation that is adapted to the challenges of their new environment.\n\nIn summary, moving an ant (or several) 5,000 miles from its colony may cause it significant disorientation and confusion, but it's highly likely the ant will still find a way to survive and adapt to its new surroundings.",

Primarily, a forest is distinguished by a relatively uncrowded canopy with an abundance of well-developed understory plants, while a jungle is characterized by a dense canopy and a lack of understory growth. Forests are dominated by trees, with a sufficiently high population of individuals to provide mutual support and facilitate the interchange of resources. On the other hand, jungles are formed by densely intermingled trees, vines, lianas, herbs, shrubs and epiphytes, and the result is often a complex and congested ‘vertical layering’ within the plant community.\n\nIn addition to differences in the abundance and variety of plants, the climates in which forests and jungles are distributed also vary greatly. Forests tend to be located in moist, temperate climates and are often found at higher elevations, characterized by greater rainfall and cooler temperatures. Jungles, on the other hand, are found in dry, tropical climates and often lower elevations or near oceanic coasts, and are characterized by greater sunlight exposure and intense temperatures, resulting in the need for plants to develop adaptations to a drier environment.\n\nThe primary defining factor between a forest and a jungle is the presence of a dense canopy and lack of sufficient understory growth that allow a forest’s plant community to thrive under a greater sunlight and rainfall gradient. Additionally, a key difference is the variance in climate zones which these ecosystems are located in, whether it is characterized by hotter areas with more sunlight or cooler areas with greater rainfall. Forests and jungles are mostly distinct morphological, physiological and ecological communities, yet their transitions are important for maintaining an appropriate balance of nature",
        "As a 10-year-old, I'm not sure I know what is happening between you and your friend. But I do know it isn't something that is allowed in our village or any other villages. In some cases, it can be punishable by death.\n\nIn the 13th century England, punishing people for sins was taken seriously. And it may seem like something small, but it could mean being accused of heresy and even being put to death.\n\nI think that if you or your friend have been caught by another villager, they would report you to the local authority. The local authority would then decide how to handle the situation. Depending on how strict they are, they could decide to execute you or your friend for the \"relations\" you were having.\n\nThis wouldn't just be done for sodomy but also for other forms of sexual activities. It would depend on the local authority and the laws that were in place at that time. They may also decide to punish you for other reasons like perjury, blasphemy or other crimes.\n\nSo my best advice is to be very careful with whatever you do and keep your relations away from anyone who might find out and report you. Hopefully, they will be lenient in your case and give you a lighter sentence.",
        "\n\nHow to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda 626 1993 to 20021\n\nYour timing belt is one of the most important parts of your engine. If it fails, your engine will stop running. It's therefore important to replace your timing belt before it fails. This will not only save you the hassle of being stuck on the road, but it can also save you money in repairs. Fortunately, you can change your timing belt yourself with a little bit of knowledge and the right tools.\n\nDetermine if you have a timing chain or a timing belt. The timing chain is a metal, toothed chain that runs in the engine and turns the camshaft at the right time. The timing belt is a rubber, toothed belt that runs in the engine and turns the camshaft at the right time.\n\nA timing chain does not usually need to be replaced, but a timing belt will eventually wear out and break. If your timing chain breaks, it will cause the engine to stop running and will need to be replaced.\n\nDetermine if you have a 4 cylinder or 6 cylinder engine. The 4 cylinder engine has one timing belt, while the 6 cylinder engine has two timing belts.\n\n4 cylinder engine\n\n1. Find the timing mark on the engine. The timing mark is usually a small arrow or line on the engine that shows the location of the timing belt. It's usually located near the timing belt, but not always.\n\n2. Remove the timing belt. The timing belt is usually held in place with tensioners and bolts. First, remove the tensioner bolts and the tensioner. Then, you can remove the timing belt.\n\n3. Install the new timing belt. First, thread the new timing belt around the camshaft and crankshaft. Make sure the timing marks on the belt line up with the timing marks on the engine. Then, replace the tensioner and tensioner bolts.\n\n4. Start the engine and check the timing. Start the engine and check to make sure the timing marks on the engine and timing belt line up. If they don't, the timing is off and you'll need to re-adjust it.\n\n6 cylinder engine\n\n1. Find the timing marks on the engine. There are two sets of timing marks, one for each timing belt.

        "This paper presents an efficient method to calculate polynomial feature mappings on sparse matrices. Most feature mapping algorithms are only suitable for dense input matrices, i.e., matrices in which every row is fully overlapping with every other row. However, in many applications, the use of a feature mapping on a sparse matrix (i.e., a matrix in which only a few rows are non-zero) results in more efficient algorithms and better performance. For example, this is the case for many computer vision applications, in which images are typically represented as sparse matrices in which every pixel is non-zero. In such applications, a simple feature mapping that is commonly used is the Hadamard product, in which each entry of the sparse matrix is taken pairwise, corresponding row and column indices are added, and then the resulting matrix is raised to a polynomial power. This paper presents an algorithm that is similar to the Hadamard product but less compute-intensive, thus allowing for the efficient calculation of a more general class of mappings on sparse matrices. The authors start by giving an overview of the different types of mappings that can be computed on sparse matrices. Then, they introduce the essentials of polynomial (or rational) functions, which are defined over the field of complex numbers. They then present the Krylov subspace method, which can be used to efficiently solve a system of linear equations derived by applying a mapping to a given vector. The Krylov subspace method is then applied to calculate the Cholesky factor of a positive-definite matrix and the kernel of a matrix-times-matrix product. Finally, the authors show how to use precomputed kernels to efficiently calculate more general mappings on sparse matrices. The authors present a good overview of existing and possible future mapping algorithms and the efficient methods to solve resulting systems of linear equations. The method to calculate the Cholesky factor and the kernel is also of general interest and could be reused in other contexts. However, a critical point of this paper is that the mappings are calculated on sparse matrices, but the method to generate the Cholesky factor and the kernel from dense matrices is not clear. Without this generating function, the paper is essentially only about efficient calculation of mappings from sparse to dense matrices.

First, the kernel of a matrix-times-matrix product is calculated. The authors then show how to calculate the kernel of the product of a general matrix with its adjoint. The adjoint of a matrix is the transpose of its conjugate transpose. The first mapping is already of interest because it is the basic component in many video coding standards, such as HEVC. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time this mapping is calculated efficiently. The second mapping is also of interest because it is a component in several video coding standards, such as HEVC. However, for the generation of the kernel from a general matrix, the authors use a method from linear algebra which, to my knowledge, has not been applied to calculate kernels of matrix-times-matrix products.

        "\n\nThis paper presents a novel approach to regularizing dropout neural networks, which is based on characterizing the gap between the training and inference phases of dropout. The authors first formulate dropout as a tractable approximation of some latent variable model, which leads to a clear understanding of parameter sharing and enables further theoretical analysis. They then introduce expectation-linear dropout neural networks, and characterize the inference gap. Algorithmically, they show that their proposed measure of the inference gap can be used to regularize the standard dropout training objective, resulting in an explicit control of the gap. The paper also provides upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to expectation-linearization, and describes classes of input distributions that expectation-linearize easily. Experiments on three image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that reducing the inference gap can indeed improve the performance consistently.\n\nOverall, this paper provides an interesting and novel approach to regularizing dropout neural networks. The authors have provided a clear and thorough explanation of the theory behind their approach, as well as evidence of its effectiveness in practice. The paper is well-written and the results are well-presented. The authors should be commended for their contribution to the field.",

        "\nWe study the effects of the anomaly on the two-flavor QCD chiral phase transition. We consider a general definition of the chiral transition temperature, and evaluate the conditions for the anomaly to have a significant effect on the transition. We show that the anomaly can delay the transition, and can even lead to a transition to a phase where the fermionic generators are not balanced. The conditions for this to occur are rather general, and in particular do not require a particular form for the potential between the two fermionic generators. We also derive a general criterion for the transition temperature to be sensitive to the anomaly. We then study the particular case of a point-coupling potential, and evaluate the conditions for a transition temperature to exist in this case. We show that these conditions are rather general, and in particular do not require the anomaly to be large. We finally study the effect of a small anomaly on the thermodynamic properties of the chiral transitions, and in particular on the order parameter and on the critical temperature. We show that small anomalies can have a significant effect on these quantities, even when they do not delay the transition.",

The study includes both analytical and numerical solutions of the time-dependent wave equation for a range of starting conditions corresponding to various initial photon numbers and wavepacket configurations. The system exhibits a range of behaviors depending on the distance between the partially reflective and the stationary mirror, the energy of the incident photon, and the initial wavepacket configuration. These behaviors include reflection, transmission, and splitting into transmitted and reflected waves for various combinations of the above parameters. In general, the transmitted wavepacket exits the system to the right of the stationary mirror and the reflected wavepacket enters the system to the left of the stationary mirror.

        "\n\nHow to Scrimshaw\nScrimshaw is an age-old craft which involves engraving and decorating solid pieces of bone, ivory and other materials. It is an art which has been practiced for centuries and although it can look intimidating, anyone can learn the basics of it with a few simple steps and some practice. \n\nTo get started, there are a few materials which you will need. To begin with, you should shop around old salvage yards or thrift stores for small pieces of ivory. It is important to be mindful of laws concerning ivory. Next, you will need to purchase a pen-like X-acto knife with a replaceable head. You will also need to get some good quality beeswax, black, brown or blue ink and some acetone nail polish remover.\n\nOnce you have all the materials you need, you should start by applying the beeswax to the surface of the bone or ivory to seal it. Depending on what you are using, you can either use a tool to spread it or do it by hand. If you decide to do it by hand, you should use a cloth and work the beeswax into the surface for around five minutes. Once the wax is spread evenly over the surface, buff it with a clean cloth until all the beeswax is gone.\n\nYou should then measure your piece of ivory and find an image online or in a book that you would like to recreate. Make sure to shrink it to the size of the object you will be using. Print the image onto a sheet of paper and place the ivory on top of it. Trace an outline over the paper. Lift up one edge of the paper and quickly peel it away.\n\nAt this point, you will need to trace the outlines of the illustration with your X-acto knife. If it is too hard to make out the lines, you can dip the tip in a bit of ink, so that it leaves an impression. Make sure to change the head of your knife regularly when it begins to dull a little.\n\nOnce you have completed outlining the image, you can then begin to shade it by etching crosshatched lines into the ivory. You can also use cotton swabs to apply more ink and then wipe it off. When you are happy with your work, grab your beeswax-covered cloth and wipe off all the ink from the surface. \n\nScrimshaw is a great way to make somethings unique and personal. It is definitely a craft that requires patience and practice, but with time, anyone can master the basics.",
        "Great question! The main reason why produced beats and songs often run at 119, 129, 139 BPM (beats per minute) rather than multiples of 10, such as 120, 130, or 140, is because they’re following the beat grid of popular songs. This means that the beats and samples being used in the production of the track are designed to match the timing of the song in particular sections and to a certain tempo. \n\nIn other words, producers want their beats to fit within the standard structure of popular music, and by using a beat pattern close to the original, they can avoid any empty spaces or missed beats. In addition, when using samples, producers often use a bit of swing or timing variation to add to the flow of the track – something that wouldn’t be possible if they were using strict tempos like 120, 130, or 140 BPM.\n\nAnother important reason why producers use alternating tempos is because they often look to create a unique sound that’s both unique and fresh. By using BPMs other than multiples of 10 BPM, producers are able to create tracks that have a different tempo or feel, while still being able to easily overlay samples and match the new track’s BPM to the original track’s tempos. \n\nFurthermore, some genres of music require the use of varying tempo ranges to make the music sound properly. For example, hip hop often has tempos that range from 67 to 97 BPM, whereas EDM generally ranges from 130 to 160 BPM. By experimenting with different BPMs, producers can create more interesting and complex music that better represents their genre.\n\nUltimately, using BPMs other than multiples of 10 gives producers more freedom to experiment with their music and create tracks that are both unique and reflect their genre. So while the answer may be a bit complicated, the main reason why beats and songs often run at 119, 129, 139 (etc) BPM is to give producers more creative control over the music they make.",

        "Beta-dystroglycan is a Schwann cell membrane receptor for laminin found in the basal lamina that surrounds neurons. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), dystroglycan functions to connect the extracellular matrix with the actin cytoskeleton, thus enabling Schwann cells to adhere to, and organize their cellular processes on, the axonal surface. In central nervous system (CNS), similar function of dystroglycan has been suggested, but the evidence is less robust. Mutations in the dystroglycan gene (DAG1) cause a congenital muscular dystrophy known as dystroglycanopathy. Using the mouse Model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (MDX), we found that utrophin, a functionally homologous protein of dystrogin, is upregulated at the membrane of Schwann cells. A search for the responsible mRNA transcript identified dystrobrevin-2 as a likely binding partner of utrophin. By co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate that dystrobrevin-2 is part of the same complex as utrophin in Schwann cells. Furthermore, using RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analysis, we report changes in beta-dystroglycan processing in the MDX Schwann cells: in the axonal surface of Schwann cells, the beta-dystroglycan transcript is reduced by half, and this reduction is statistically significant. In the cytoplasmic pool of Schwann cells, we found the full-length beta-dystroglycan transcript was dramatically reduced with no significant change in transcript splicing. Furthermore, this reduction is statistically significant. These significant changes in the level of the full-length and cleavage transcripts of the beta-dystroglycan gene correspond with a redistribution of the protein from the axonal surface to the cell membrane. In the axonal surface, there is no reduction in beta-dystroglycan protein. These results suggest a novel role for beta-dystroglycan in Schwann cells: that of anchoring the membrane to the extracellular matrix via utrophin in the axonal surface membrane and dystrobrevin-2 in the cell membrane. In addition, the reduction in full-length and cleavage transcripts of beta-dystroglycan in the Schwann cell cytoplasmic pool suggests another role for beta-dystroglycan in Schwann cells: that of sending a signal to the nucleus. The role of utrophin in Schwann cells has not been previously examined. We hypothesized that utrophin, a functionally homologous protein of dystrogin, might compensate for the lack of dystroglycan by forming a complex with dystrobrevin-2 in the Schwann cell membrane, thus anchoring the membrane to the extracellular matrix via dystroglycan. Our findings reveal a novel function for beta-dystroglycan in Schwann cells: the anchoring of the membrane to the extracellular matrix via utrophin",

        "\nThe paper presents a simple yet effective technique to improve the performance of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by incorporating feedback from previous gradient updates. The main idea is to use a moving average of the gradients to update the weights, which allows for a more efficient exploration of the loss landscape. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on a variety of benchmark datasets, showing that it can improve the convergence speed and final test error of SGD.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written and presents a clear and concise description of the proposed method. The results are convincing and show that the method is a useful addition to the SGD algorithm. However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved.\n\nFirst, it is not clear how the proposed method differs from the well-known Adam optimization algorithm. Both methods use a moving average of the gradients to update the weights, so it would be helpful to see a more thorough comparison between the two methods.\n\nSecond, it is not clear why the proposed method is more effective than simply using a larger batch size for SGD. The paper states that the method is particularly effective for small batch sizes, but it is not clear why this is the case. It would be helpful to see a more thorough analysis of the effect of the batch size on the performance of the proposed method.\n\nFinally, it is not clear how the proposed method would perform on more complex datasets or in more challenging optimization problems. It would be helpful to see some more realistic evaluation of the method in terms of its performance and convergence speed.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a useful technique to improve the performance of SGD, and it would be a valuable addition to the literature on optimization algorithms.",

        "Well, I'm not sure if time travel is possible or not, but some smart people have been thinking about it for a long time. There are some who say that time travel could be possible if we could make a big machine that could bend time and space. Others think that even if time travel is possible, we might not be able to do it because it would be too dangerous. \n\nBut how can we know for sure? I think we need to keep studying science and learning more about the universe to find out. Maybe someday we will discover something new that will help us figure it out. It's important for us to ask questions and try to find answers, even if we're not sure if we can find them. That's how we learn and make progress. \n\nUntil then, I think it's fun to imagine what it would be like to travel back in time or see the future. We can read books and watch movies about time travel and use our imaginations to think about what it would be like. Maybe someday we will even be able to make time travel a reality, but for now, it's still a big mystery.",
        "Yes, it is possible for a planet to have a solid surface and a molten core, which helps regulate the planet's temperature, all without the presence of a sun. This type of planet, referred to as a super-Earth, is thought to be about five times larger than the Earth and would have a stronger force of gravity.\n\nSimilar to how our Earth's molten core provides us with heat, heat inside of a super-Earth could be generated from natural sources within the planet as well, such as friction from high-pressure and high-temperature belts, and potentially from the decay of radioactive elements. This heat source would be sustained without the influence of a nearby star.\n\nThe mass of a super-Earth could give rise to powerful geological forces that would have a significant impact on the surface mantle and core of the planet. In this way, the planet could continue to be tectonically active, although much slower than on Earth. Thus arguments have been made that tidal heat and temperature could be regulated to a degree that would give way to the development of life without sunshine.\n\nFurthermore, other elements in the environment also must be conducive to sustenance of life. Scientists are currently investigating various routes by which a super-Earth could sustain itself and even thrive given the absence of a star near its position. The issue of having enough available energy is still highly uncertain, but some research teams speculate that the residual heat from any nearby stars, as well as the infinite pressure caused by the depths of space could give way for some plausible energy sources.\n\nOverall, if such a planet existed in the right spot, and had a thin enough atmosphere to regulate its temperature, it could possibly support life, even without explicit material from the sun. While much more research is needed to still determine the exact conditions for this to be possible, the prospects for a super-Earth harboring life without reliance on a nearby star is highly perplexing and presents a tantalizing prospect.",
        "Our study focuses on the investigation of the microscopic properties of vortex state in the Yttrium Hexaboride (YB6) compound by utilizing the muon spin rotation technique. Our research attempts to solve the problem of understanding the properties of magnetic vortices within the framework of a weakly coupled superconductor.\n\nOur motivation for such research arises from the lack of knowledge regarding magnetic vortex matter, which has attracted significant attention due to its potential applications in superconducting devices. However, studies on this subject matter have been limited due to the difficulty of probing the microscopic properties of  vortex matter.\n\nTo address this, we performed muon spin rotation experiments to measure the internal magnetic field in vortex state, and how it varies with temperature. Our results indicate the existence of superconductivity with vortices, as well as a possible reentrant phase transition at low temperatures. We also found that the magnetic penetration depth is temperature-dependent, revealing the presence of strong electron-phonon coupling.\n\nIn conclusion, our study offers an in-depth understanding of the magnetic properties of vortex state within weakly coupled superconductors. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the potential of using muon spin rotation as a technique to probe the microscopic properties of vortex matter.",

        "\nWe consider a scenario where an axion condensate is present in the early Universe and the axion fluid is able to sustain a significant vortex structure that collapses in the later Universe to form a dark matter halo. We show that the energy density of this vortex has the right scale to become a dark matter halo with the same energy density as the one observed in the Universe. We find that the growth of the vortex is governed by the mass flux through the vortex core, which in our case is driven by the anisotropic pressure. Therefore, our scenario can provide a physical explanation for the velocity distribution function of dark matter particles, which is consistent with the data from large scale structure formation. The core of the vortex is able to sustain a significant amount of mass, because the mass flow is driven by the pressure gradient and the structure is able to keep itself stable by the positive feedback from the gravitational attraction. We show that the outer regions of the halo contain much less mass, and the profile is able to fit the observations.",

        "Yes, insects do have muscles. However, their muscles differ from human muscles in structure and function. In insects, muscles are attached to the inside of the exoskeleton, whereas in humans, muscles are attached to bones via tendons.\n\nInsect muscles are also arranged differently than human muscles. Insects have two types of muscles - striated and smooth. Striated muscles, like those found in human arms and legs, are used for voluntary movement. Smooth muscles, on the other hand, are used for involuntary movements like the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system.\n\nWhen it comes to carrying weight, ants have an impressive ability due to their small size and strength. Ants have specialized muscles in their necks that allow them to carry loads that are up to 50 times their body weight. These muscles are structured in a way that allows ants to exert force in multiple directions, allowing them to manipulate objects with precision and ease.\n\nIn conclusion, insects do indeed have muscles, but they are structurally different from human muscles. Insects have striated and smooth muscles, and they also have specialized muscles that allow them to carry heavy loads. These specialized muscles, along with other adaptations, allow ants to carry more weight than humans proportionally.",

        "\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to determine if a gravimetrical method could be designed to revive the corpuscular theory of light. The idea for this method was inspired by the double-slit experiment. The basic setup for this method consisted of a light source, a double-slit aperture, and a photoelectric detector. The intensity of the light that hit the photoelectric detector was measured and recorded. The photoelectric detector was adjusted so that the brightest spot in the double-slit pattern was at the center. Then, the gravitational field was applied to the light by placing a mass directly above the light source. The mass was allowed to fall freely and it passed between the two slits. The falling mass changed the path of the light, which in turn changed the position of the bright spot on the photoelectric detector. After the mass passed the double-slit aperture, the bright spot was back in the center of the photoelectric detector. The photoelectric detector measured the intensity of the light, which should have decreased while the mass was passing in front of the double-slit aperture. The data showed that the intensity of the light decreased while the mass was passing in front of the double-slit aperture. This result suggests that the corpuscular theory of light may be revived using a gravimetrical method.",
        "In this study, we present the results of our comprehensive survey in the centre of the sigma Orionis star formation region using near-infrared (NIR), optical, and X-ray imaging. Our primary objective was to explore the physical and environmental properties of young stars and their circumstellar disks in this region. We used data from both archival and newly obtained observations to identify 602 candidate young stellar objects (YSOs). By analyzing their NIR colors and spectral energy distributions (SEDs), we classified the YSOs into Class I, II, and III, with 88% of them being Class II. We also find evidence for the presence of transitional disks, which are disks with inner depleted cavities, around 26% of the YSOs. \nFurthermore, we correlated the NIR and optical data with the X-ray properties of the YSOs to investigate their relationship with the disk evolution and disk locking mechanism. We found that the X-ray emission correlates with the disk fraction and surface density. Our results suggest that disk evolution in sigma Orionis is likely regulated by the interplay between magnetic fields, accretion, and X-ray ionization. Overall, our survey provides valuable insights into the physical processes governing star and disk formation in this region, which could help us to better understand the early stages of star formation and the diversity of planetary systems.",
        "Victor Hugo is referring to the fact that during the reign of Louis XV, approximately 800 children were kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Kingdom of Chine. It is believed that these rumours began during the reign of Louis XVI, when several of these children were able to escape and returned to France to reveal the conditions to which they had been sold. Whether or not this information would have been common knowledge to a reader in the early 1800s is questionable; it is certainly not common knowledge today. In fact, the majority of French people have never heard of the 'purple baths', and most are unaware that children were ever sold into slavery in the Kingdom of Chine.

        "\n\nIntroduction\n\nLight scattering methods are commonly used to analyze blood cells. A widely used light scattering parameter is the volume-equivalent diameter, which is obtained by measurement of the scattered light at low angles (Forward Scatter) with respect to the incident beam. This parameter is, however, not well suited for the analysis of fragile blood cells, such as elderly red blood cells (RBCs), which may be sensitive to mechanical stress. In this study, we present a new parameter, which we call the opacity, obtained by measurement of the scattered light at high angles (Side Scatter). The new parameter is more sensitive to the internal structure of the RBC, than the conventional Forward Scatter parameter.\n\nMethods and Results\n\nWe have performed experiments with a commercial flow cytometer, equipped with a high-speed digital signal processor, for simultaneous measurement of Forward and Side Scatter. RBCs from 3 healthy donors and 3 patients with microangiopathy were studied. The analysis was made on single RBCs, and the average values and standard deviations of the Forward and Side Scatter parameters were determined. In addition, the ratio of the Side Scatter to the Forward Scatter was calculated. A low ratio indicates an increased internal reflectivity, and is therefore indicative of a fragile RBC. The results show that the new Side Scatter parameter is capable of differentiating between healthy and fragile RBCs.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented a new parameter, the Side Scatter, for characterization of RBCs. The new parameter is more sensitive to the internal structure of the RBC than the conventional Forward Scatter parameter, and can therefore be used for analysis of fragile RBCs.",

        " Peder Valentin Rosenkilde was a Danish landscape painter and art professor. He was born in the small town of Vejerslev, Sjælland, Denmark in 1852. As a youngster he would often spend time drawing his surroundings. He eventually gained the support of his mother who noticed his talent, and entered the drawing school of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1866. In 1870 he was accepted to the Academy's painting school, where he was taught by Marius Ilsted and Viggo Johansen. Rosenkilde had a much success during his lifetime, achieving several awards and exhibiting in Paris, Rome, and Vienna. He also won a silver medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1889. Some of his works were bought by the National Gallery of Denmark and included in the collection of the Statue of Liberty. Rosenkilde was a dominant figure in the art scene of Denmark for half a century. In 1898 he was appointed professor at the academy in Copenhagen, where he would become the head of the painting department. In addition to his teaching and painting duties, he served as chairman at the academy on many occasions. He also was a member of a great number of arts associations and organizations. Aside from his teaching, Rosenkilde was widely known and respected in the art community. He was an active supporter of the free sculpture movement, which often came into conflict with the works of more conservative artists. He also wrote poetry, published several theoretical writings on the subject of art, and recognized later Peder Række’s works on the technique of portraying light and landscape. Rosenkilde passed away in 1934, leaving behind a strong impression on the Danish art scene. He was celebrated for his progressive ideas, influence in teaching, and commitment to the development of contemporary art. Additionally, his work as a painter of landscapes full of life, light, and color is considered one of his most important legacies.",

        "Write a long abstract of a scientific paper from arXiv.org. Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Faithful Effective-One-Body waveforms of small-mass-ratio coalescing black-hole binaries\".\nAbstract:\nWe present the first results for effective-one-body (EOB) waveforms that are faithful to numerical relativity simulations over an entire inspiral, merger and ringdown phase of binary black hole systems with mass ratios q = m1/m2 as low as 1/10.  We use EOB theory in conjunction with fits to numerical-relativity data to construct accurate templates for gravitational waves emitted by such systems. The resulting template bank is used to search for signals from these sources using LIGO's second observing run data. Our analysis shows that this new class of EOB waveforms can be used to detect binary black holes out to redshifts z ~ 5 at design sensitivity of Advanced LIGO/VIRGO detectors. This represents a significant improvement compared to previous searches based on post-Newtonian approximations or phenomenological models. \nThe detection rate of binary black holes predicted by our analysis agrees well with current estimates obtained within the standard ΛCDM cosmology model.",
        "This is a very complex question and depends on many factors. One important factor is how the languages are structured and how the pronunciation works. For example, if the languages you want to learn have a lot of complicated grammar or have difficult pronunciations, it will be hard to master them. There are many language families. For example, Romance languages, Germanic languages and Slavic languages are all language families. People can usually learn one or two languages from these language families. However, if someone want to start from scratch and learn Japanese, Chinese, Korean or Arabic, it will require many years of studying with difficult materials. Even for people who are fluent in one of these languages, it will be very difficult to speak another language from this language family because the structures and pronunciations are very similar. Another important factor is the cost. If you want to learn multiple languages, the cost can become very expensive. Usually you need to take several courses at the same time to learn different languages. Some courses are in textbooks which are very expensive. If you need to purchase different dictionaries, grammars and other learning materials for different languages, it can become very expensive. The time you can spend on each language is also a limiting factor. If you need to study full-time for an occupation which pay you salary, it is hard to learn multiple languages because you only have a limited amount of time. Also, people who learn multiple languages have higher salary than people who only know one language. People usually do not choose to learn multiple languages because they can only have one favorite language which they use to communicate with other people. There are many people around the world who learn multiple languages. Usually it is because they live in different countries and need to communicate with people from different countries. For example, if you travel a lot, you will find there are many restaurants or store with different languages. You can choose the language you want to learn to interact with these places. In general, you can learn up to two languages from different language families and no more than that because of the similar structures and pronunciations.",
        "Net neutrality is one of the most important issues that has arisen in the digital age. Despite the fact that President Biden promised to support net neutrality during his election campaign, there are still significant obstacles that must be overcome if the issue is to be effectively solved.\n\nThe issue of net neutrality surrounds the regulation of bandwidth use on the Internet. It is a highly contested and politicized issue, as it involves the roles of both the public and private sector in the legislative and regulatory process. Essentially, it concerns the idea that Internet providers should treat all the data, websites, applications and services on the Internet equally—without providing any discrimination, either in the form of better access to those sites, applications and services that are owned or operated by the provider itself, or those owned and operated by other third parties.\n\nThe concept of net neutrality is supported by many different stakeholders. Internet users as well as content and service providers, application developers, and even Internet service providers are all in favor of net neutrality, as it ensures a level playing field for innovation, competition and creativity in the digital space.\n\nThe main obstacle towards implementing net neutrality is that there is a great deal of opposition from within the private sector. Internet service providers, particularly those that are the most large and powerful, have actively lobbied the public and political sector to block any efforts to enact legislation and regulation that ensure net neutrality. This is largely because they stand to lose a great deal if they are forced to offer the same level competitive access to all of their Internet services.\n\nFor this reason, it is of paramount importance that individuals and organizations continue to fight for net neutrality, even if they have voted into office a president that supports it. Simply electing a president who supports net neutrality does not resolve the issue—it merely opens the door for further regulation of the Internet. Only by continuing to engage in debates and address the stakes at play will net neutrality be able to be properly implemented.",
        "Living with Celiac Disease can be challenging, but it's certainly not impossible. Celiac Disease is an autoimmune disorder caused by the intolerance of gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The only known treatment for Celiac Disease is to follow a gluten-free diet, which implies cutting out all sources of gluten from your meals.\n\nLuckily, these days there are many gluten-free options available, and living with Celiac Disease is easier than ever before. In this article, we will guide you through the steps on how to live with Celiac Disease.\n\nStep 1: Try not to eat foods that contain gluten, if any at all.\n\nAvoiding gluten can be challenging, but it is the most crucial step when managing Celiac Disease. Gluten can have debilitating effects on your gut, immune system, and overall health. You'll need to start by cutting out all common sources of gluten from your diet, such as bread, pasta, and cereals.\n\nStep 2: Do some research to find out what foods typically have gluten in them.\n\nAfter that, you'll need to do some research to identify all the other foods that may contain hidden sources of gluten, such as Soy sauce, beer, and some oats.\n\nStep 3: Read ingredient labels, as this is the only way to truly know if gluten is in the products you're buying.\n\nTo be completely sure, make it a habit to read ingredient labels on everything you buy. Look out for common ingredients such as wheat, barley, and rye.\n\nStep 4: Look for gluten-free items on restaurant menus.\n\nEating out can be difficult when you have Celiac Disease. Still, many restaurants offer gluten-free options, so it's best to look out for menus that explicitly mention gluten-free items.\n\nStep 5: Seek the advice of a nutritionist/dietitian specializing in gluten-free diets.\n\nIt's important to consult with a nutritionist or dietitian who has experience with gluten-free diets. They can help you create the right menu plan that will provide your body with the required nutrients, while still being interesting and easy to follow.\n\nStep 6: Follow your gluten-free diet strictly.\n\nIt's vital to follow your gluten-free diet strictly to maintain your overall health and wellbeing. If you accidentally consume gluten, you may experience symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.\n\nStep 7: Talk to your doctor about any drugs that can help aid in absorption.\n\nSupplements may help increase the absorption of nutrients that your body needs. Always talk to your doctor about any supplements, and be sure you stick with gluten-free alternatives.\n\nStep 8: Participate in a celiac disease support group.\n\nFinding ways to manage Celiac Disease can be difficult, but connecting with a support group can be extremely helpful in sharing tips and finding support. You can share ideas about recipes, restaurants, and any other topics that can be beneficial.\n\nStep 9: Note any symptoms you have if you start experiencing a flare-up.\n\nSymptoms of a flare-up may include bloating, constipation or diarrhea, headache, fatigue, and irritability. Note any symptoms you have so that you can seek medical advice on how to manage them.\n\nStep 10: The FDA requires food to state that they are GF on the product's package if they are under 20 ppm, parts per million.\n\nAlways check the package for the GF label, meaning they are safe for Celiac Disease patients. The FDA requires food companies to state it on their package if they have no gluten traces of over 20 ppm, so ensure that you always check. \n\nIn conclusion, living with Celiac Disease can be manageable with the right steps. A gluten-free diet may feel like a challenge at first, but it is essential to maintaining your overall health and wellbeing. Always take precautions when eating, reading labels, and check with your healthcare provider if you experience any symptoms. You'll also find that joining a support group can be beneficial. With the right support and planning, you can live a healthy and enjoyable life with Celiac Disease.",

        "There are many different kinds of memory and each person may have an innate ability to access certain kinds of memory better than others. For example, many people have a photographic memory - they are able to remember details about large amounts of information that is presented to them very quickly. This type of memory is very useful in situations where you need to remember large amounts of information in an efficient and structured way. Another kind of memory people have a better ability for is semantic memory - knowledge of facts and concepts. We learn so much through experience, and our brains have an easier time remembering things that it has learned through experience. It is also important to note that different people prefer to use different kinds of memory for different kinds of tasks. There is no single answer to why some people have a better memory than others. People may also have a harder time learning certain things because of factors such as their educational background, general intelligence, and lifestyle choices. No one enjoys hearing that they have a worse memory than someone else, but learning techniques for improving one's own memory can make someone happier and more productive, and can also help them enjoy the company of others more. New techniques for improving memory include techniques that promote better training of memory, such as mnemonics, and techniques that help prevent forgetting, such as proper scheduling of routine activities. Learning techniques for improving memory can also include looking at situations with a more positive attitude, such as finding something to laugh about it.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the geometry of generalized Gaussian distributions. Our work aims to understand how these distributions can be fully described by their geometric properties, which are determined by their covariance matrix. Specifically, we examine how the curvature of the space containing these distributions changes as we vary their shape parameters. We then analyze a novel class of generalized Gaussian distributions, which we call \\emph{skew-symmetric}, that can model asymmetric data.\n\nTo achieve our goals, we use differential geometry techniques to study the geometry of the space of covariance matrices. We derive new expressions for quantities such as the curvature and volume element of this space, which allow us to characterize the shape of generalized Gaussian distributions. We also study the geometry of the space of skew-symmetric covariance matrices and identify a connection with the Lie algebra of skew-symmetric matrices.\n\nOur main motivation for this research is the observation that many real-world data sets have non-Gaussian distributions that exhibit asymmetry and heavy tails. Understanding the geometry of these distributions can help us develop more accurate generative models and estimation algorithms. Additionally, our work has implications for fields such as signal processing, machine learning, and statistics.",
        "Addiction is a complex and multifactorial disorder that affects a significant population worldwide. It can be defined as a persistent, compulsive behavior despite negative consequences. It can manifest in various forms such as substance abuse, gambling, or even in the excessive consumption of food or shopping. Studies have demonstrated that addiction can be highly heritable, indicating a strong genetic basis for this disorder. However, genetics alone does not explain addiction completely. The interaction of genetic and environmental factors is believed to play a crucial role in determining a person's vulnerability to addiction.\n\nSeveral environmental factors such as childhood trauma, stress, and social isolation have been associated with a higher risk of developing addictive behaviors. Childhood trauma, including physical or emotional abuse, neglect, or household dysfunction, has been linked to the development of addiction in adulthood. Stress can also significantly contribute to the development of addiction. Chronic stress can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression, which can intensify the desire to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol.\n\nMoreover, studies have suggested that personality traits may also contribute to addiction. Specifically, individuals who exhibit traits such as impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and lack of self-control may be more prone to addiction. These traits can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, which, in turn, can lead to addiction.\n\nNeurobiological factors, such as the reward system in the brain, also play a role in addiction. The dopamine reward system, which is activated by drugs of abuse, plays a vital role in the development of addiction. Individuals who have a deficient dopamine reward system may be more prone to addiction as they may require more significant amounts of stimuli to activate the reward system.\n\nIn conclusion, addiction is a complex disorder with multiple contributing factors. Genetics, environmental factors, personality traits, and neurobiological factors all may contribute to an individual's susceptibility to addiction. Understanding these factors that underlie addiction has crucial implications for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. Furthermore, early identification of individuals at high risk of developing addiction may lead to the implementation of early interventions and can significantly reduce the negative consequences of addiction.",
        "Chloroform, also known as trichloromethane, was first produced in the 1820s, and was widely used as a surgical anesthetic during the mid-1800s. Chloroform is an organic compound with a sweet, pleasant odor and taste that makes it difficult to detect without specialized equipment. It is a volatile, highly flammable liquid at room temperature and pressure, with an odor threshold of 0.6 parts per million. Chloroform is also slightly toxic when ingested or exposed to the skin, especially when in high concentrations.\n\nThe chemical structure of chloroform explains its anesthetic effects. The molecule contains three carbon atoms and one chlorine atom, making it a halogenated hydrocarbon. Its wide structure, combined with its low boiling point, allows it to dissolve easily in fat and other liquid molecules throughout the body, leading to its anesthetic effects.\n\nChloroform acts on the central nervous system to block the signal pathways between the brain and the rest of the body. This occurs by disrupting the nervous system’s neurotransmitters, which transmit signals across the synaptic cleft. This disruption is called an “anesthetic effect” and can lead to a state of deep unconsciousness and deprive the body of sensory input and impression.\n\nChloroform can be dangerous if inhaled, as it has direct and dangerous effects on the central nervous system. The inhalation of chloroform can lead to dizziness, numbness, convulsions, and, in extreme cases, cardiac arrest. It can also cause painful headaches, pulmonary edema, and other potentially long-term medical complications if overexposed. Consequently, due to the health risks of chloroform, it is no longer used as an anesthetic in clinical settings or for recreational purposes.",

        "The Frozen Borderline – 1968–1970 was a period in the history of Korea marked by an unprecedented series of military confrontations between North and South Korea. This period saw an escalation of tensions between the two countries, with both sides engaging in several violent clashes along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) or the Korean border. The tensions between the two countries began to escalate significantly on January 21, 1968, when a North Korean infiltration unit attempted to assassinate the South Korean president, Park Chung-hee. This incident led to increased border security and a heightened military presence on both sides of the Korean border, as both countries prepared for possible war. Over the next two years, there were numerous violent and deadly incidents along the DMZ, including skirmishes, ambushes, and even a naval battle. In the most significant of these, North Korean forces attacked the USS Pueblo, an American intelligence-gathering ship that had been patrolling off the coast of North Korea. In total, 82 American crew members were captured and held prisoner for over 11 months before being released. In response to these incidents, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution condemning North Korea's actions and calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The resolution ultimately led to the establishment of the Joint Security Area (JSA) at Panmunjom, where soldiers from both sides still stand face to face, and where meetings between North and South Korean officials are occasionally held. The frozen borderline period finally came to an end in October 1970 when North Korea agreed to a \"standstill\" agreement with the United States and South Korea, effectively signaling a freeze to actual conflict. This period was marked by which South Korea was on high alert and worked towards readiness for a defense against North Korea. This lead to greater militarization of South Korea, turning it into a power that could defend itself and eventually made it one of the most developed countries in the world.",
        "Singer is a title given to performers who perform a single repertoire of songs, usually for a live performing audience. The exact definition of \"singer\" varies according to musical genre and historical period. In early music, a singer was typically the leader or instigator of a musical ensemble. This leadership may have been hereditary, as with boy sopranos in 16th-century Italy. Later, the term applied to solo improvisers who were typically credentialed professionals; amateur singers like poor singers are a 20th- and 21st-century phenomenon. Performers who compete in the Modern Olympics, including solo Bach Cantatas, are also often called singers. In the modern performing arts, \"singer\" can also be a gender-neutral term for a performer of any gender. In popular music, it is often used to denote a lead singer or lead performer of a group, who may or may not be the only vocalist in the band. A lead singer is often the principal composer or co-composer of songs, and their role is most often instrumental in helping to define the image and sound of the band or group. Buddhism and Hinduism[edit] Singing plays a central role in Buddhism and Hinduism, where it is often considered sacred spiritual practice. Theravada Buddhism prohibits the use of music that is loud, beautiful, or impressive for the purpose of entertainment, although musical instruments may be played in Buddhist temples for religious purposes. Hinduism permits the use of any type of music, even drums and dance, for religious ceremonies. In Indian classical music, there are five main vocal styles: including Carnatic music, Hindustani music, Benarasi music, Omkara music and Thumri. Singing is considered one of the pillars of Classical dance of India. Dances like Bharat Natyam, Kathak, Khayal, and Hadai are considered incomplete without vocal artistry. The legendary Natyacharya – Padmâvatshotra Brahmanand Charshrathil – is attributed with unifying these different vocal styles into one discipline. Kuchipudi is one of the most renowned and popular classical dance styles of India, originated as a theatrical performance style. Konkani, a variety of Marathi, is another prominent example of the ancient and sacred tradition of singing in Indian Classical Music. The praise and glory of God is the primary theme in Konkani Music. Western classical music[edit] A music performer or singer is called a performer or singer in Western classical music. The \"opera singer\" title is used for a distinctive performer variety in Wagnerian opera, and is not used in other European repertories, which tend to use the term \"singer\" for the original interpretation of music in a spoken style. In the standard notation of music, the vocal part is not differentiated in the way that instrumental parts are, and the voice part is sometimes not shown at all. This implies that there can be more than one performer of the text, and that each performer may use a different interpretation of the meaning of the text. Thus a singer may sing one phrase differently from another singer, or a singer may improvise a line. This diversity of interpretation was the basis of a long running dispute about the nature of the performer profession. After the Second World War, an international performers' union, the World Federation of International Performing Arts (WFIPA), was formed to manage performers' contracts and professional interests.",
        "PLease consider this paper for review as it looks interesting and potentially useful in my research. However, I have some comments and suggestions for the authors to consider. First, in the abstract, the authors describe the proposed model as semi-supervised, but the model is actually unsupervised. Please change this to semi-supervised. Second, although the model is evaluated on a semi-supervised task, the paper only reports evaluation on a fully labelled dataset. It would be helpful to report evaluation on the semi-supervised set also. Third, currently, the model only predicts the predominant class for each text, but does not attempts to classify the text into multiple finer-grained categories. I think this is important in many applications, for example, classification of customer support tickets into multiple service categories. Please consider adding this functionality. Fourth, some algorithms in the comparison list are not included in the implementation of the model. For example, LightGBM and Syntax-based pruning were used in the comparison. Please ensure that the authors implementation of the model is compliant with the comparison. Overall, this is a useful contribution.

        "Overall, this is an interesting theoretical paper discussing the applications of neural networks to functional languages. I have some major concerns about the approach that the author takes and some problems with the mathematics behind some of the claims that are made. First, the language that the author uses to illustrate functional concepts in neural networks is an imperative language with loops. This is problematic because the author is then trying to demonstrate that a neural network can be programmed in a functional style, but the example code is not functional. The author should show that a neural network can be implemented using a functional language by writing the code in the functional style. The author argues that neural networks can be used to implement representational reconfigurability. He gives an example of a recurrent neural network used to compute a differentiable function of its input where the representation of the input is the weights and the state of the network. This is true, but there are other ways to achieve this goal. For example, the code for a neural network can also contain the code for a derivative approximation module, which would allow for the same functionality to be implemented using a non-functional style. The author claims that neural networks can do arbitrary computation in the sense that they can be programmed using an inductive principle. This claim is based on using backpropagation to compute the gradient of an output with respect to a computation using the theorem that a neural network can be interpreted as a computation of an element of the infinite product of tensors over the natural numbers. This claim is very surprising because neural networks were originally developed to work on structured data like images and grayscale values, and the theorem used here is for tensors over the integers. The strengths that the author identifies in neural networks do not seem to be based on the mathematics in the article. The author mentions the combination of universal approximation ability and ability to represent continuous relationships. However, the neural networks in the paper are not using the architecture that has been found to have these properties (i.e., deep neural networks with a small number of layers). Overall, the research in this article seems to be promising, but there are some problems with the mathematical underpinnings. I recommend revising the article to make it less about functional languages and more about neural networks in general and the mathematical underpinnings of the article should be more empirically driven.",
        "William Guy was a Scottish physician and epidemiologist who made significant contributions to public health during the 19th century. Guy was born in 1810 in Forfarshire, Scotland, and initially trained as a surgeon. After completing his medical studies, he worked at the London Foundling Hospital, where he observed and treated many cases of infectious disease. He eventually became interested in the study of public health and epidemiology, and began conducting research on various diseases, including cholera and typhus. In 1847, Guy was appointed as the first medical officer of health for the city of London. In this role, he was responsible for collecting and analyzing data on public health and disease outbreaks, as well as implementing measures to prevent the spread of disease. He was a strong advocate for improving sanitation and hygiene, and his efforts led to significant improvements in the health of Londoners. Guy also played a key role in the development of the field of epidemiology. He wrote several influential works on the subject, including \"Lectures on the Theory and Practice of Medical Police\" and \"Principles of Forensic Medicine\". These works helped to establish epidemiology as a distinct field of study, and laid the groundwork for future advances in public health. In addition to his work as a physician and epidemiologist, Guy was also a prominent social reformer. He was a member of the Society of Friends, and was actively involved in many campaigns for social justice, including the abolition of slavery and the improvement of working conditions for laborers. Guy passed away in 1885, but his contributions to public health and epidemiology continue to be recognized and celebrated today. He is remembered as a pioneering figure in the field of public health, and his work continues to inspire researchers and practitioners around the world.",

The John Webber Memorial Lecture Series is held annually by the Department of Business and Managerial Economics and strives to continue his legacy of economic leadership and creative thinking.",
        " The cursor grass mouse (Microtus Cursor) is a species of vole found primarily in the grasslands of North America. It is a medium-sized mouse, measuring about 4-4.5 inches long. The body is stout, with large ears, strong claws and a long tail, which is used for balance. The fur of the cursor grass mouse is usually brown or black on the sides and has white patches on the back, cheeks and throat. The winter coat is much thicker with longer and softer fur. The eyes are small and black, with a large nose. The tail is thin and has white stripes. The cursor grass mouse is nocturnal and lives in a burrow that it dig in grasslands, fields and pastures. They are omnivorous, consuming the seeds and bulbs of grasses, as well as some fruits, invertebrates, small amphibians and occasionally small mammals. A single pair of cursor grass mice typically claims a territory of approximately 1000 square feet, which they will defend against other mice. Breeding takes place in the spring and summer, with litters of up to four young. The primary threat to the survival of this species is the loss of its natural habitat due to human activities, such as deforestation and urbanization. They are also preyed upon by several species of snake, fox and hawk. The cursor grass mouse is listed as threatened in some areas, and is a species of special concern in its native range. It can be found in protected areas, such as national parks, but due to the decline in numbers, it is listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. Despite these challenges, the cursor grass mouse remains a well-known fixture of the North American grasslands, due to its docile nature and wide distribution. As such, it is a common choice for students of biology and ecology, who use it to learn more about small mammal habitat requirements.",

Abstract:\nSchulten, Albert (Albertus) (born 29 May 1898 in Utrecht – died 16 September 1977) was a Dutch historian and archaeologist who specialized on the Roman Republic period of ancient Rome.\nHe studied at Leiden University where he received his doctorate under Jacob Cornelis van Oorschot's supervision in 1927.  He became professor there from 1931 to 1956.   In 1937 he published his first major work entitled De stad en de romanischen rijkers in which he argued that Rome had been founded by refugees fleeing the fall of Troy rather than by Etruscans as previously believed.    His second book, The Romans in Italy before the Roman Empire appeared in 1939; it is considered one of the most important works ever written about pre-Roman history.   After World War II he continued working until retirement in 1966 when he moved back home to Utrecht.   During this time he wrote several more books including two volumes on Pompeii and Herculaneum.   He also co-founded the Netherlands Institute for Archaeology (NIA), now known as NIOD - National Institute for Oriental and African Studies.

Fraser played a key role in the decommissioning of UK ballistic missiles and was knighted in the 1994 New Year's Honours for service to the community. Fraser's father, Sir Harold Fraser, 4th Baronet, was also a high-ranking British military officer, but died when Sir Keith was only five years old. He was brought up by his mother, Margaret (née Davis), and his maternal grandparents, Lionel and Lucy Davis. He attended Repton School and then Christ Church, University of Oxford where he graduated with a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. While at Oxford, he played varsity hockey. He also held a commission in the Royal Armoured Corps, where he was appointed Second Lieutenant in 1955. In 1957, he transferred to the Royal Horse Artillery and was promoted to Captain in 1959. Fraser worked at Shell from 1959 to 1964, and then at Pilatus Airlines from 1964 to 1969. He had joined Pilatus in Switzerland, and worked there in order to avoid the military service that was required of him by law at that time. In 1969, Fraser became the managing director of Samuel Montagu & Co. He worked for the family firm, established in 1666, until 1984 when he became the chairman and led the company until 2001. In 1983, Fraser was created a baronet, of Fulham in the County of Middlesex. He has three sons from his first marriage to Angela Katherine Furse. In June 2002, Fraser was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2003 New Year Honours. On 16 September 2009, he was made a Freeman of the City of London. In 2010, Fraser was voted Businessman of the Year by the Institute of Public Administration.",
        "It's difficult to estimate the exact amount of damage that an ant-sized nuclear bomb would cause. Firstly, it's essential to understand that nuclear bombs work by creating a chain reaction of nuclear fission and/or fusion, leading to an enormous release of energy in the form of heat, light, and radiation. The size of the explosion depends on the amount of energy released (measured in kilotons or megatons), the altitude at which the bomb detonates, and the surrounding terrain.\n\nAssuming we're talking about a hypothetical ant-sized nuclear bomb, which means it would be significantly smaller than any existing nuclear weapon, it's challenging to predict the exact amount of damage it would do. However, we can make some inferences based on the general principles of nuclear explosions.\n\nFirstly, it's safe to assume that the size of the explosion would be tiny, probably no more significant than a small firework. However, even a small nuclear explosion can release significant amounts of ionizing radiation, which could be hazardous to living creatures in the immediate vicinity. \n\nIn terms of physical damage, the explosion might create a small hole or crater in whatever surface it detonated, but it is unlikely to destroy anything significant. If anything, it would mostly be a proof-of-concept device or a research tool to study the properties of nuclear reactions on a minuscule scale. \n\nOverall, we can only speculate on the specific effects of an ant-sized nuclear bomb, as it remains purely a theoretical concept.",
        "A breakthrough in the studies of the epoch of recombination, when the gas present in the Universe became ionized, was the detection of the signal from the hydrogen 2p--2s transition. Thesignal, whose energy was equal to the energy difference between the 2p and 2s states of hydrogen atoms, could be observed in the spectra of distant quasars. The obtained results were interpreted in the context of the \"recombination scenario\" of the structure formation, which assumes that the Universe is spatially uniform at a very large scales, with the distribution of matter corresponding to the cold dark matter model. The amplitude of the signal agreed with theoretical predictions, providing an additional confirm for the validity of the cosmological principle and verifying one of the main theoretical predictions of the Big Bang. However, the obtained results were contradictory to the findings of several other teams, which reported the non-observation of the signal in the same quasar spectra. The reason for this discrepancy is the detection of the signal also from the epoch of reionization, which occurred some 600,000 years after the Big Bang. The signal from the 2p--2s transition was not observed in this period due to the attenuation of the Universe's transparency to electromagnetic radiation caused by the residual free electrons. The results of the studies of the 2p--2s transition signal contributed to a solution of the existing controversy and confirmed the consistency of the cosmological research, extending the verification of one of the key predictions of the Big Bang theory to a period of the early cosmological history.",
        "The English victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 was certainly a shocking outcome, albeit one that was mythologized far beyond its reality. A great upset against a major global superpower, many historians view this as one of the great Anglo-Spanish conflicts of the 16th century. \n\nThe Spanish were undoubtedly very powerful at the time, under the rule of Philip II. The Spanish Armada was a determined and powerful force, composed of 128 vessels, 19.000 sailors and 18.000 soldiers. It was expected that this huge and powerful force could easily overpower the smaller and much younger English navy.\n\nHowever, the English navy had some distinct advantages. England had far better-trained sailors than its Spanish counterparts. England also possessed a larger navy than Spain, and its ships were also lighter and faster than Spain’s. Furthermore, England was better prepared for battle, with more powerful guns and a well-organised strategy of attack.\n\nMost importantly, the English navy had a far better understanding of the geography, the currents and the winds of the English Channel. This was a huge advantage for the English, as it allowed them to repel Spanish vessels who, not understanding the nature of their own movements, often ended up being in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\nIn conclusion, the English victory over the Spanish Armada was not only surprising but also a testament to the strength of England’s navy at the time, which was far greater than that of the Spanish.",

        "Title: Exploring Sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nAuthors: John Smith, Alice Johnson, and Mark Lee\n\nIntroduction:\nThe paper explores the effects of sparsity in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). It investigates the benefits of incorporating sparsity to enhance the performance of RNNs for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n\nApproach:\nThe authors carry out a series of experiments to study the impact of sparsity on RNNs. They use three different NLP datasets and experiment with different levels of sparsity to optimize the performance of the RNNs. The authors compare the performance of the sparse RNNs with the dense RNNs to evaluate the efficacy of sparsity.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe paper presents a thorough analysis of the effects of sparsity on RNNs. The experiments show that sparse RNNs perform better than their dense counterparts. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the factors contributing to the improved performance of sparse RNNs such as reduced overfitting and improved generalization capacity.\n\nThe authors also compare the performance of their method to other state-of-the-art techniques for optimizing RNN performance. However, the authors do not provide a significant improvement over these baseline methods, which limits the novelty of their contribution. Additionally, the paper lacks a theoretical justification for why sparsity improves the performance of RNNs, which could have added to the impact of the paper.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, the paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of sparsity on RNNs for NLP tasks. The experiments conducted are sound, and the results presented robustly support the authors’ claims. However, the paper could have made a more significant contribution to the field by proposing a theoretical explanation for the observed improvements in performance. Nonetheless, the paper provides a useful reference for researchers interested in incorporating sparsity into RNNs for NLP tasks.",

        "In classical physics, a particle is considered too small to cast a shadow when its area is smaller than the area of a proton. However, in quantum physics, this definition of “too small” is altered. According to the Schrödinger Equation, a particle with a zero area does not exist because the equation requires a factor of zero, which is an invalid mathematical operation. According to the equation, a zero-area particle is a valid concept. One can speculate that because the Schrödinger Equation takes into account the uncertainty in the geometry of particles, a zero-area particle would not be able to produce a cast shadow. Since shadows are formed by light reaching a surface, and since light interacts with a particle according to the Schrödinger Equation, the shadows of zero-area particles would also have to be considered invalid. This means that zero-area particles can form shadows, and particles are considered too small to cast a shadow when discussing the subject of quantum physics.",

        " Mantis is a genus of the family mantidae containing over 2,400 species of large predatory insects. Mantis belong to a large group of insects within the order Mantodea, typically characterized by a specialized head, legs adapted for gripping prey, segmented body, and remarkable praying behavior. The suborder Mantodea is comprised of many different genera and species, with Mantidae - the mantis family - counting for approximately 80% of all mantodean species. Mantises are widespread and can be found in temperate and tropical habitats around the world. Most species of mantis have a three-stage lifecycle, consisting of egg, nymph and adult stages. Females typically have a mottled brown coloration while males are usually lighter colored with longer and more active wings. During mating, the male typically performs a \"dance\" to entice the female, and the male will often perform acrobatics including somersaults to evade the female's grasp. Mantoideans exhibit a variety of behaviors, including the fascinating praying behavior in which they raise their front legs to appear as if they are in prayer. Their front legs are extremely sensitive and are used to detect nearby prey such as small flies, crickets and other small invertebrates. Thesis are both beneficial and pest species, as they generally feed on other insects. They have been introduced to many areas as a form of natural pest control, and are sometimes used in displays in gardens and zoos. Some species, such as the African Mantis, have become an invasive species in many parts of the world. In addition to its use as a form of pest control, Mantis are also popular as hobbyists. They are generally easy to keep and make an interesting addition to an insect collection. There are even specialized websites devoted to the keeping of mantids and many species of mantis have been bred in captivity. The most commonly available species of mantis are the Chinese Mantis and the European Mantis. They are popular due to their large size, attractive colors, and ease of care. Mantis can make a great addition to any insect enthusiast’s collection and provide a fascinating view into the world of hunting insects. They are a great way to learn about their behavior while also helping provide natural pest control.",

        "László Szőgyény-Marich Sr. (born Leopold Lőwenstein; 22 April 1871 – 6 February 1934) was a leading pioneer in radio communication in Hungary. While visiting Switzerland in 1904, he performed the first radio transmission of sound, transmitting the song \"Il Sollieva L'aura\" by Giacomo Meyerbeer. From 1905, he worked in Austria-Hungary's Imperial and Royal Geographic Institute, and used his military experience to create a unified state in the region. Following the First World War, he was a high-ranking officer of the new Hungarian National Council in Transylvania. He was also the leader of the Hungarian nationalist political party Magyar Hadnagászati Társaság (Hungarian Philological Society). Szőgyény-Marich was born in what is today Romania, to a Jewish family. In 1896, he graduated from the University of Budapest, where he studied philosophy. He changed his surname to Szőgyén-Marich in 1901 in order to further his career. His first radio address was \"Lám, Lám, Lám\". Following his 1904 transmission of sound, he was hired by the Imperial and Royal Geographic Institute. Later, he worked for the Hungarian News Agency and the Hungarian Radio Station.

        "\n\nThe paper \"From BLEU to RAINBOW: Why We Need New Metrics for NLG\" addresses the problem of evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems using automatic metrics that are weakly correlated with human judgments. The authors investigate a range of metrics currently used in NLG evaluation and demonstrate that they perform poorly in distinguishing outputs of medium and high quality. They attribute this partly to the fact that automatic metrics and human judgments are on different scales. The authors suggest an alternative metric called RAINBOW that combines the individual strengths of different automatic scores and achieves better correlation with human judgments on the sentence level.\n\nStrengths:\nThe paper provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of existing automatic metrics for NLG evaluation. The authors identify the limitations of these metrics and present a novel metric that performs better in correlating with human judgments. The paper is well-structured and easy to understand. The experiments are carefully designed and conducted, allowing clear comparisons of different metrics and systems.\n\nWeaknesses:\nThe paper could have benefited from a deeper discussion of the limitations of the RAINBOW metric. While it achieves better correlation with human judgments than existing metrics, it is still not perfect and may have its own limitations. The paper could have also discussed the practical implications of the findings, such as how the RAINBOW metric could be used in practice and whether it would require new annotation efforts.\n\nOverall, I find the paper to be an important contribution to the field of NLG evaluation. The authors clearly demonstrate the limitations of existing metrics and propose a novel metric that is more effective in capturing the quality of generated sentences. I recommend this paper for publication, but with the caveat that the authors should provide more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed metric.",
        "\n\nDo you have an acute opiate addiction? You know it’s a huge problem, yet you may feel powerless to stop it. You’re not alone when it comes to opiate withdrawal, so you should learn how to cope and eventually break free from your addiction. There are many techniques that you can use to make the process more manageable. Here are some tips on how to endure acute withdrawal from opiates.\n\n1. Purchase Over-the-Counter Analgesics\n\nThis is one of the best things you can do if you’re having a difficult time managing opiate withdrawal. Many over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help to reduce inflammation and ease muscle aches associated with opiate withdrawal.\n\n2. Buy an Antihistamine with Sedating Effects\n\nSometimes, anti-inflammatory medications don’t do enough to manage the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. An antihistamine with sedating effects can be helpful in reducing feelings of anxiety, jitteriness, and agitation during withdrawal.\n\n3. Get Medication to Treat Diarrhea\n\nDiarrhea is an incredibly unpleasant symptom of opiate withdrawal. You may be able to alleviate some of the cramping and discomfort that comes with it by taking a medication such as loperamide, Pepto-Bismol, or Imodium.\n\n4. Buy 2-Week Supplies of Your Over-the-Counter Medications\n\nWhen you’re dealing with withdrawal, it’s important to make sure that you have enough of any medications you may need. Buying a two-week supply of any over-the-counter medications you’re taking will help you to have enough on hand to make sure that you don’t run out in case of an emergency.\n\n5. Ask Your Doctor About Clonidine\n\nClonidine is a drug that is used to help reduce the severity of opiate withdrawal symptoms. It can reduce the level of agitation and anxiety that come with withdrawal as well as help to reduce the intensity of the physical side effects.\n\n6. Try Subutex/Suboxone (Buprenorphine) If You've Been on Narcotics for a Long Time\n\nIf you’ve been on opiates for a long time, it may be beneficial to try Subutex or Suboxone, both of which contain buprenorphine. They are commonly used to help reduce the intensity of withdrawal symptoms and can also help to reduce cravings.\n\n7. Take Diazepam (Valium) or Clonazepam (Klonopin)\n\nDiazepam and clonazepam are benzodiazepines that can help to reduce anxiety and agitation that may be associated with opiate withdrawal. They can also help to slowly taper down the symptoms and can be used in conjunction with Subutex or Suboxone.\n\n8. Think About Using Some Lower-Level Controlled Substances If They’re Legal in Your Country or State\n\nIn some countries or states, there may be some alternatives to opiates that are legal such as cannabis, kratom, or other psychotropic substances. These can be helpful in mitigating withdrawal symptoms in situations where pharmaceuticals may not be available or accessible.\n\n9. Know What Symptoms to Expect So That Nothing Catches You by Surprise\n\nIt’s important to have a good understanding of the symptoms of opiate withdrawal so that you’re prepared for them when they come. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, sweating, fatigue, and restlessness. Understanding the symptoms ahead of time can help to better manage them if and when they arise.\n\n10. Prepare a Comfortable Environment\n\nIt’s important to have a comfortable environment that you can retreat to during times of withdrawal. Make sure that your space is clean, uncluttered, well-lit, and conducive to rest and relaxation.\n\n11. Avoid Going Through Withdrawal Alone\n\nGoing through withdrawal can be a difficult experience, and it’s important to have the support of others. It could be helpful to have a trusted friend stay with you as you go through the process or to have other forms of support, such as online forums or support groups.\n\n12. Take Some Time off From Your Usual Activities\n\nDuring withdrawal, it can be helpful to take some time to focus solely on recovery. Take a break from your normal routine and let yourself focus on the process of recovering from your addiction.\n\n13. Slowly Taper Off Your Narcotics\n\nIt can be tempting to try to quit opiates “cold turkey”, but it’s not the best approach. The best way to manage opiate withdrawal is to slowly taper off your narcotics over a period of several weeks or months.\n\n14. Try Community Detox\n\nCommunity detox programs can be helpful for those trying to recover from opiate addiction. They provide a safe and supportive environment where you can get all the help you need to manage withdrawal symptoms and work to remain clean.\n\n15. Go to a Psychiatric Ward or Other Inpatient Psychiatric Facility If You’ve Had Episodes of Suicidal Thoughts or Hurting Yourself in the Past\n\nIf you’ve had any past episodes of suicidal thoughts or self-harm, it’s important to get help from an inpatient psychiatric facility. Going to these facilities can help to ensure that you have access to the support and safety you need during the withdrawal process.\n\n16. Check Yourself Into a Rehabilitation Facility\n\nRehabilitation facilities provide intensive psychotherapy and addiction counseling that can be helpful in the withdrawal process. Staying in a rehabilitation facility can also help to provide a more controlled environment where you can focus on getting sober.\n\n17. Give Yourself a Lot of Positive Reinforcement\n\nIt’s important to give yourself lots of positive reinforcement during the withdrawal process. Remind yourself that you’re doing something very difficult but worthwhile. Celebrate the victories, big and small.\n\n18. Remember to Eat Food and Drink Water\n\nWhen going through withdrawal, it’s important to take care of your body and make sure that you’re consuming enough food and water. Listen to your body when it’s telling you that you need to eat or drink.\n\n19. Get Some Light Exercise\n\nPhysical activity can be helpful in managing the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Taking a walk or doing some light stretching can help to burn off excess energy and provide an emotional boost.\n\n20. Believe in Yourself\n\nYour recovery process isn’t just about the physical symptoms. Developing a belief in yourself – that you can overcome your addiction – is a crucial step in the recovery process.\n\n21. Quit for Yourself and Not for Anyone Else\n\nYou’re the one who’s going through withdrawal, so it’s important to remember that you’re the one in charge. Don’t let anyone else’s expectations and opinions stand in the way of your recovery journey.\n\n22. Join Narcotics Anonymous or SMART Recovery\n\nSupport groups are a great source of support during the recovery process. Joining an organization such as Narcotics Anonymous or SMART Recovery can provide both camaraderie and helpful advice from people who have gone through similar experiences.\n\n23. Associate with the Right People\n\nPeople who are in recovery need to make sure that they’re associating with the right people. Avoid those who are still actively using drugs; instead, try to find people who can provide you with social support and understanding.\n\n24. Prepare for the Process of Overcoming Addiction to Take a Long Time\n\nFinally, it’s important to understand that overcoming addiction is not a quick or easy process. It will take time, and it’s important to be patient with yourself and understand that progress comes in baby steps.\n\nRecovering from an opiate addiction is a difficult and challenging process. It takes a great deal of dedication, hard work, and perseverance in order to endure the acute withdrawal symptoms. By following these tips, however, you can make the process much more manageable. Remember: you can do this!",
        "In this work, we investigate the catalytic effect of black hole motion on the resonant dynamics of planetary systems. Resonances between planet orbits play a significant role in shaping the long-term evolution of planetary systems and have important implications for habitability. However, understanding the mechanisms that drive resonance capture and evolution remains a challenge in this field. \n\nWe propose that black hole motion can act as a trigger for resonance capture by stretching and compressing the orbits of the planets, destabilizing some and stabilizing others. We use N-body simulations to test this hypothesis and confirm that the resonance capture probability increases significantly when a black hole is present in the system. Moreover, we find that black holes can also drive resonance jumps, causing significant changes in the semi-major axes of the planets. \n\nOur findings suggest that black hole motion should be considered as an important factor in the dynamical evolution of planetary systems. This work opens up new avenues for research into the formation and evolution of planetary systems in galactic environments. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of multi-scale studies that incorporate black holes in the context of planet formation and evolution, and broader astrophysical applications.",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"The Stueckelberg Extension and Milli Weak and Milli Charge Dark Matter\".\nAbstract:\nWe propose that the dark matter in our universe is composed of milli-charged particles, which are neutral under electromagnetism but carry an electric charge on the order of 10^(-6)e (electrons). We show how this scenario can be realized within the context of the Standard Model by introducing a new gauge boson with mass mX ~ 1TeV/c2 into the theory through the Stueckelberg extension to the Standard Model. The introduction of such a massive vector particle leads to modifications to the usual Feynman rules for charged fermions interacting via photons or gluons. In particular, we find that the cross section for scattering between two milli-charged particles mediated by a photon is suppressed compared to the case where there were no additional massive vector boson present. This suppression results in a reduction of the number density of milli-charged dark matter particles at late times as they annihilate more slowly than their un-massive counterparts.",
        "\n\nHow to Sew Bench Cushions\n\nCreating bench cushions is a great way to add a stylish and comfortable touch to any indoor or outdoor furniture. By knowing the basics of sewing, it is possible to make your own bench cushion to take the comfort level to the next level. Here are the steps on how to sew bench cushions.\n\nGather the following supplies: fabric, upholstery foam, matching thread, pins, straight pins, scissors, marking chalk, staple gun and staples.\n\nMeasure the flat seat of the bench - length and depth and add an inch to each for the seam allowances. Cut seven pieces of fabric; two that are equal to the measured length plus a half inch, and two that are equal to the measured depth plus a half inch. The sides of the sewn cushion cover will need to be 3 inches to accommodate the 3 inch upholstery foam. Measure two long strips of fabric 41 inches by 4 inches. Cut out all seven pieces of fabric, taking care to cut each side as straight as possible.\n\nMark the fabric. Begin by laying out the biggest piece of fabric right or \"good\" side up. At each corner, mark the half inch in from the edge with a circle, dot, or other mark indicate you'll be sewing the seam there. Position your needle so the first stitch will enter the fabric at the dot or circle you've drawn half an inch in from the corner.\n\nLay out the main fabric piece with the long strips sewn on, right or \"good\" side up. Starting and ending at your corner marks, sew the shorter strips to each side of the main piece, avoiding the long fabric strips. Take care that the strips are lined up just the way you want them to be; once stitched they are not easily adjustable.\n\nNext, add a hem. Double fold all four sides of the main piece by bringing one side to the other and folding it over. Pin the hem in place and sew it shut. To complete the cushion cover, pin the loose ends of the larger back piece to the long end of the long side piece, again taking care to avoid any seam allowances. Sew from the corner mark right along the long edge and over the hemmed end of the back piece. Taking care not to cut into your stitching, clip each corner so the extra fabric won't bunch inside.\n\nTurn your cushion cover right side out. Insert the upholstery foam by tucking one end of the foam under the larger piece on the back of your cover first, then putting the rest in under the smaller piece. At one corner of your cushion, pull your fabric tight over the foam and staple it together in a few places. Do the same for the remaining corners. For extra comfort, consider adding two thin pieces of batting between the fabric and the foam before stapling along the edges.\n\nYour homemade bench cushion is now complete! You can easily remove the cover to clean or replace the foam when necessary. With a few simple items and a bit of time, you can transform your bench into a cozy spot to relax in.",

        "The debris disk around the A star AU Mic was observed in infrared with the Gemini North telescope and with the Hubble Space Telescope. The Hubble observations revealed tenuous dust with size of a few microns, while the ground-based observations revealed also tenuous dust with sizes of tens of microns. The large differences in the inferred sizes of the dust grains could be explained if the debris disk is asymmetric with a significantly higher concentration of dust around AU Mic than around the star itself. To model the observations, we ran three different numerical simulations. In the first simulation, the dust was allowed to drift under the influence of Poynting-Robertson and stellar wind drag forces. The modeling predicted dust distributions that were too uniform to explain the observations. The second simulation, in which the dust was placed on initial eccentric orbits, also did not provide a good fit to the data. In the third simulation, the dust was placed on initially circular orbits and subjected to radiation pressure and gravitational interactions with the dust. The model with this prescription was able to produce a debris disk with a radial power-law distribution of dust consistent with the observations.",
        "Write a long abstract of a scientific paper from arXiv.org. Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Hall drift of axisymmetric magnetic fields in solid neutron-star matter\".\nAbstract:\nWe study the Hall effect for an axisymmetric magnetic field in a dense plasma with degenerate electrons and non-degenerate ions, which is relevant to the interior of a neutron star. We find that the Hall current density depends on the direction of the magnetic field relative to the rotation vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ as well as its magnitude. The dependence on the direction arises because the electron velocity distribution function becomes anisotropic due to the Lorentz force exerted by the magnetic field. This leads to a difference between the longitudinal and transverse conductivities even when the magnetic field is parallel to the rotation vector. In addition, we show that the Hall conductivity tensor has off-diagonal components if the magnetic field is not aligned with the rotation vector. These results are obtained using kinetic theory combined with the relaxation-time approximation. \nThe Hall effect plays an important role in various astrophysical phenomena such as pulsar winds and magnetars. It also affects the evolution of the magnetic field inside a neutron star through Ohmic dissipation. \n \n Neutron stars have extremely strong magnetic fields ($10^{14}-10^{16}\\text{ G}$) at their surfaces [1] . Their interiors contain superfluid neutrons, superconducting protons, and degenerate electrons [2] , all of which can be strongly influenced by the magnetic field [3] . For example, it was recently shown [4] that the presence of a toroidal magnetic field causes the crustal lattice structure of a neutron star to become unstable against shear deformations. Therefore, understanding how these different physical ingredients interact with each other under extreme conditions is crucial for modeling realistic neutron stars.",
        "H2CO is an important prebiotic molecule, involved in the production of more complex biomolecules such as nucleotides and amino acids. L1204 and S140 are two adjacent clouds in the solar neighborhood. Observations of H2CO in these two clouds show that H2CO exists in two different states. In one case it appears as discrete cores with cometary shapes of about 0.2 pc in length, temperature of about 20 K, and linewidth of about 0.2 km/s. In the other case it appears as a ring-like structure around dense cores with temperature of about 10 K and linewidth of about 0.15 km/s. The difference between these two structures has not been explained. We suggest that the difference in the H2CO structure may be related to the existence of a surrounding core of warm molecular hydrogen. The formation of this molecular hydrogen may be due to the photodissociation of H2CO at 6 cm wavelength. In this case, the existence of warm molecular hydrogen would prevent the formation of cometary H2CO cores.",

        "The Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" has long been a cultural touchstone, and the lyrics you mention certainly contribute to its mystique. The song's reference to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is widely understood as a reference to the political and social turbulence of the 1960s, and more specifically to the idea that a sense of collective guilt was shared by the entire nation in the wake of that tragic event.\n\nIn terms of any stigma surrounding music and TV references to Kennedy's death, it's worth noting that the cultural landscape of the mid- to late-1960s was characterized by an explosion of creative expression across all mediums. This was a time of social upheaval and political dissent, and many artists felt emboldened to explore controversial subject matter in their work.\n\nAt the same time, however, there was certainly no shortage of criticism and backlash aimed at musicians and other artists who explored political issues in their work. Some critics argued that such work was disrespectful or even unpatriotic, while others saw it as a necessary form of social commentary in a tumultuous time.\n\nUltimately, it's clear that the Kennedy assassination was a heavy and haunting presence in the cultural consciousness of the 1960s, and that many artists felt compelled to grapple with its legacy in their work. Whether or not there was a stigma around such references is difficult to say, but it's clear that they were an important part of a wide-ranging conversation about politics and society that took place across all sectors of American culture.",
        " Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings are a type of complex dynamical systems used to model and study the behavior of various physical and biological phenomena. These systems use the complex number plane to represent the states and evolutions of a particular system. Such periodic points are particularly useful in understanding and formulating chaotic and nonlinear behavior in a variety of systems. The simplest type of quadratic mapping takes a point and applies the rule $(z_n)^2 + c$, with $(z_n)$ being the nth complex number and c being a constant complex number. This rule will then yield a new complex number, which is used as the next point in the mapping. By iterating the above equation, the values of the complex number will start to form a pattern starting from the initial point. These patterns can then be studied and used to understand the behavior of a complex system. Periodic points are a special type of point which, after a certain number of iterations, returns to its initial value. This behavior is known as periodicity, and it is possible to study the periodic points of a system by analyzing the number of iterations it takes for a point to return back to its initial value. Specifically, the number of iterations is known as the period and can be used to identify the periodicity of the system. The study of periodic points of complex quadratic mappings has a wide range of applications. For example, they can be used to study chaotic behavior in systems, such as in the turbulent flow of liquids, where it is important to identify regions of chaotic behavior. They can also be used to study complex nonlinear phenomena such as chaos in the Sun’s atmosphere, in chemical reactions, and in biological systems, such as the growth of plants or the migratory behavior of birds. Overall, the study of periodic points of complex quadratic mappings provides a powerful tool for understanding and modeling complex systems. By identifying periodic points and studying their periodicity, researchers can gain insight into chaotic behavior and other nonlinear phenomena.",

        "The hormones produced by that part of the plant's stem called apical meristem, which is located at its tip (the growing end). The hormone auxin causes branches to form in certain areas and not others.  Auxin levels are higher near the tips than elsewhere along stems; this means that new growth occurs there first.   If an area has high auxin concentration it becomes more likely that a branch will develop from that point. Hormones also determine where shoots or leaves will appear as well as how they grow out of the stem. High concentrations of auxin cause shoots to grow outward rather than upward. Apical meristem cells divide rapidly so that each cell produces two daughter cells instead of one. This rapid division results in increased production of auxin causing branches to form.

        "In this work, we investigate the molecular line emission from massive protostellar disks to make predictions for ALMA and the EVLA. The motivation for this research is to understand the formation of massive stars and their associated disks, which are crucial for the formation of planetary systems. By analyzing the molecular line emission from these disks, we can gain insights into the physical and chemical processes that are occurring within them.\n\nThe problem that our work attempts to solve is the lack of knowledge about the gas and dust composition in massive protostellar disks. The molecular lines we studied include CO, HCO+, and HCN, which can provide information about the disk temperature, density, and chemical composition. Moreover, we employ radiative transfer modeling to investigate the detectability of these lines, which helps to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of current and upcoming telescopes.\n\nWe present the results of our simulations, including the expected line profiles and signal-to-noise ratio for different disk models and observing setups. Our analysis shows that ALMA and the EVLA are powerful tools for studying massive protostellar disks, providing the opportunity to detect and resolve molecular emission lines in fine spatial and spectral resolution. These results highlight the potential for future observations of these systems and advance our understanding of the formation and evolution of massive stars and their associated disks.",
        "Write a long abstract of a scientific paper from arXiv.org. Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Variable Selection Incorporating Prior Constraint Information into Lasso\".\nAbstract:\nWe propose an algorithm for variable selection in high-dimensional regression problems by combining the lasso with prior information on the sparsity pattern of the solution. The proposed method is based on the idea that, if we know which variables are likely to be included or excluded from the model, then this knowledge can be used as additional constraints when solving the lasso problem. We show how these constraints can be incorporated using Lagrange multipliers and derive an efficient coordinate descent algorithm for computing the constrained lasso estimator. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach leads to substantial improvements over existing methods both in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. In particular, it outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as SIS and ISIS even though they use more sophisticated techniques than ours. \n \n Keywords: Lasso, Variable selection, High dimensional data analysis, Coordinate descent algorithm, Constraints \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n In many applications involving high-dimensional data sets, there exists some prior information about the sparsity structure of the unknown parameter vector. For example, in gene expression studies one may expect only few genes to have non-zero effects while most other genes will not contribute at all (see e.g., Tibshirani et al. (2002) ). Similarly, in text mining tasks where documents are represented as vectors of word counts, it has been shown that only very small subsets of the available features are relevant for predicting certain target values (see e.g. Witten & Bell (1991) , Joachims (1998) ). \n \n This type of prior information can be exploited within the framework of penalized least squares estimators like the LASSO (Tibshirani 1996) . However, standard approaches do not take advantage of any specific structural properties of the underlying problem beyond the fact that the number of parameters p is large compared to the sample size n . As a consequence, these methods often suffer from poor performance due to their lack of adaptivity to the true sparsity pattern of β . \n \n In this work, we consider the case where the set of active predictors A = { j :",

        "\n\nHow to Draw What You See\nDrawing can be a great outlet for creative expression, but it can also be hard to get started. Drawing something you see can be even more challenging because it requires a good eye for detail. That’s why it’s important to know the basic steps. Here's how to draw what you see correctly.\n\nThe first and most important thing to do is to prepare yourself and your tools. Get comfortable; it doesn’t matter if it’s just you, your paper, and your pencil. With small or intricate drawings, you'll need very sharp tools like razor-sharp scissors, fine-tipped tweezers, and a good eraser.\n\nTake a look at the scene or object you want to draw. After surveying your subject, use a pencil to draw whatever catches your eye. Getting everything correct the first time will be difficult, so proceed with patience and take your time. Don't use an eraser at first, as this can be too intimidating for beginners. Don't worry about mistakes; they will help you to learn and improve.\n\nRemember the general rule: objects higher up on the plane (closer to the sky) are generally smaller and farther away than objects lower, which are closer to you. Hold your arm out straight with pencil in hand. You may even find it helpful to stick your pencil out in the air between your eye and the subject, so you can accurately measure objects in your drawing in relation to one another.\n\nStart by lightly sketching the entire scene, being sure to keep the above rule in mind. Keep in mind proportion and general shapes when you draw. People’s heads are usually an oval shape, rocks should have a flat base, and animals can often be drawn using circles, ovals, and what looks like hot-dog shapes. Geometric shapes like buildings and mechanical objects will usually need a ruler or templates for accuracy.\n\nOnce you have sketched the general scene, begin to fill in slightly darker lines. Be sure to also shade in any and all areas that are not completely drenched in light. Use your own technique for this: some people use soft lines, some use criss-crosses, while others use a different technique preferred by them.\n\nFinally, use color with caution. Pencils can be sensitive and the lead can easily smear on the page. Therefore, use color sparingly. Stick to the basics, and you’ll have your picture sketched up in no time.",
        "Yes, it's been known to happen. In most cases, pensioners that over spent their pensions and went into debt ended up in a situation where they could not make ends meet. This can be especially difficult if the president had no other sources of income, such as investments or rental property, to supplement their pension. \n\nFor example, Harry Truman was known to have had finances troubles after leaving office. He was the only president to not have had a pension and was thus reliant on Secret Service protection and an annual allowance from Congress. Despite his attempt to make money from his post-presidential career with speeches, books, and other pursuits, Truman and his wife ended up in a place close to relative poverty and they were unable to pay off their bills and debts. \n\nSimilarly, it's widely known that Thomas Jefferson was quite a financial struggle. He was also the only president, aside from Truman, to not receive a pension as one wasn't set up when left office and despite having large amounts of land and resources, Jefferson was an inveterate spender, who ended up so deeply in debt that he was unable to free himself from it. \n\nFinally, James Madison was another US president that was plagued with dire financial problems. Again, he was another president that didn't receive a pension from Congress and being a spendthrift, Madison and his wife lived a life of relative poverty just to make ends meet.\n\nWhile pensions are meant to provide financial security for retirees, in some cases, it is not enough to sustain a comfortable retirement for former US presidents. In these instances, if the presidents have not made provisions for their retirement with investments or other sources of income, they may end up living a life of relative poverty or close to the middle class by the time they reach the end of their retirement.",

Testing blood sugar levels regularly is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle with diabetes. \n\nBlood sugar meters are available at most pharmacies, and sometimes you can get them for free. The only requirement is that you must have a valid prescription from your doctor. If you do not have a prescription, you can get one from your doctor and then take it to the pharmacy to get a free blood sugar meter. \n\nThere are also some organizations that give away free blood sugar meters to people with diabetes.

        " Ludolph Christian Treviranus (31 January 1779 - 24 December 1864), was a German biologist who was born in Berlin, Prussia. He began his studies with his father, a minister, who taught him Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He went to the university of Würzburg and the University of Berlin, graduating in 1800 with a degree in philosophy. Treviranus was appointed in 1805 as professor of botany and zoology at the University of Bremen and became a patron of science. As a scientist, Treviranus was a pioneer of the study of biology and in particular the physiology of plants. He wrote a significant treatise on the subject, Physiologie der Pflanzen (1824–1826), which became an influential guide to the study of the growth and development of plants. Treviranus was an early leader in the study of organic evolution, and promoted the terms \"Organization\" and \"Adaptation\" in his works. He argued that the species were originally created in a state of adaptation, but that over time, their adaptability allowed for their differentiation and diversification. This model of evolution was later modified and championed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and in the 20th century, by Charles Darwin. Treviranus also shared a love of nature with many of his contemporaries. He was an active conservationist, and was amongst the first to recognize the importance of preserving the environment of forests and marshland. He was a successful landowner and developed his own land with a model farm and waterworks. In addition to his work on plants and the environment, Treviranus was also a noted anthropologist, studying the physical and cultural characteristics of different people in both Europe and Africa. He is considered by some to be a forerunner of cultural anthropology. Ludolph Christian Treviranus died in Bremen on 24 December 1864. He has since been recognized as one of the founding fathers of biology, and as an important early figure in the development of organic evolution. His work was remembered in the naming of Treviranus Island, an island located in the Bellingshausen Sea, off the western coast of Antarctica.",
        "Heat rises because the warmth--i.e., the heat--is carried by fluid motion of hot gas in a closed system. Hot air typically follows the contours of the land and low air pressure at the surface of the Earth causes the air near the surface to be warmer. Thus, when air is breathed, you will feel the heat first near the surface where the air is warmer. Purchase a quality wind-chill calculator. When it is very cold outside, the air near the surface is much warmer than the air a few feet above the surface. If you cannot breathe the air near the surface, seek shelter immediately. But what if I'm flying in an airplane? The pressurized cabin creates an environment where the air is maintained at a relatively constant temperature. If the outside temperature is very cold, but the airplane is flying at a high enough altitude, then the warmed air in the pressurized cabin will feel significantly warmer than the air outside the plane. Even if the outside temperature could cause the air to \"rise\", it would not be hot air.",

        "This is a very complex question and there are many facets that need to be considered. First, the average salary of an American GI in the mid-1930s was about $400/month. This was roughly equal to the average salary in Great Britain at the time, $385/month. While the U.S. had gone through a severe economic depression, the overall standard of living in the U.S. was much higher than in Great Britain. Second, the purchasing power of the $400/month salary was greater in the U.S. because the cost of goods was much lower due to relatively low inflation. As a result, the typical American GI was able to purchase goods that were otherwise unaffordable to British citizens, including household appliances, large home appliances, automobiles, etc. Third, it is important to consider the cost of living aside, the cost of consumer goods in the U.S. was significantly lower than in Great Britain due to currency conversions. For example, purchasing the same quantity of goods in the U.S. using British Pounds would have cost about 25%, or $300, compared to the $200 paid in the U.S. Therefore, the typical American GI had 25% more purchasing power than the typical British citizen. While it is difficult to determine who would have been \"better off\" based on the given facts, it is clear that the cost of living aside, the average American GI had a much better standard of living than the average British citizen.",
        "This paper proposes encoding and decoding representations with Sum- and Max-Product networks. Instead of modeling the distribution with sampling-based methods likeMH Mealy Machine, it allows exact and efficient inference with the help of a factorized and convex parameter space. The model is proven to be an universal function approximator. When converted into Max-Product networks, it is possible to decode such representations back into the original input space. And the decoded representations can be viewed as “meaningful parts” of the original data. The learned representation also yield a large improvement when used in structured prediction tasks. Although Sum-Product networks have been successfully applied in several domains, it is for black-box distribution estimators. This makes the model difficult to be adopted by non-experts. The main contributions of this paper are: 1. SPN can be naturally employed as hierarchical feature extractor to learn unsupervised representation. 2. When SPN converted to MPN, it is possible to encode and decode representations for both exact inference and meaningful representation. 3. The learned representations can be visualized and can also yield a large improvement when used in structured prediction tasks. Based on the above contributions, SPN and MPN are strong competitors to RBM and other stacked autoencoder. rest The main contributions can be summarized as follow: 1. SPN can be naturally employed as hierarchical feature extractor to learn unsupervised representation. 2. When SPN converted to MPN, it is possible to encode and decode representations for exact inference as well as meaningful representation. 3.

        "\nWe study non-Abelian and entangled string networks by means of velocity-dependent models. Our main results are as follows. (i) For any non-Abelian group $G$ and any positive integer $n$, there exists a velocity-dependent model which generates a non-Abelian string network with $n$-branes and with the symmetry group $G$. (ii) For any positive integer $n$, there exists a velocity-dependent model which generates an entangled string network with $n$-branes. (iii) For any positive integer $n$, there exists a velocity-dependent model which generates a string network with $n$-branes and with the full symmetry group. In all three results, the velocity-dependent model has a certain special form; in particular, it always involves a certain amount of anisotropy.\n\nWe also show that any velocity-dependent model which generates a string network with $n$-branes and with the symmetry group $G$ can be obtained as the integral over $\\mathbb R^3$ of a certain linear combination of $G$-invariant harmonic functions on $\\mathbb R^3$. As an application, we show that our results imply that certain types of string networks (with $n$-branes) can be realized as semi-infinite feats of engineering.\n\nWe also discuss some open problems.",
        "We use pillows now when we sleep because when we were hunter-gatherers, our main source of food was hunting and gathering, and the main threat to our survival was becoming inactive and losing consciousness due to low oxygen levels in the environment. Packs of wolves would also eat your body after you became unconscious from lack of oxygen. So the first use of pillows was to prevent human heads from becoming a convenient meal for animals. As time passed and human beings started to settle in one place, another threat to their survival started to emerge. This time it was cold. History shows that before the Iron Age, people would pile up furs or other animals skins to create fires to warm themselves. This worked great as long as there was an unlimited amount of animals around, but once there was not, it meant people would freeze to death. The first use of pillows again was necessary to create shelters that would protect people from the cold.",

The authors propose an algorithm that is motivated by the observation that local extrema with low generalization error have a large proportion of almost-zero eigenvalues in the Hessian with very few positive or negative eigenvalues. To leverage this observation, the authors construct a local-entropy-based objective function that favors well-generalizable solutions lying in large flat regions of the energy landscape, while avoiding poorly-generalizable solutions located in the sharp valleys. The authors conceptually describe their algorithm as two nested loops of SGD where Langevin dynamics is used in the inner loop to compute the gradient of the local entropy before each update of the weights.\n\nThe paper is well-written and the proposed algorithm is clearly explained. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm and its performance, as well as a comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

You will need some sort of software program called a \"beat-mixer\" which allows you to do this.   The song you want to mix should already exist before you begin your project.    If you're using Ableton Live 8 then you'll just open up one track from each file into separate channels.     Once you've done this click on the mixer window where all three tracks appear side by side.    Then drag the first channel's volume knob down until it's almost inaudible.    Now move the second channel's volume slider right over top of the first channel's volume slider.    When you release the mouse button the audio signals will cross-fade between these two tracks creating a seamless transition between the two sounds.      Be aware though if you don't set the volumes correctly you could end up hearing only one sound instead of having both go through at once.    There are several ways to create transitions such as:    Crossfading - This creates smooth transitions between... Perform",

        "The paper \"Diverse Beam Search: Decoding Diverse Solutions from Neural Sequence Models\" deals with the problem of reducing redundancy in the outputs of neural language models by generating multiple, diverse translations of a given input. It presents a new search algorithm called Diverse Beam Search (DBS) that addresses this problem by encouraging diversity among the top beam candidates.\n\nThe paper starts by providing an overview of the related work in the field of neural machine translation and then introduces the concept of diverse beam search. It then presents a series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of DBS in reducing redundancy and improving the overall quality of generated sequences.\n\nOne of the major strengths of this paper is the clarity and comprehensiveness of the experimental setup and the results. The authors thoroughly describe the datasets and the evaluation metrics used and provide detailed analyses of the performance of DBS in comparison to other methods. The experiments show that DBS outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of various metrics, including BLEU, METEOR, and diversity scores.\n\nA weakness of this paper is that it is limited to the task of machine translation, and it would be interesting to see how the proposed method performs on other natural language processing tasks. Additionally, while the authors briefly mention the computational complexity of the DBS algorithm, it would be useful to see a more detailed analysis of the runtime costs and potential scalability issues.\n\nOverall, this paper presents an interesting and novel approach to the problem of reducing redundancy in the outputs of neural language models. The experiments provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.",
        "\n\nThe Measurement Calculus\n\nWe propose a generalization of the notion of measurement to qualitative systems. We define a qualitative measurement function as a mapping that assigns a value to every element of a qualitative system. We show that such a function can be used to define a calculus of modifications of the system, in a way analogous to the way the usual calculus of Sewcal measurements is used to define a calculus of modifications of a metric system. Our qualitative measurement calculus is a generalization of the metric measurement calculus to qualitative systems, in the same way that the qualitative ornithology is a generalization of the metric ornithology to qualitative systems.\n\nWe use the qualitative measurement calculus to define a notion of equilibrium for qualitative systems and show how to use the equilibrium definition to solve some simple qualitative games.\n\nWe also show how to use the qualitative measurement calculus to define a notion of intensity of a qualitative system and use the intensity definition to give a generalization of the idea of gravitational field to qualitative systems.\n\nFinally, we show how to use the qualitative measurement calculus to define a notion of energy of a qualitative system and use the energy definition to give a generalization of the first law of thermodynamics to qualitative systems.",

        "The Dyatlov Pass incident is a mystery stemming from the unexplained deaths of nine ski-hikers that occurred in the Ural Mountains in February, 1959. The bodies of the hikers were found in peculiar conditions, with some of them taking tremendous wounds and some even missing their tongues and eyes. The corpses were also found to contain traces of extraordinary radiation levels. Many theories have been put forth to explain the events that transpired in the Dyatlov Pass incident, ranging from the supernatural and extraterrestrial to military involvement. \n\nGiven the mysteriousness and lack of complete evidence, there is unfortunately no formal consensus in the academic community regarding the true cause of the Dyatlov Pass incident. Generally speaking, academics have proposed two divergent categories of explanations. \n\nOne camp ascribes the deaths of Dyatlov's group to the possibility of an avalanche and other natural phenomena. They argue that the hikers’ tent was cut open from the inside and that the hikers had escaped into the night, which could suggest an avalanche as the culprit.\n\nThe other camp argues that an unknown human factor was responsible for the incident; an intruder may have caused the corpses to be mutilated, brought the hikers out into the cold, or even intentionally killed them. Given that the area, being populated by military personnel, may have been sensitive information-wise and closed to civilians, the bodies may have been subjected to disposal to maintain secrecy. \n\nWhile both camps argue their respective points adamantly, neither has been able to explain the radioactive particles found on the bodies, leading some to speculate government involvement. \n\nThe lack of a formal consensus among the scientific community has fed much of the speculation surrounding the Dyatlov Pass incident. Without a full understanding of the facts and an absence of any clear-cut explanation from the government, the true cause of the Dyatlov Pass incident remains shrouded in mystery. Despite ongoing research, the incident is likely to remain a tantalizing unsolved mystery for years to come.",
        "The recent discovery that spending a year in space can change an astronaut's DNA is certainly an interesting one. Previously, we assumed that an individual's DNA was fixed, and any changes that occurred were the result of genetic mutations or exposure to harmful environmental factors. However, this discovery challenges that assumption.\n\nScientists have long known that the human body undergoes certain changes when exposed to the microgravity environment of space. For example, bone density decreases, muscle mass is lost, and the cardiovascular system adapts to the unique conditions. But the fact that these changes can affect an individual's DNA is a previously unknown phenomenon.\n\nSo what does this tell us about DNA? For starters, it suggests that DNA is not as static as we once thought. Instead, it may be more malleable than we realized, able to adapt and change in response to environmental factors. It also raises questions about the potential implications of such changes. Could astronauts experience long-term health effects as a result of alterations to their DNA?\n\nOf course, this discovery is still relatively new, and much more research is needed to fully understand its implications. But it's clear that our understanding of DNA is evolving as we continue to learn more about the human body and its interaction with the world around us.",

Abstract:\nEliza Jane Potter (born Eliza Jane Smith; May 16, 1852 – September 8, 1931) was the first woman to graduate from Harvard University in 1872 and one of its most distinguished graduates.  She is also known as \"the mother of modern American geology\"; her work on sedimentary rocks laid the foundations for much later research by William Maclennan into isotopic dating.   Her father Henry A. Potter founded the Boston Geological Survey which became part of Harvard's Department of Geology under his son-in-law Charles Darwin Cope.\nPotter graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1870 where she had studied chemistry and mathematics before transferring to Harvard.    After receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree at Harvard, she went abroad to study mineralogy and petrology during 1873–74 while working as a teacher in Paris.     In 1876, she received her Master of Science degree after writing a thesis entitled \"On Sedimentary Rocks\" that established her reputation among scientists worldwide.   The following year, she married fellow geologist Charles Darwin Coppee who would become Professor Emeritus of Geology at Harvard.       During 1877-78, they traveled together through Europe studying fossil records along the way.      They returned home to marry their respective families and begin teaching courses together at Harvard.

        "In our study, \"Cosmic M\\'enage \\`a Trois: The Origin of Satellite Galaxies On Extreme Orbits,\" we investigate the formation of satellite galaxies in massive galaxy clusters. Our motivation for this research stems from the fact that these satellites can provide significant insight into the processes of cosmic evolution and the formation of structures in the universe.\n\nUsing numerical simulations, we explore the relationship between satellite galaxies and the potential wells of their respective clusters. Our results show that the formation of satellite galaxies is strongly influenced by the gravitational interactions between the host cluster and neighboring clusters. In particular, we find that satellite galaxies on extreme orbits, such as those located far from the center of the cluster, are more likely to be the result of triple interactions between the host cluster, a nearby group, and the infalling satellite.\n\nOur methodology involves running a series of high-resolution simulations using state-of-the-art cosmological models. We analyze the resulting data to identify the evolution of satellite galaxies over time and the factors that contribute to their formation and evolution.\n\nOverall, our findings provide key insights into the origin and evolution of satellite galaxies in massive galaxy clusters and contribute to a better understanding of the larger processes of cosmic structure formation and evolution.",
        " Kurt Jara (2 May 1947 – 30 November 2015) was an Austrian football player and manager. Jara was born in Vienna. He spent his entire playing career in the Austrian league system, save for a brief spell with Royal Antwerp in Belgium. After two years with Austria Vienna he moved to the club's local rivals Rapid Wien in 1972, winning the league and cup double in his first season. He won the league again in 1975–76, but left after Rapid's defeat to Real Madrid in the following season's European Cup. After a year back at Austria Vienna he signed for Wiener Sportclub in 1978, winning the league and cup in his first season.

        "Acne is a common dermatological condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is caused by a combination of several factors, including sebum overproduction, bacteria proliferation, inflammation, and hormonal imbalances. Despite the numerous acne treatment options available, it remains a challenging condition to manage and eradicate completely. There are several reasons why acne is so hard to get rid of, and these include the complexity of the skin structure, the individual variability in acne presentation, the chronic nature of the condition, and the limited efficacy of available treatments.\n\nThe skin is a complex organ with multiple layers and functions, and acne can affect different skin layers. Therefore, identifying the root cause of acne and treating it effectively can be a daunting task. Additionally, acne varies widely in presentation, from mild, occasional breakouts to severe, nodular cysts that leave permanent scars. Thus, each acne patient requires an individualized treatment plan that targets their unique presentation, which can be challenging to achieve.\n\nFurthermore, acne is a chronic condition that may persist for years, and even with effective treatment, it can reoccur after a period of remission. Therefore, long-term management and monitoring of acne are necessary to achieve optimal outcomes. Moreover, the available treatment options for acne are not always effective for all patients. Some treatments may produce adverse effects, while others may require prolonged use to achieve results, reducing patient compliance.\n\nIn conclusion, acne is a challenging condition to manage and eradicate completely. The complex skin structure, individual variability in presentation, chronic nature, and limited efficacy of available treatments all contribute to the difficulty in eliminating acne. A comprehensive approach that addresses all the contributing factors is necessary for successful treatment outcomes. Additionally, further research into the underlying mechanisms of acne and the development of new, more effective treatments is essential to improve acne management in the future.",

We consider a generic boolean genetic network and we show that, if the logical depth of the network is larger than two, the spatial pattern exhibits quasi-oscillations of the spatial frequency. We show that this is due to a slow-down of the dynamics at the spatial boundaries, which results in the formation of standing waves. We characterize the threshold spatial frequency for which the dynamics is stable against changes in the initial conditions. If the spatial frequency is lower than this threshold, the dynamics is stable against changes in the initial conditions, and we show that the associated spatial pattern is robust to changes in the underlying boolean network. As an application, we consider the evolution of the segmental identity in the context of a small genetic network and we show that the dynamics can be stable against changes in the initial conditions, provided that the spatial frequency is lower than a threshold. We discuss the relation between the dynamics of the underlying genetic network and the resulting spatial pattern.",
        "\nWe examined the stability of isentropic viscous shock profiles at high Mach numbers by combining numerical Evans function calculations and asymptotic ODE estimates. We determined that, in the range $\\gamma \\in [1,2.5]$ and Mach numbers over $2,500$, viscous shock waves are unconditionally stable, independent of shock amplitude, with $\\gamma$-law gas dynamics. The convergence of the Evans function in the high-Mach number limit was established through a boundary-layer analysis, providing an upstream boundary condition for the pressureless (\"infinitely compressible\") gas. In comparison, low-Mach number behavior is known to be incompressible. Our study concluded and reinforced earlier works of Matsumura-Nishihara and Barker-Humpherys-Rudd-Zumbrun, which examined stability at low and intermediate Mach numbers, respectively. Further investigation of other $\\gamma$-values is possible, but hasnot been done yet.",
        "In this study, we investigate the periodic variability in the infrared excess of the young binary system UZ Tau E and propose a possible mechanism that could account for this variability. Circumbinary disks are known to exist around some binary systems, and we explore the possibility that accretion from such a disk could produce the observed periodic signal. We use data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and model the infrared excess as the sum of an accretion component and a dust component. We fit the parameters of these components to the observed data using Bayesian inference, and find that an accretion component that varies periodically with a period of approximately 39 days provides a good fit to the data. We discuss possible physical mechanisms that could produce this periodicity, including gravitational interactions with the companion star and instabilities in the circumbinary disk. Our results suggest that periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk is a viable explanation for the observed variability in UZ Tau E, and demonstrates the importance of circumbinary disks in shaping the early evolution of binary systems.",

There are different types of anxiety, such as general anxiety and social anxiety, and it can be caused by a variety of factors, such as stress, fear, and low self-esteem. Some people may experience mild anxiety, while others may have severe anxiety that can interfere with their daily lives.\n\nIf you have a friend or family member who is struggling with anxiety, there are things you can do to help. First, it's important to be understanding and supportive of the person. Let them know that you are there for them and that you will listen to them. Try to avoid saying things like \"just calm down\" or \"stop worrying.\" These comments can be dismissive and may not be helpful.\n\nInstead, try to encourage the person to talk about their feelings. This can help them to feel better and may also allow you to understand their concerns. You can also offer practical support, such as helping them to organize their day or to prioritize their tasks.\n\nIf the person's anxiety is severe or ongoing, it may be helpful to seek the assistance of a mental health professional. A therapist or counselor can provide the person with coping strategies and support them in managing their anxiety. You can offer to go with the person to their appointments or to help them find a therapist.\n\nRemember, it's important to be patient and understanding of the person's needs. Anxiety can be a difficult condition to manage, but with support and treatment, it is possible to overcome.",
        "\n\nPlaying Block Story is a great way to escape into a virtual world of adventure and excitement. Knowing how to play the game will make your time in the world more enjoyable and will also give you the upper hand on some of the enemies that you will meet on your journey. \n\nMake a New World: The first step of playing Block Story is to make a new world. This is done by clicking the \"New World\" button in the game's main menu. You will then be prompted to select a size, terrain and biome type. You can choose from presets such as Desert, Snowy Mountain and Coastal, or you can choose to make a completely custom world. After choosing your options, click the \"ok\" button and your new world will be created.\n\nMake a New Character: The next step is to make a character that you will use to explore the world. This is done by clicking the \"Create Character\" button in the game's main menu. Here you will be prompted to enter information such as your avatar's name, gender and skin color. You can also customize your characters attributes such as strength, agility and intelligence. \n\nGo Through the Introduction and Find Ted: Once you have created your world and character, you will be prompted to select a world and enter the game. You will then be taken to an introduction where you will meet Ted, an old man who will give you some tips and advice before you set off in your new world. \n\nGet Wood: The first thing you will want to do after meeting Ted is to get some wood. This can be done by searching the ground for logs and branches that you can then collect. You can also use the axe you get from Ted to chop down trees. Collect as much wood as you can, as you will need it to make tools and other items.\n\nMake Planks: Once you have some wood, you will next want to make planks with it. To do this, go to your crafting table (which you get from Ted during the introduction) and select the \"Planks\" option. This will allow you to craft planks out of the wood you have collected.\n\nTake Out the Crafting Table You Made During the Introduction and Place It: Once you have crafted your planks, you can take out the crafting table you made during the introduction and place it where you want it to be. The crafting table will be able to store various recipes and items, making it easier to craft things. \n\nMake Some Sticks: Using your crafting table, you can now make sticks. This is done by combining two pieces of wood planks together. The sticks can then be used to make other items and recipes. \n\nGet Wax: The next step is to get some wax, which can be found by searching for small hives around the map. Once you have collected the wax, you can combine it with sticks to create torches, which will be useful when exploring dark caves and underground areas. \n\nFind Some Coal: To be able to craft tools and weapons, you will next need to find some coal. This can be found by looking for the occasional black ore blocks that are scattered around the world. Mining the ore blocks will give you the coal you need.\n\nMake Fire: Once you have some coal, you can then make fire. To do this, you need to combine it with wood and sticks in your crafting table to create a torch. Once you have a torch, you can then place it where you need it, such as near a base you create or a cave you are exploring. \n\nMake Some Candles: The next step is to craft some candles. This is done by combining a stick and a piece of wax. The candles can then be placed so you can have some light with you when exploring caves and dark areas. \n\nPlace the Candle and Your Crafting Table Where You Want to Stay for as Long As You Need: Make sure to always keep a candle and crafting table with you when you explore so that you can stay in the areas you want for as long as you need. This will make it much easier for you to mine for ores and fight monsters since you will have a place to return to when you need to. \n\nThen If It's Night, Just Wait Out the Night: If you are exploring during the night, the easiest thing to do is just simply wait out the night. This will make it less dangerous since monsters become much more powerful during the night and you will want to avoid them as much as possible.\n\nWhen the Next Day Breaks, Find a Cave or Cliff: Once the next day breaks, you can then start to explore caves or cliffs. These are great spots to explore since they contain valuable ore blocks and monsters that you can fight for experience and to progress in the game.\n\nGo to Your Crafting Table and Make Some Swords: Once you have some ore blocks, you can then craft swords. To make a sword, go to your crafting table and select the \"Weapons\" option. Here you will find different types of swords such as Long Swords, Steel Swords and Iron Swords. Select the one you want and combine the required ingredients to make the sword.\n\nFind a Cave and Search it for Ores: Once you have a sword, you can then start exploring caves. These locations will usually contain ores such as gold ore, which can be used to craft powerful weapons and armor. Search the cave until you have at least 16 gold ore. \n\nMake Some Long Swords: Once you have the required ore blocks, you can then craft some long swords. This is done by combining an iron bar, two sticks, and a gold ingot.\n\nGo Back to the First Cave's Monster and Kill It: Now that you have some long swords, you can now go back to the first cave's monster and take it out. Killing the monster will give you experience and rewards you can use to progress in the game.\n\nKeep Mining, Getting Ores, and Fighting Monsters Until You Run Out of Long Swords: After killing the first monster, keep mining, getting ores, and fighting monsters until you run out of long swords. This will help you gather enough materials and experience needed for the next steps.\n\nGo Back Home and Do Ted's Quest: Once you have gathered enough materials and experience, return to your home and do Ted's quest. This will allow you to progress to the next stage of the game.\n\nGet His Next Quest: After completing Ted's quest, you will be rewarded with a new quest. This quest will usually have you searching for a particular item or area in the game. \n\nDo That Quest: Once you have received the new quest from Ted, complete it. This will usually involve traveling to a new area or fighting a certain enemy or boss. \n\nSee Paula: After completing the quest you received from Ted, you will be prompted to see Paula. She will have more quests for you to complete.\n\nDo Paula's Quests Until You Get to the One Where You Have to Kill 20 Dyllin/Werewolves: Complete the quests given by Paula until you reach the quest where you have to kill twenty Dyllin/werewolves. This quest is fairly straightforward, just make sure to have a good stock of weapons and armor.\n\nMake a Chest to Hold Some of Your Stuff: After getting all the required materials and defeating the Dyllin/werewolves, you should make a chest to hold some of your stuff. This chest can store anything you need it to, from weapons and armor to ore blocks and tools.\n\nFind Some Caves and Fight Through Monsters and Collect Ore Until You Have: Once you have your chest ready, find some caves and explore them. Inside you will find monsters and ore blocks. Defeat the monsters and collect the ore blocks until you have at least 50 blue ore, 25 ruby ore and 110 coal ore, as well as being at least level 30.\n\nGet as Much of Your Stuff as You Can, Head for a Mountain for the Werewolf Quest: After collecting enough ore and fighting enough monsters, collect as much of your stuff as you can and head for the mountain to complete the werewolf quest. Stay there for the night and then find Paula the next day to complete the quest. \n\nBy following these steps, you can play Block Story and explore and adventure in a virtual world. The more you play, the more you will learn and the better chance you will have against the enemies you will meet. Have fun and enjoy the journey!",
        "Title: Divide and Conquer with Neural Networks\n\nSummary:\n\nThe paper presents a novel approach called \"Divide and conquer with neural networks\" for improving the performance of large neural networks. The main idea of the approach is to divide the input data into multiple smaller subsets and use separate neural networks to learn from each sub-set. The output of each neural network is then combined at the end to produce the final output.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The approach is novel and innovative, and it has the potential to overcome the limitations of large neural networks by successfully reducing the complexity of the learning process.\n\n2. The results presented in the paper show that the approach achieves significant improvements in performance compared to existing methods.\n\n3. The authors have explained the approach in a clear and concise manner, and the experiments are well-designed and easy to replicate.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The authors did not provide enough analysis to explain why the \"divide and conquer\" approach works better than other techniques for large neural networks.\n\n2. The experiments were performed only on a small number of datasets, and it is unclear how well the approach would perform on other datasets.\n\n3. The authors did not compare the proposed approach with other divide and conquer strategies available in the literature.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis to explain why the \"divide and conquer\" approach works better than other techniques for large neural networks.\n\n2. The experiments should be performed on a larger number of datasets to prove the reliability and efficiency of the proposed approach in comparison with other techniques.\n\n3.

After the two men charged at each other, Montgomery's lance shattered and the splintered wood pierced the king's eye, ultimately killing him. \n\nAt the time of the accident, it was not yet known if the death was accidental or intentional and the facts of the case were heavily debated. Ultimately, it determined that Montgomery was not culpable in the death. In spite of this, as a gesture of atonement, the Comte de Montgomery voluntarily exiled himself from court and went to Geneva where he lived out the remainder of his days at a monastery.\n\nBeing a prominent member of the court, the king's death had a huge affect on those close to him and the courtian's view of jousting. As a result, the sport began to die out. It had been popular entertainment for centuries, but its associated prestige diminished and it no longer held the same allure. \n\nHenry II's death had immense implications for the French monarchy. He was the second son of Francis I and had assumed the throne when his elder brother Charles V died. This meant that Henry's death resulted in Francis II taking the throne. However, his death at the age of only 16 made him ineligible to rule due to his age— leading to his younger brother, Charles IX, taking the throne. This resulted in the period known as the Wars of Religion, a series of conflicts between Catholics and Protestants which would ravage France throughout the 1560s.\n\nNot only did the death of Henry II cause a lot of personal grief and leave a power vacuum in the French court, it inadvertently changed the course of French history. In addition to the Wars of Religion, it also amplified the crisis between Catholic and Protestant factions. This ultimately was the inception of not just a religious crisis, but it also had huge implications for French politics that would reverberate for centuries. \n\nIn the wake of Henry II's death, the court was forced to accept the new ruler, Charles IX, and move away from the jousts that had become so popular in French court. The death of Henry II not only caused a great deal of personal tragedy, it also had huge implications for the history of France.",
        "\nWe explore the behavior of a spin-polarized, magnetically-trapped mixture of $^7$Li and $^{87}$Rb atoms in the ultracold regime, measuring the thermalization velocity of the two species and quantifying the absolute value of the associated triplet s-wave scattering length. We obtain a scattering length of $|a_{7,87}|=(59\\pm19)a_{\\rm B}$ between the two atoms. We also propose an experiment designed to identify the sign of $a_{7,87}$ by studying the mixture through the condensed regime. Evaluating the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations based on the assumption of a positive sign of the scattering length, we find that phase separation of the two clouds will occur, stabilized by mean-field interactions and allowing for substantial populations of condensed $^7$Li atoms before collapse. Observation of this stabilization phenomenon would surely reveal the sign of the scattering length and therefore lead to a better understanding of the interactions between $^7$Li and $^{87}$Rb.",
        "Generally, the paper of LSTM-Based System-Call Language Model for Host-Based Intrusion Detection is a good work. It presents a novel ensemble method that blends multiple thresholding classifiers into a single one, making it possible to accumulate `highly normal' sequences. The proposed system-call language model has several advantages. First, it learns the semantic meaning and interactions of each system call that existing methods cannot effectively consider. Second, it has the ability to generalize well to unseen datasets. Third, it exhibits high portability, which is one of the key aspects of realizing successful intrusion detection systems. However, there are several issues that need to be further studied. For example, how to prove the semantic meaning and interaction of each system call? How to realize the generalization ability to unseen datasets? How to study the complexity of the model? How to study the storage and efficiency of the model? First of all, I want to thank the authors for sharing their work and making it available for review. According to my understanding, the semantic meaning and interaction of each system call will be learned by the model. In this case, how to prove it? For example, the authors use system call tcp sequence numbers to represent the connection. Could it be replaced? How to generalize to unseen datasets? For example, in the experiment of page 9, there are datasets from December 2023 to June 2024. Is it possible to study the generalization ability without these datasets? How to study the complexity and efficiency of the model? How to study the storage and efficiency of the model? For example, when the model is learned, the model size is large and there are many parameter matrices. Is it possible to study the storage and efficiency of the model from these parameters? Thanks for your suggestion. These issues will be studied in the following work. 1. How to prove the semantic meaning and interaction of each system call? 2. Generalization to unseen datasets. 3. Study the complexity and efficiency of the model. 4. Study the storage and efficiency of the model. First of all, I want to thank the authors for sharing their work and making it available for review. According to my understanding, the semantic meaning and interaction of each system call will be learned by the model. In this case, how to prove it? For example, the authors use system call tcp sequence numbers to represent the connection. Could it be replaced? There are some ways to prove the semantic meaning and interaction of each system call. For example, we can use the method of feature engineering to describe the semantic meaning of each system call and corresponding features. After the model is learned, we can check the topK important features for each system call. Alternatively, we can use the process of disease diagnosis in medicine as the model. For example, if a patient has breast cancer, the doctor will study the topK medical history of the patient and disease-related symptoms. How to generalize to unseen datasets? For example, in the experiment of page 9, there are datasets from December 2023 to June 2024. Is it possible to study the generalization ability without these datasets? It’s not easy to study the generalization ability without the seen datasets. However, we can transform the seen datasets to new forms. For example, in the seen datasets, each line represents one system call being sent between a client and a server. The time (line) is the execution time of a certain system call. So, we can study the generalization ability of a model from the change of times. By increasing the length of the time range, we can study the generalization ability of the model from a broader range. How to study the complexity and efficiency of the model? The complexity and efficiency of the model can be reflected in three aspects. Firstly, the complexity of the model reflects the number of neural networks in the model. Secondly, the complexity of the training model represents the number of epochs to train the model. And the efficiency of the model represents the training time. Thirdly, the efficiency of the model represents the parameters’ size. The model has a reasonable number of parameters. So, the training time is reasonable. As for the training efficiency, the model can be divided into three parts, including embedding layer, sequential LSTM and fully connected layer. So, we can learn the efficiency of each part. Finally, the model is basically a CondenseNet model. The structure of a CondenseNet is an encoder-decoder architecture with a lateral connection. In general, the encoder part can decrease the length of inputs to improve the efficiency and capacity of the model. At the same time, the decoder part can recover the outputs according to the input lengths. In the model, the encoder part is the embedded layer, and the size of the encoded",

        "This is an excellent paper! I particularly like the introduction of a new method that combines Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes with Deep Learning, which allows the authors to handle nonlinear, high-dimensional data such as images and sequences, without requiring prior domain knowledge. The authors show that by enabling backpropagation through transitions, the model is able to encode state space assumptions and realistic long-term predictions. This is a compelling addition to the large body of work on statistical state space models. I have only a few suggestions for the paper: 1) The introduction briefly mentions 2 existing methods that use Variational Inference to learn state space models, but does not provide much detail about how these methods fail in comparison with DVBF. It would be helpful to have a larger discussion of these failures, and how the proposed method addresses them. 2) In the general discussion, it would be helpful to summarize the assumptions underlying VIM Walks and State Space models. (E.g. that the states evolve Markovianly). It would also be helpful to compare the assumptions and limitations of these models. 3) In the experiments, it would be interesting to see some comparisons to both SSMs and VIM Walks. It would be good to show that DVBF is able to produce meaningful results on some test cases that are hard to model with SSMs or VIM-SSMs. For example, it would be interesting to see this model trained on raw financial data (e.g. stock prices) to show that it could be used to predict not only short-term but also longer-term movement. That being said, I really enjoyed reading this paper, and the use of Variational Inference to solve the challenging problems posed by nonlinear, high-dimensional data. This is an important area of research, and this paper contributes to it in an excellent way.",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Ongoing Galactic Accretion: Simulations and Observations of Condensed Gas in Hot Halos\".\nAbstract:\nWe present new simulations that show how condensed gas is formed by ongoing accretion onto galactic halos, which are heated to temperatures above 10 million degrees Kelvin (MK). The condensed gas forms as the hot halo cools radiatively on timescales shorter than its dynamical time. We compare these results with observations of cool clouds in nearby galaxy clusters. Our models predict that condensed gas should be found at distances between 100 kpc and 1 Mpc from galaxies within massive clusters. This prediction agrees well with recent X-ray observations of cool clouds in Abell 1795 and Abell 2163. These clouds have masses ranging from $10^{9}$ to $10^{11}$ solar masses, sizes less than 50 kiloparsecs, and densities greater than 1000 atoms per cubic centimeter. They also appear to be moving outward relative to their host galaxies at velocities up to several hundred kilometers per second. In addition, we find that our model predicts cloud lifetimes longer than one billion years for most observed clouds.",
        "Cruising is a term commonly used in the United States to refer to the act of driving around in a car for leisure, pleasure or to show off. This activity has its roots in the 1950s when teenage culture started gaining popularity in the country. Since then, cruising has become a widespread phenomenon in many parts of America, particularly in suburban areas. The activity of cruising typically involves driving slowly around a predetermined circular route, or a cruising loop, usually in a downtown or suburban area. The loop may be chosen depending on the availability of facilities such as parking lots, restaurants, shopping centers and other points of interest. Cruisers usually drive around in their personal cars or motorcycles, stop, chat and display their cars to onlookers. Cruising has been associated with the development of a car culture since the 1950s, particularly among young people. It is a form of socializing and a way to connect with others with whom one shares common interests, in this case, cars. In addition to socializing, cruising has also been viewed as a way of self-expression, particularly among young people in search of identity. In some cases, cruising has become a cause of concern for local authorities due to traffic congestion and noise pollution. Consequently, some cities have enforced regulations to control or prohibit the activity, or created designated areas for cruising. Nevertheless, many still participate in the activity, and it remains a popular pastime in the United States. In conclusion, cruising is an American multidimensional activity that has influenced popular culture, music, fashion, and advertising. It is an activity that continues to be celebrated in various communities across the United States, although it has also been the subject of scrutiny. Cruising remains a significant part of popular culture and will continue to evolve and influence the younger generation of drivers in the country.",

        "Planes follow a pretty complex trajectory in the sky. To fly from one place to another, an airplane starts by taking off from a airport. This takes off in a pretty straight line, or direction, towards the sky. As the airplane moves through the sky, it might need to fly over cities, lakes, or mountains. To avoid these obstacles, the airplane will make a turn so that it is flying along a new direction, called the flight direction. The new direction is a combination of the original direction the airplane was headed and the direction of the turn. Flying along a straight line requires the airplane to keep track of two direction. The direction it is heading and the direction of the turn. If the plane only tracked the direction it is heading, the plane would fly in a loop. To keep flying in a straight line, the plane also needs to adjust the turn so that it is perpendicular to the direction the plane is heading. Flying perpendicular to the direction of the turn requires a complicated set of calculations. When flying towards a destination, planes will often take huge detours around cities or mountains. If a plane is flying from a airport in Boston to a resort in Vermont, it might take a detour over New York City. These detours are the result of the plane’s trajectory having to avoid cities, lakes, or mountains.",

        "\n\nInstalling a brick driveway is a labor intensive job, but the end result is a driveway that's strong and beautiful. Properly installing a brick driveway requires planning and patience, but if done correctly it can be an asset to any property.\n\nStep 1: Lay out the driveway in the shape you want it. Use a long straight edge and a string line and/or a couple of stakes and string to mark the shape of the driveway. Make sure the driveway is a minimum of 12 to 14 feet wide. Start at the center of the drive, then work out towards the edges.\n\nStep 2: Excavate the area for the driveway to a depth of at least 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm). After the area has been graded, traffic compact the raw sub-grade. This helps to minimize the settling of the driveway.\n\nStep 3: Bring in the stone base that will double as support for the brick drive and as drainage. The stone should be dumped in small manageable piles on the sub-grade.\n\nStep 4: Install the stone in at least 2 or, better, 3 lifts using a plate vibrator to compact it together. The last lift of stone should be held to a grade that allows for 2 inches (5.1 cm) of sand and the 3 inch (7.6 cm) paver depth.\n\nStep 5: Cover the stone with landscape cloth to stop weeds from coming up between the pavers. Place 2 inches (5.1 cm) of sand over the cloth to bed the paver block in.\n\nStep 6: Set the plastic brick edge retainer in place following manufacturer's instructions. This will keep the brick from moving and shifting.\n\nStep 7: Begin at the center of the end of the driveway and work out toward the edges using brick spacers to keep even spacing. Use a 3 foot (1 m) length of 2x4 inch (5.1 x 10.2 cm) wood to lay across the bricks every couple of feet. Start on the second row, centering the brick over the joint of the two bricks in the middle. Continue the previous 3 steps to the completion of the driveway.\n\nStep 8: Use masonry sand to fill the joints between the brick by spreading it out over the brick and sweeping it into the joints. Make sure the sand is well worked into the joint.\n\nStep 9: Spray water from a hose over the brick to settle the sand into the joints. If necessary, you can wet the sand ahead of time and let it sit to soften the sand for tamping into the joint.\n\nOnce you have finished the installation of your brick driveway, you can add sealant for an added level of protection. The sealant helps prevent weed growth between the brick, as well as prevent oil and other automotive fluids from damaging the driveway. With proper maintenance, your brick driveway can last for many years.",

        "\nResearchers are eager to confirm direct WIMP dark matter particle detections from the galactic halo as scientific proof of their existence, and a step towards this is the use of a direction-sensitive detector. This experiment can measure the velocity anisotropy of the halo, denoted as 'beta', which, according to cosmological N-body simulations, is nonzero for dark matter, but zero for baryonic matter. Through Monte Carlo analysis, it has been concluded that detecting more than 10^4 WIMP events with nuclear recoil energies of 100 keV or more in a 32S target, leading to a precision of around 0.03, can increase the chances of improving the sensitivity greatly. Backgrounds and other potential factors have been considered during the study, and the findings have shown that a direction-sensitive detector is a resilient way of distinguishing between dark matter and baryonic matter.",
        " A Fool Who'll is a solo rock project created by American musician and singer-songwriter Toby Snell in 2008. The project has produced two full-length albums and two EPs, as well as several singles, distributed through various online outlets. Snell formed A Fool Who'll in 2008 with the intent of creating music that blended aspects of punk, rock, and contemporary Christian music (CCM). His first release, the eight-song self-titled full-length album, was released in 2009 on Stable Ground Records. The album won praise from critics, who described it as \"rich and gritty\", and \"intelligent, heartfelt songs\". After leaving Stable Ground, Snell released the EP Brave, Strange Design on the independent label Still Hear the Music. The three-song EP featured the title track, which was an alternate version of the song from the self-titled album. The follow-up full-length album Heavy is the Crown was released in 2011. The album was again very well-received by critics and was praised for its \"crunchy, loud rock and roll\" as well as its \"lyrics with plenty of thought, insight, and emotion.\" In 2014, A Fool Who'll released their fourth release and second EP, Alive in a Frozen Time. While the music maintained the crunchy, loud rock and roll sound of Heavy is the Crown, the album was praised for its thoughtful, introspective lyrics and more musical experimentation. The project has received acclaim from critics and fans alike and was featured in a 2010 edition of the Alternative Press magazine. Snell continues to perform as A Fool Who'll today, playing concerts throughout the United States as well as releasing additional music. He is currently working on his third full-length album and the release is slated for 2016.",
        "\nThis paper addresses the problem of approximating the solution to a partial differential equation (PDE) using neural networks. The authors propose a recursive regression method that uses neural networks to approximate the solution to the Heat Equation with a nonlinear boundary condition, also known as the Heat-Jalabert-Guibalt PDE.\n\nStrengths:\nThe paper presents a novel approach to solving PDEs using neural networks. The recursive regression method is well-motivated and well-explained. The results are promising, showing that the proposed method can produce accurate approximations to the PDE solution.\n\nWeaknesses:\nThere are a few minor issues that could be improved. First, the paper could benefit from a more thorough literature review. Second, the authors should consider including a more detailed comparison of their method to other approaches for solving PDEs with neural networks. Finally, the paper could be more clear about the specific implementation details and trade-offs involved in using the recursive regression method.",
        "The paper \"Improving Policy Gradient by Exploring Under-appreciated Rewards\" presents a novel approach to improve exploration properties for model-free reinforcement learning (RL) through a more directed exploration strategy. The authors argue that the current entropy regularization to encourage undirected exploration of the reward landscape is ineffective in high dimensional spaces with sparse rewards. Therefore, they propose a technique that promotes the exploration of under-appreciated reward regions, i.e., action sequences whose log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its resulting reward.\n\nThe authors demonstrate that their proposed technique of exploring under-appreciated rewards is easy to implement, requiring only slight modifications to the standard REINFORCE algorithm. They also evaluate their approach on a set of algorithmic tasks to demonstrate that it reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity compared to baseline techniques while showing significant improvements. Importantly, their approach can solve a benchmark multi-digit addition task, which is a challenging task in RL. \n\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear and concise introduction to the proposed technique. The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison to existing techniques, and the experimental results showcase the benefits of their approach. The addition of the benchmark multi-digit addition task is an impressive contribution to the field of RL. \n\nHowever, there are a few limitations and areas for improvement. First, the authors only tested the proposed technique on algorithmic tasks and did not showcase the technique's application to real-world problems. Second, the technique depended on the performance of the given baseline and could lead to a significant reduction in performance if the baseline was inferior. Lastly, a more in-depth analysis of the technique, such as a complexity analysis, could be interesting.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed technique presented in this paper provides a promising approach to improve exploration properties in model-free RL, and the authors provide rigorous evidence of its effectiveness. The paper's contribution is significant, and it is well-suited for publication in a top-tier RL conference.",
        "Yes, insomnia has been observed in animals other than humans. The most common animal that suffers from insomnia is the domestic dog. This similarity between humans and dogs will not come as a surprise to those of us familiar with the potential of the canine-human bond.\n\nInsomnia in canines is a common occurrence, due to a variety of factors. Cognitive decline is one factor, leading to increased restlessness and vigilance during sleep. High levels of stress and anxiety can also lead to poor sleep in dogs, manifested as restlessness and a lack of continuity in the sleep-wake cycle. \n\nOther factors such as temperature changes, changes in environment, and a dangerous internal environment or environment that is not conducive to finding or being safe can cause insomnia in a dog.\n\nAnimals that sleep in the wild can also suffer from bouts of insomnia. This can happen when the animal is exposed to an unfamiliar environment, or when the animal is faced with a large predator in the vicinity. This would result in a change in the timings of rest and sleep, with the animal being hyper-vigilant and apporaching sleep with caution. \n\nIn short, it appears that insomnia is a common occurrence in a variety of species, both domesticated and wild. The causes can be varied and complex, but it appears that animals seem to suffer from the intermittent and disrupted sleep similar to humans.",
        "Cheesecake is a beloved dessert that is perfect for any occasion. Whether you want to make a classic vanilla cheesecake or something more unique like a candy bar cheesecake, the process can seem daunting. However, with the right ingredients and technique, making a cheesecake can be a fun and easy experience. Here's how to make a cheesecake that will have everyone asking for seconds.\n\nPart 1: Making the Classic Vanilla Cheesecake\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius). \n\n2. Crush the graham crackers by placing them in a ziplock bag and crushing them with a rolling pin or food processor until finely ground.\n\n3. Mix the crumbs with the other crust ingredients, which typically includes sugar and melted butter, until well combined.\n\n4. Pack your crust into the springform pan by pressing the mixture evenly into the bottom and up the sides of the pan.\n\n5. Bake for 10 minutes to set the crust, then remove from the oven and allow to cool.\n\n6. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius).\n\n7. Beat the cream cheese until it is smooth using an electric mixer or food processor.\n\n8. Add the sugar, salt, vanilla, and eggs one at a time, mixing after each addition until well combined.\n\n9. Slowly add the sour cream and heavy cream, continuing to mix until the batter is smooth and creamy.\n\n10. Pour the filling into the springform pan, being careful not to overfill the pan.\n\n11. Place the springform pan into a roasting pan filled with about 1 inch of hot water, then bake for 1 1/2 hours.\n\n12. Cool the cheesecake in the oven for 1 hour with the oven door slightly ajar.\n\n13. After an hour, remove the cheesecake from the oven and allow it to cool completely before refrigerating for at least 4 hours.\n\nPart 2: Making Variations of the Classic Cheesecake\n\n1. Beat the cream cheese until smooth, then add condensed milk, lemon juice, and vanilla to make a deliciously tangy lemon cheesecake. Pour the filling into the cooled crust, then refrigerate until firm.\n\n2. Make mini cheesecakes by dividing the crust and filling mixture into a muffin tin. This is perfect for parties or when you want to offer a variety of flavors.\n\n3. Bake a chocolate cheesecake by adding cocoa powder to the filling mixture, then topping it with chocolate chips or ganache.\n\n4. Prepare a caramel cheesecake by adding caramel sauce to the filling mixture, then drizzling additional caramel sauce over the baked cheesecake.\n\n5. Create a fancy yet simple raspberry swirl cheesecake by adding raspberry jam or puree to the filling mixture, then swirling it with a knife for a marbled effect.\n\n6. Celebrate all things sweet with a candy bar cheesecake by adding chopped candy bars to the crust or topping the cheesecake with candy, whipped cream, and caramel sauce.\n\n7. Try a vegan cheesecake by using vegan cream cheese and substituting the eggs for flax eggs or tofu. This is a great option for those with dietary restrictions.\n\n8. Try something new with a goat cheese cheesecake by using goat cheese instead of cream cheese and adding herbs like basil or thyme.\n\n9. Finish a special meal with a seasonal cheesecake by adding seasonal fruit like pumpkin or apple to the filling mixture.",

        "Write a long abstract of a scientific paper from arXiv.org. Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Angular momentum conservation and torsional oscillations in the Sun and solar-like stars\".\nAbstract:\nWe present an analysis of helioseismic data for the angular velocity profile of the Sun, which is based on the assumption that the total angular momentum of the Sun is conserved during its evolution. We find that this hypothesis leads to a good agreement between theoretical predictions and observations at all latitudes except near the poles where we observe significant deviations. The discrepancies are explained by taking into account the effects of torsional oscillations in the convective envelope of the Sun. Our results show that these oscillations can be excited by internal magnetic fields generated by differential rotation in the radiative interior of the Sun. This mechanism may also operate in other solar-type stars with strong surface magnetic activity. In our study we use high-precision measurements of the frequency splitting of acoustic modes obtained using space-based instruments (GOLF and MDI) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite. \n \n Keywords: Angular momentum, Torsional oscillations",
        "Soak your toes in a very-warm to hot mixture of 1/4 cup (60cc) of Epsom salts granules added into a pint (1/2 liter) of full strength white vinegar or double all ingredients if desired.

The above instruction on how to cure toenail fungus inexpensively and quickly describes a method which has worked well for me, over many years. I was first made aware of this fungus-fighting method from a previous relationship many years ago, so I have had the technique \"saved\" (for many years, without documentation) in my subconscious mind/memory; I try to apply it whenever possible (when my feet and/or toes are showing signs of existing or future fungal infection).

This is one of many inexpensive and relatively quick methods to cure toenail fungus, without medications or chemical treatments; I have found that this (or a similar) mixture, of Epsom salts and white vinegar (or a similar sour acidic substance), has been effective to keep my toenails fungus-free, over many years. Note: my toenails are located on both my big toe and on both of my smaller toes (I have on the second and fifth toes); my feet and/or toes are fungus-prone areas, for many reasons. It may seem strange to soak your feet and/or toes in a mixture of Epsom salts and white vinegar; but it does actually have antifungal properties (as well as cleaning and disinfectant properties). This is because Epsom salts (MgSO4.7H2O) have a high solubility product, which gives them a strong ability to chelate (or bond with) the positively-charged ions (such as Ca2+, Fe2+ and Sr2+) found in foot fungus and toenail fungus; this exchange of ions (bonding/chelation) weakens the (negative charge-based) bond(s) between fungus cells and/or",

        "\nThe outcomes of our exploitation of fossil fuel reserves is not only uncertain, but highly flexible and dependent on our own choices - particularly those involving unconventional fossil fuels found in extreme or pristine environments, and those of 'peak oil'. In light of estimates from the Energy Information Administration, and recent trends towards lower estimations, there is a possibility to limit atmospheric CO2 emissions to roughly 450 ppm by 2100 by constraining coal, unconventional fossil fuels, and land use. To achieve this, coal-fired power plants must be phased out before mid-century, and there must be a focus on conserving and 'stretching' conventional oil reserves, as well as developing clean technologies for 'beyond fossil fuels'. Ultimately, a rising price on carbon emissions may be the most effective strategy to discourage conversion of fossil losses into usable reserves and keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling.",

Malrotation with visceral heterotopia is a rare congenital anomaly that is present at birth. The heterotopia may be found in the omentum, the jejunum, the ileum, the colon, the mesenterium, the mediastinum or even within the same hernial sac. Its origin is the abnormal rotation of the intestines during the 5th week of fetal development. The frequency of heterotopia increases with the distance from the caecum. Abnormalities in intestinal transit or in peristalsis may cause vomiting and, in extreme cases, intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis is suspected on plain X-ray examination of the abdomen when intestinal malrotation is associated with an abnormal position of the caecum and colon or with multiple air-filled intestinal loops in the abdominal cavity. Diagnosis is confirmed during surgery when the pathological intestinal segment or segments are found, with or without an associated malrotation. We report the case of a 16 year old patient with recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting. Abdominal ultrasound and barium enema examination revealed malrotation with intestinal intussusception secondary to malrotation and visceral heterotopia in the ileum.<|endoftext|>import pytest from snuba.query_language.parser import parser_builder from snuba.query_language import parser as query_parser @pytest.fixture(scope=\"function\") def parser_builder_fixture(request): parser_builder.clear() yield parser_builder.build_parser() def test_parser_builder_fixture_built_parser_returns_correctly( parser_builder_fixture ): assert parser_builder_fixture.built_parser is not None def test_parser_builder_fixture_built_parser_returns_correctly_when_none_is_passed( parser_builder_fixture ): with pytest.raises(TypeError): parser_builder_fixture.built_parser = None <|endoftext|>The federal government’s bailout of the auto industry is starting to look a lot like the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that was enacted during the last economic downturn.

        "\nThis paper addresses the problem of unsupervised video frame prediction. Its main strength is its simplicity, while its main weakness is that it is less sophisticated than other approaches.\n\nThis paper proposes a simple unsupervised approach for next frame prediction in video. Instead of directly predicting the pixels in a frame given past frames, the paper predicts the transformations needed for generating the next frame in a sequence, given the transformations of the past frames. This leads to sharper results, while using a smaller prediction model. In order to enable a fair comparison between different video frame prediction models, the paper also proposes a new evaluation protocol. The paper uses generated frames as input to a classifier trained with ground truth sequences. This criterion guarantees that models scoring high are those producing sequences which preserve discriminative features, as opposed to merely penalizing any deviation, plausible or not, from the ground truth. The paper's proposed approach compares favorably against more sophisticated ones on the UCF-101 data set, while also being more efficient in terms of the number of parameters and computational cost.",

        "The miniseries ‘The Pacific’ seeks to draw an accurate picture of the events taking place during World War Two in the Pacific theatre. The show centers on the lives of three US soldiers, Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie and John Basilone, detailing their wartime experiences and the political, ethical and psychological put into context. \n\nIt is therefore reasonable to ask whether the show’s depiction of Japanese military atrocities in Okinawa is factually accurate. In short, the answer appears to be ‘yes’. \n\nThroughout the war, the Japanese military, under orders from the Emperor at the time Hirohito, carried out a number of atrocities in their attempts to suppress and gain control over the people of Okinawa. This included the execution of civilians, raids on villages, raping and pillaging of homes and businesses, and forcing Okinawan women to serve as human shields and even suicide bombers known as ‘kamikazes’. \n\nEvidence for this is overwhelming. Reports and interviews with surviving American, British and Commonwealth forces provide detailed accounts of the horrific war crimes they witnessed in Okinawa. Survivors of the war paint a bleak picture of the atrocities they endured, including multiple accounts of indiscriminate shootings of civilians, and the mass killing of men women and children in order to pacify the island. \n\nArchitectural devastation also speaks to the wanton destruction perpetuated by the Japanese. Hundreds of dwellings, businesses, and government buildings were destroyed by fire and bomb blasts, a great deal more than what American forces were responsible for in the campaign. \n\nIn addition, first-hand observations by American military personnel recorded in classified documents confirm further the grim reality of events in Okinawa. Many of these documents, released after the war and declassified by the US government, provide disturbing details about the activities of the Japanese military and the devastating consequences for civilians. \n\nFinally, from the Japanese perspective, abundant records testify to the atrocities committed by their own military forces, including a now infamous series of official documents carried out in 1945 by a joint army and naval commission led by Lieutenant General Jo Iimura which investigated war crimes perpetrated in Okinawa.\n\nIn summary, the show’s depiction of Japanese military atrocities in Okinawa appears to be accurate. As is evidenced by the numerous reports and accounts of the war, the unleashed savagery of the Japanese military was devastating to both civilians and combatants alike.",
        " Olmito is a city in Cameron County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,356 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Brownsville–Harlingen Metropolitan Statistical Area. In the early 19th century, settlers began farming the area. The town was officially founded in 1858 by the Olmito Land and Cattle Company, and was named after the nearby Olmitos Plain. The town grew steadily but suffered a setback in 1886 when a fire destroyed nearly all the buildings. The town was quickly rebuilt, and a new, larger schoolhouse was built in 1912. The economy of Olmito was based mostly on farming and ranching throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The area became a popular destination for duck hunters in the 1930s, and duck hunting remains an important part of the local economy today. The town incorporated in 1989 in response to rapid growth in the area due to its close proximity to Brownsville. The population has continued to grow in recent years, reaching 3,058 by the time of the 2010 census. Olmito is served by the Brownsville Independent School District. Olmito has a post office, and its zip code is 78575. The town is home to a public library and park, as well as a number of small businesses, including a restaurant and several convenience stores. Olmito is surrounded by a number of historic sites, including the Santa Anna Ranch and El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail. The town is also the starting point for trips to several state parks and wildlife refuges in the area, including Boca Chica State Park and Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge.

        "Yellow is one of the primary colors when it comes to paints and pigments, because it can be created with a mix of equal portions of certain other colors. For example, a bright, vibrant yellow can be made using equal parts of red and green paint. This combination forms a pure, intense primary color without any secondary enhancing colors—which is what you want when painting a picture or creating a pigment.\n\nOn the other hand, when considering light, things get a bit more complicated. In basic terms, different colors of light are made up of varying combinations of three separate colors: red, green and blue. Scientists refer to these as the additive primary colors of light because when you combine these three colors in various ways you can create a stunning variety of different colors. Now here comes the tricky part: instead of a pure yellow light, what you're actually doing when you mix red, green and blue light is creating a kind of mixed yellow referred to as green-yellow. This mix is composed primarily of green light, with a small addition of red that gives it the yellowish tint. In this case the additive combination of red, green and blue is what you need to make a yellow light, it isn't a true yellow but a green-yellow because it's primarily composed of green light.\n\nIn conclusion, primary colors are important in both light and pigments, however the relevant colors can be different in each case. Pigments and paints use a mix of red, green and blue as primaries, while light as a mix of red, green and blue as its primary colors. This means yellow is an important primary when you create a pigment, however it isn't one of the primary colors when creating light: instead, you use a combination of the other colors to create a green-yellow.",
        "Bread and butter pickles are a delicious way to enjoy the crunch of cucumbers with a tangy, sweet flavor. Making them at home is a fun and rewarding kitchen project that can result in jars of pickles to last your family all winter. Here's how to make bread and butter pickles.\n\nPart 1: Preparing the Pickling Cucumbers\n\n1. Obtain pickling cucumbers. Look for cucumbers labeled as \"pickling cucumbers\" or \"Kirby cucumbers\" at your local farmers market or grocery store. These cucumbers are smaller and more flavorful than the common salad cucumbers.\n\n2. Wash the cucumbers thoroughly and slice them thickly. Use a sharp chef's knife to slice the cucumbers about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick.\n\n3. Slice the onions. Peel and slice one or two onions into thin rings to add flavor to your pickles.\n\n4. Prepare brine for the first soak. Dissolve 1/2 cup of salt for every 4 quarts of water in a large container. Put the sliced cucumbers and onions in the brine, making sure they are completely submerged. Cover the container and allow the vegetables to soak for at least 2 hours, or overnight.\n\n5. Drain the salt water out of the onion and cucumber mixture and discard it. Rinse the vegetables well with cold water and set them aside.\n\nPart 2: Preparing and Canning the Pickling Liquid\n\n1. Prepare the pickling liquid. In a large saucepan, combine 5 cups of apple cider vinegar, 3 cups of sugar, 1 tablespoon of mustard seeds, 1 tablespoon of celery seeds, and 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 10 minutes.\n\n2. Prepare the seals. While your pickling liquid is simmering, sterilize at least a dozen canning jars by boiling them in water for 10 minutes. When the jars are sterilized, remove them from the boiling water and place them on a clean towel to dry. Boil the lids and rings separately for 10 minutes.\n\n3. Pack the cucumbers and onions into the sterilized jars. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the vegetables from the brine to the jars, packing them in tightly.\n\n4. Remove any air bubbles from within the jar using a knife. Insert a long, slender plastic knife down the sides of the jar to release any air bubbles.\n\n5. Wipe the jar rim with a damp, clean cloth to remove any residue. This will help ensure a good seal.\n\n6. Place the filled jars in a water-bath canner or a large stock pot. Use a rack to prevent the jars from touching the bottom of the pot.\n\n7. Bring the canner full of water and jars to a boil and boil for 15 minutes. Add more time if you are at high altitude.\n\n8. Remove the jars from the boiling water and place them on an old towel in a sheltered area to cool overnight. Notice that if the jars are sticky, wait until they have cooled completely, at least 24 hours.\n\nCongratulations! You've made your own delicious bread and butter pickles. Store the jars in a cool, dark place for up to a year.",
        "The quantum vacuum is a magical place where particles pop in and out of existence in a probabilistic fashion. The behavior of such quantum fields underlie all known interactions. In particular, their exchange leads to the stability of the Standard Model (SM) electric charge, the spin of the particles, and the form of the interactions. If we extrapolate the particle spectrum of the SM to the lowest possible energies, we expect the particle exchanges to involve gravitons, which could explain the observed gravity, and, possibly, also photons and fermions. In this work, we discuss the first option. Gravitons are the expected carrier of the gravitational interaction, which otherwise feels indirect through intermediate messengers. Photons and fermions are the two most massive particles in the SM. Therefore, it seems plausible that they could be the corresponding force carriers. However, the fact that they are spin-1/2 fermions rather than spin-2 bosons has so far prevented them from being observed. In this work, we propose a way for photons and fermions to interact directly, through a new Lorentz- and CPT-violating term in the Standard Model Lagrangian. We present a way to test this proposal in current and future colliders. Gravitons carry both the gravitational and Lorentz-violation interactions, leading to a unique signature of completely missing particles, with two corresponding jets emerging at high invariant mass. Photons and fermions only carry the gravitational interaction. Therefore, their phenomenological implications are different. Photons and fermions can decay to gravitons, so the signature would be two jets plus missing energy. If the graviton is the lightest of the new particles, the signature would instead be four jets. An excess of any of these signatures would be a hint of the underlying theory, which could also give an explanation for dark matter and the strong and weak forces.",
        "Problem: Deep feedforward and recurrent networks have achieved impressive results in many perception and language processing applications. Recently, more complex architectures such as Neural Turing Machines and Memory Networks have been proposed for tasks including question answering and general computation, creating a new set of optimization challenges. Strength: This paper explores the low-overhead and easy-to-implement optimization technique of adding annealed Gaussian noise to the gradient, which we find surprisingly effective when training these very deep architectures. Weakness: Like other techniques for model robustness, gradient noise injection also can result in lower training loss. We see consistent improvements in performance across an array of complex models, including state-of-the-art deep networks for question answering and algorithm learning. Overall, this paper demonstrates that using gradient noise injection is an easy, effective, and low-overhead method to improve the training of very deep networks. We encourage further application of this technique to additional modern neural architectures. Here is the main content of the paper: Adding Gaussian noise to the gradient has been shown to help with optimization, with lower overhead and easy implementation. We find that this approach is highly effective when training very deep networks, a good example of which is the recently introduced Neural Turing Machine (NTM). Unlike classical weight noise, gradient noise injection is complementary to advanced stochastic optimization algorithms such as Adam and AdaGrad. The technique not only helps to avoid overfitting, but also can result in lower training loss. We observe that this optimization strategy allows a fully-connected 20-layer deep network to escape a bad initialization with standard stochastic gradient descent. We encourage further application of this technique to additional modern neural architectures.",
        "A sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope is used to examine the connection between the strength of fine structure line ratios and the strength of extinction by the torus, as measured by optical spectroscopy. The spectra are modeled with a combination of a power-law pluselines and multiple Gaussians to fit the prominent AGN narrow lines. The models are applied to a subset of the data consisting of six AGNs with a range of extinction from none to high, and corresponding to 14 spectra in total. The line ratios [SiIV+OIV]/[HeII+H]+ and [HeII]/[OIV]+ are found to increase monotonically with the amount of extinction, consistent with previous work. The /[HeII+H]+ ratio also increases with extinction, but this relationship is only significant at the 95% level. The other two line ratios, [NeV]/[HeII+H]+ and [NeV]/[OIV]+, are not found to vary with extinction. However, a subsample of four spectra with the highest extinction shows an increase in [NeV]/[HeII+H]+, from $\\approx$ 0.5 to $\\approx$ 1.4, while the other three higher-extinction spectra have [NeV]/[HeII+H]+ = [NeV]/[OIV]+. The elevated [NeV]/[HeII+H]+ in these four spectra is consistent with gas with a hard radiation field, possibly due to obscuration by a warped torus surface.",
        "\n\nHow to Throw Wiffle Ball Pitches \nDo you want to become a pitching ace in a game of wiffle ball? Pitching in wiffle ball can be done easily by following these simple steps. With just a few practice sessions, anyone can achieve the pitches of a professional.\n \nDo the Screwball. The screwball is a pitch that breaks in a corkscrew motion away from the batter after it is thrown. To achieve this spin, hold the ball with the holes in the left side and your index and middle finger on the bottom and the thumb on the top. Then rotate your wrist outwardly until your palm is facing forward with the thumb being hidden. Move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward, releasing the ball. This motion creates backspin on the ball that causes the pitch to break away from the batter.\n\nPerform the Rising Screwball. To perform the rising screwball, hold the ball similarly to the screwball with the holes to the left side and the solid side facing right. Again, rotate your wrist outward and move your arm in a three-quarter circle. This time, however, snap your wrist and arm in an upward motion as you release the ball. This gives the ball top spin and will cause it to rise over the strike zone.\n\nDo the Super Rising Screwball With Mega Death Of Doom. If you are aiming for something truly spectacular, combine the spin of the screwball with the power of an ultra spin. To perform the Super Rising Screwball With Mega Death Of Doom, hold the ball as you would for the rising screwball with the holes to the left and the solid side to the right. Rotate your wrist outwards until your palm is facing forward and your thumb is hidden. Move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward, applying a large amount of pressure on the pitch. The large spin on the ball combined with the upwards force should give the ball the maximum amount of spin.\n\nDo the Screwball For Lefties. To perform a left-handed screwball, the grip and release of the pitch is almost identical to the right-handed version. The one difference is that you will need to reverse the grip on the ball by putting the holes to the right side with the solid side to the left.\n\nCombine a Screwball/Sinker. To combine a screwball and a sinker, slightly change your grip on the ball by curling your index and middle fingers at the top of the ball and your ring and pinkie fingers at the bottom. Then move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward, releasing the ball with a twist of the wrist at the end. The combination of a sinker with a screwball gives the pitch an extra break as it approaches the plate.\n\nNasty Dropping Screwball. Combine the spin of a screwball and the force of gravity to create a deadly pitch. For this pitch, hold the ball like a screwball with the holes to the left side and the solid side to the right. But instead of rotating your wrist outwards as you normally would, twist your wrist so that the palm of your hand is facing downward and the thumb is hidden. Then, move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward downward. This will create a pitch that will drop rapidly as it approaches the batter. \n\nSick Rising Screwball: For righties, hold like a slider with the holes to the right and the solid side to the left. Twist your wrist outward so that the thumb is hidden and your palm is facing forward. Move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward, adding a slight upwards push to the pitch.\n\nDo a Slider. To perform a slider pitch, hold the ball like a screwball with the holes to the right side and the solid side to the left. Twist your wrist until the thumb is hidden and your palm is facing forward. Move your arm in a half circle and snap your wrist and arm forward, adding a slight sideways spin to the pitch.\n\nThrow a Super Slider. To give the slider an extra kick, slice your wrist and arm outward after you release the pitch. This will give the slider an extra bite and cause it to break more than usual.\n\nPerform a Better Slider. To give your slider an even bigger bite, move your arm in an unusual way. Instead of a straight three-quarter or half circle, arch your arm so that your arm ends up in a diagonal line from your shoulder to your fingertips. As you release the pitch, twist your wrist and add a sharp downwards motion.\n\nDo a Screwball/Slider. To perform a combo pitch, move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward with a twist of the wrist at the end. This will cause the pitch to break in two directions at once, creating a combination pitch.\n\nSick Slider. To make the slider even nastier, use the same motion as a regular slider, but add an extra twist of the wrist at the end. This will give the pitch a bigger break and cause it to surprise the batter.\n\nSlider With Huge Break. For an extra sharp break on the slider, move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward with an outward twist of the wrist at the end. This will cause the pitch to break sharply as it approaches the plate.\n\nCurving Slider: With the holes on the left, grip at the middle with your index and middle finger. Move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward, releasing the ball with a twist of the wrist at the end. This will cause the pitch to break sharply and surprise the batter.\n\nShaking slider: Hold the ball with the holes on the right, and put your middle three fingers at the top of the ball. Move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward, causing the ball to break sharply in an unexpected direction.\n\nUltimate Slider. To make the slider even nastier, move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward with an outward twist of the wrist at the end. This will create an even bigger break on the pitch as it approaches the plate.\n\nAwesome Rising Slider. To give your slider an even bigger bite, move your arm in an unusual way. Instead of a straight three-quarter or half circle, arch your arm so that your arm ends up in a diagonal line from your shoulder to your fingertips. As you release the pitch, twist your wrist and add an upwards push. This will cause the pitch to break sharply and rise up over the plate.\n\nDo the One Fingered Slider. To make this pitch even harder for the batter to hit, hold the ball with one finger only in a three-fingered grip. As you release the pitch, try and put as much spin on it as possible with your one finger. This will cause the pitch to break sharply and move in an unpredictable way.\n\nDo a Drop Curve. To perform the drop curve, hold the ball with your middle three fingers at the top and your index and pinkie fingers at the bottom. As you release the pitch, twist your wrist and arm in an outward motion, causing the ball to break sharply as it approaches the plate.\n\nPerform a Sick Awesome Curve Ball. To make the curve even nastier, hold the ball with the holes to the left and the solid side on the right. Move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward with an outward twist at the end. This will cause the ball to break sharply and dive at the plate.\n\nThrow a Crazy-Curve Ball. For an even bigger curve, hold the ball with the holes to the left and the solid side to the right. Move your arm in a half circle and snap your wrist and arm forward with a big twist of the wrist at the end. This will cause the ball to curl sharply in different directions as it approaches the plate.\n\nDo a Curving Riser. To make the pitch even nastier, hold the ball like a screwball with the holes to the left and the solid side to the right. Move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward with a twist of the wrist at the end. This will cause the ball to break sharply at the plate and rise up over the batter.\n\nDo The Gurver. To perform the Gurver, hold the ball with your middle three fingers at the top and your index and pinkie fingers at the bottom. Move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward with an outward twist of the wrist at the end. This will cause the ball to curve sharply at the plate with a huge amount of break.\n\nTry a Late Curve. To make the pitch even harder to hit, hold the ball with the holes to the right and the solid side to the left. Move your arm in a three-quarter circle and snap your wrist and arm forward, releasing the ball with an upwards twist of the wrist at the end. The late release of the pitch will cause it to break sharply and dive at the plate.\n\nPerform the Slow Diving Curve. To perform the slow diving curve, hold the ball like a screwball with the holes to the left and the solid side to the right. Move your arm in a half circle and snap your wrist and arm forward with a",
        "Well, I'm not really sure what you mean by \"contingency plans\" or who Hitler is exactly, but I can try my best to answer your question in a way I understand.\n\nFrom what I've learned in school, there was a big fight called World War II going on and the United States wanted to help stop it. The Soviet Union and Britain were fighting against Hitler and his friends in something called the Axis Powers. If Hitler won against them, the United States would be in trouble too.\n\nSo, I think the United States probably had some plans in case that happened. Maybe they would try to make friends with Hitler and see if they could make a peace deal. Or maybe they would try to hide and protect themselves. I'm not really sure.\n\nBut I do know that the United States helped the Allies (that's what they called the good guys) by sending supplies and troops to fight in the war. And eventually, the Allies won and Hitler was defeated.\n\nI hope that kind of answers your question, but if you want to know more maybe you should ask a grown-up or a teacher.",

        " Please write a peer review for the paper of Regularizing Neural Networks by Penalizing Confident Output Distributions, its main content is as below: We propose regularizing neural networks by penalizing low entropy output distributions. We show that penalizing low entropy output distributions, which has been shown to improve exploration in reinforcement learning, acts as a strong regularizer in supervised learning. We connect our confidence penalty to label smoothing through the direction of the KL divergence between networks output distribution and the uniform distribution. We exhaustively evaluate our proposed confidence penalty and label smoothing (uniform and unigram) on 6 common benchmarks: image classification (MNIST and Cifar-10), language modeling (Penn Treebank), machine translation (WMT'14 English-to-German), and speech recognition (TIMIT and WSJ). We find that both label smoothing and our confidence penalty improve state-of-the-art models across benchmarks without modifying existing hyper-parameters. We also find that our confidence penalty is more effective than label smoothing in most cases.\n\nComment: This is not a peer review.\n\nComment: @D.W. I am not sure what you mean by peer review.

        "\nWe use recent experimental advancements in the field of charm physics to analyse the potential of new physics to modify rare charm meson decay rates. We look into the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) contributions to $c\\to u \\gamma$ decays in the presence of the updated $\\Delta m_D$ evidence, and find that due to the dominance of long distance physics, the $D \\to V \\gamma$ decay rates cannot be significantly modified. Subsequently, we consider the effect of extra heavy up vector-like quark models on the decay spectra of $D^+ \\to \\pi^+ l^+ l^-$ and $D_s^+ \\to K^+ l^+ l^-$ decays and explore the feasibility of a tiny increase of the differential decay rate within the region of high dilepton mass. We then focus on the R-parity violating supersymmetric model, examining the potential for short distance dynamics changes in $c \\to u l^+ l^-$ decays and test that hypothesis by comparing to the current upper limit for the $D^+ \\to \\pi^+ l^+ l^-$ decay rate, checking for any alterations to the $D_s^+ \\to K^+ l^+ l^-$ differential decay rate distribution.

        "Koszul duality, first discovered in the context of associative deformation theory, has an intriguing property: it holds without requiring the associative deformation to be trivial. In fact, it even holds without requiring the deformation to be realized via derivations. For quadratic algebras, this more general deformation has been shown to exist via a Koszul(-like) process, for which we give a detailed study in this paper. More precisely, we consider the more general setting of $\\mathbb{Z}$- graded objects in a symmetric monoidal category, which includes the associative algebra case as a special case. We show that the (large) exact functor defined by Yoneda on the (small) category of $\\mathbb{Z}$- graded objects in the symmetric monoidal category of interest, takes quadratic ( resp.

        "The transition from trying to fall asleep to actually sleeping involves a complex interplay of physiological changes in the brain. During this period, a series of changes occur in the brain, which can be broadly divided into two phases: the pre-sleep period and the sleep onset.\n\nDuring the pre-sleep period, which lasts for about 30 minutes, the brain prepares itself for sleep by reducing the activity levels of its many networks. In this phase, the brain reduces its sensory inputs and gradually decreases its metabolic rate. The brainstem then begins to release a chemical called GABA, which acts as a natural sedative, causing the person to become drowsy and relaxed. At the same time, the pineal gland in the brain releases melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles and induces sleep.\n\nThe second phase is called the sleep onset, which involves the transition from wakefulness to sleep. This phase is marked by a reduction in conscious awareness, as the brain's cortex, which is responsible for voluntary control and conscious processing, gradually becomes less active. This phase is also marked by an increase in brainwave patterns characteristic of sleep, such as theta and delta waves.\n\nDuring the sleep onset, several key regions of the brain play an important role in the transition to sleep. The thalamus, a relay station for sensory information, decreases its activity, leading to reduced awareness and perception of the external environment. The hippocampus, a key memory-processing area, replays the day's events and consolidates memories, preparing them for long-term storage.\n\nIn conclusion, the transition from trying to fall asleep to actually sleeping involves a complex interplay of physiological changes in the brain. During this period, the brain prepares itself for sleep by reducing its activity levels, releasing natural sedatives, and regulating sleep-wake cycles. Once the brain enters the sleep onset phase, several key regions of the brain begin to transition into sleep, leading to reduced awareness and perception of the external environment, consolidation of memories, and the production of sleepwave patterns.",
        "\n\n\nHow to Get Faster for Soccer\nBeing fast on the soccer field is essential for outplaying your opponents. It doesn’t matter if you’re a defender or a midfielder, you won’t be able to do your job if you can’t keep up. To become a faster soccer player, you should focus on sprint drills, do acceleration drills, use a speed ladder, do interval training, and train to improve reaction speed. You can also extend your joints, practice ball exercises, warm up, and focus on technique then speed. \n\nTo get faster for soccer, the first step is to focus on sprint drills. This means doing exercises that help you to achieve high speeds over short distances. Examples include sprints or short shuttle runs. For a drill, try alternating between jogging for 30 seconds then sprinting for 10 seconds. Increase your speed as you go and remember to rest for a few minutes between sets. Doing this type of drill can help increase your top speed. \n\nThe next step is to do acceleration drills. This type of drill helps you to build up speed quickly from a standing start. Some examples include doing short acceleration sprints, high knee skips, or leg kick drills. Start slowly and try to increase your speed with every few steps. This can help build up muscle in your legs, as well as improving your ability to accelerate quickly. \n\nUsing a speed ladder is also beneficial for soccer players. This is a ladder-shaped tool with each rung spaced at a certain distance apart. Speed ladder exercises can improve your agility, balance, and coordination. Make sure you focus on your technique while doing these drills, as this will help you to develop faster muscle reaction time. Begin by practicing easy drills such as two-footed hops and side-to-side shuffles before moving on to more complex drills.\n\nInterval training is also a great way to increase your speed on the field. This involves doing short bursts of exercise interspersed with other rest activities. This type of exercise will help you get used to using your speed in different situations. A simple example is a 2:1 ratio. You can run as fast as you can for two minutes, then walk for one minute. This should be repeated five times with a rest break in between.\n\nTrain to also improve your reaction speed. On the soccer field, being able to change direction quickly is essential. You can do this through agility drills which involve sharp turns and darting movements. An example is a carioca drill, in which players alternate between stepping laterally, then turning and running in the opposite direction.\n\nIn addition to sprint and agility drills, there are other ways you can get faster for soccer. Extending your joints is important as this can help you move more freely and without restriction. This is especially helpful in sports which require a lot of movement such as soccer. You can do this by doing exercises such as jumping jacks. \n\nPracticing with a ball is also important. You can do this by kicking a football against a wall, juggling, or dribbling around cones or markers. This will help you to keep control of the ball no matter how fast you’re running. Warming up is also important, as it will help to prepare your muscles for the activity ahead. \n\nTo get faster, you should focus on speed training first. This is best done within the first part of a practice session. This involves plyometric drills such as hops, jumps, and bounding, as well as weight lifting exercises such as squats, push ups, and pull ups.\n\nIt is important to rest periodically too. Speed training takes a lot out of the body, and it’s essential to give yourself time to recover between sessions. Finally, when you’re doing speed drills, make sure you focus on your technique first before focusing on speed. This means perfecting the exercise first before going any faster. With these tips in mind, you’ll be ready to outrun your opponents on the soccer field in no time.",
        "\n\nHow to Redefine Yourself\n\nRedefining yourself can be an empowering and liberating experience. You can choose to change what defines you with some thoughtful planning and preparations. It takes time, space, and understanding to successfully accomplish this important project, so be sure you are ready to devote the necessary energy. Whether you need something new or are looking for a complete overhaul, you can learn how to redefine yourself by following these steps. \n\nDetermine what defines the current you.\nThe first step to redefining yourself is to understand who you are at the moment. Take time for self-reflection and ask yourself questions like, “What am I like now? What have I achieved so far? What do I need to keep in my life? What must I let go of?” Identifying both the positive and negatives helps you to assess what you need to keep in your life and what needs to be removed. \n\nExplore your relationship with yourself.\nOur relationship with ourselves affects how we view ourselves and how others see us. Discerning our connection can help us understand if we love or dislike ourselves, if we accept or reject ourselves, or whether we feel that our opinion is valid or invalid. \n\nTalk to yourself about yourself.\nCreating a dialogue with yourself can give insight into where you are and help you come up with solutions as to who you want to become. Ask yourself if what you’ve been saying or doing is appropriate, or if maybe it’s time for some changes. \n\nRealize it’s never too late to reinvent yourself.\nWhen we think about changing, it can often feel like it’s too late, but that isn’t true. No matter our age, background, or accomplishments, we all have the power to redefine ourselves. \n\nLet go of the past.\nThe more we cling to the past, the harder it will be to move forward. Instead of holding on, forgive yourself or other from any wrongdoings and move on. Learning from the past can be beneficial, but dwelling on it can only keep us stuck. \n\nLearn from past mistakes.\nIt’s important to pay attention to the mistakes we’ve made. Examine the missteps you've taken and try to learn from them. Focus on what you have learned and use that wisdom as fuel as you embark on this journey. \n\nChoose one bad habit to break.\nMaking the conscious effort to change just one bad habit can open the door for many other new habits. Maybe you start with making your bed, or even meditating for 10 minutes daily. Be sure to choose something that is doable yet challenging. Doing something that is too daunting can leave you feeling unmotivated.\n\nReplace negative thoughts with positive ones.\nNegative self-talk can be detrimental to rediscovering ourselves. Instead, focus on replacing your negative thoughts with positive ones. Believe it or not, the words we say to ourselves are powerful, so be sure to speak with kindness to yourself. \n\nStop worrying about others' opinions.Your opinion of yourself is formed in part by your idea of how others see you. They can shape our opinion of the world around us, but ultimately it’s us who creates our own lives. Instead of worrying about others opinions, focus on what is important to you. \n\nEvaluate your priorities.\nAsk yourself which aspects of your life should be treated with the most care regardless of whether those aspects actually receive the care they deserve. Think about how you want your life to look, and determine what aspects need your attention. \n\nAsk yourself which qualities you'd like to develop.\nMake a list of the qualities you’d like to develop. This list should include both physical and personality traits. Examples of potential qualities may include confidence, empathy, or even public speaking. \n\nMake a plan.\nDo your best to break down the task of redefining yourself into achievable steps. Develop a plan to move forward and think of all the potential obstacles. Anticipate any challenges and make sure you have contingencies in place.\n\nSpend a little time each day pursuing your goals.\nSet aside a little time each day to do something that contributes to redefining yourself. It could be something as mundane as researching a topic or as thrilling as archery! Investing in this activity daily is a surefire way to make progress. \n\nStep out of your comfort zone.\nSeeking out new experiences, people, and places is a great way to change yourself. Don’t be afraid of trying something you’ve never done before. Consider enrolling in classes or joining a club. \n\nPursue an old passion.\nHave you ever revisited a lost hobby or passion of yours? Doing so can help you to remember who you were and use that same passion to help you become who you are now. A hobby can give life a sense of purpose. \n\nMeet new people and make new friends.\nMeeting new people can open the door for many valuable moments and experiences. Try being intentional and open-minded when engaging with others and seek out relationships that can help you grow. \n\nTake a moment to reconnect each morning.\nMaking the effort to take a moment or two for yourself each morning can be a great way to move through the day. Choose something that can help you become present in the present moment. This could be a meditation or a few moments of deep breathing. \n\nMove along at a steady pace.\nUnderstand that redefining yourself doesn't happen overnight. Change is an incremental process and requires patience. Celebrate and take it all in, but remember to take small steps and then follow through with those steps to make lasting changes. \n\nRemember, why we do things offers more insight into who we are than how we do them. Redefining yourself can be a long process and it takes time to have sustainable results. Push yourself and stay committed to your goals and enjoy the journey. You can redefine yourself anytime and anywhere with the right understanding and approach. So go ahead, and redefine yourself!",

        "\n\nInstalling outdoor electric wiring can be done in several different ways depending on the complexity of the project and the space available to the homeowner. Before beginning this project, however, a homeowner should determine which method is the most desirable- direct burial of a cable under soil, using PVC electrical pipe (PVC) buried under soil with conductors installed in it, or the aerial/overhead method.\n\nDirect burial of type \"UF\" cable under soil is probably the most common and least expensive method. Once a trench is dug a minimum of 18 inches deep and the required length is determined, the cable is then laid along it. Once the cable is in the ground, it should be supported every 30-36 inches with approved supports manufactured for the purpose. After it is all installed, a wire inspector should be contacted to ensure the work has been done correctly before the trench can be backfilled.\n\nThe PVC pipe method is quite similar except that it allows for additional circuits to be installed as needed without the labor of excavating and trenching again. A similar trench of 18 inches minimum should be dug and the pipe laid. As with the direct burial method, PVC supports are required to secure the pipe to the ground at 30-36 inch intervals. Again, be sure to contact an electrical inspector before backfilling the trench. A PVC “expansion joint” must also be included where the pipe emerges from the ground to penetrate the wall or an exterior enclosure.\n\nA “fish tape” or “snake” needs to be used to pull the wire into the pipe from one end. Once the snake is pulled back out the opposite end, attach the conductors and secure with electrical tape. \n\nFinally, the aerial/overhead method should only be considered if the run is short and the wiring can be installed without becoming a hazard to vehicles or pedestrians. A rated type “UF” cable that is designed to withstand sun exposure and moisture should be used in combination with approved strain relief fittings. \n\nWhether using direct burial, PVC pipe or the aerial/overhead method, a qualified electrical inspector should always check the work before any backfilling of the trench is done. Doing this will assure the safety of the wiring, as well as peace of mind for the homeowner.",

He would go on to record four successful seasons on Tour before winning his first event, the 2007 Valero Texas Open. After this breakthrough win, Randall's career saw a number of highs and lows, but he continued to compete on the Tour. In 2009, Randall was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer, forcing him to take a break from the professional golfing circuit. During his break, Randall underwent months of chemotherapy and radiation treatments, eventually succumbing to the disease in 2010. Since his passing, Randall has been immortalized with the Tommy Randall Memorial Fund, which has been established to raise money to help other cancer patients with medical and non-medical expenses. The Fund has been so successful that the PGA Tour has included it as part of the 2014 PGA Tour schedule. Randall's memory lives on in his hometown, where the city of Naperville has built a memorial statue and garden to honor him. The memorial park is located near the golf course which Randall used to frequent. It includes a sculpture of a golfer teeing off, and a quote from Randall inscribed in the statue’s base: \"The harder you work, the luckier you get.\" Throughout his career, Randall personified the phrase “hard work pays off”, and remains an inspiration for young golfers today. His legacy will continue for many years to come.",

        "\n\nA buzz box is a portable welding machine that uses a car battery to create an electric arc. It is a popular tool for farmers, ranchers, and other people who need to do light welding, as it is more portable and cost-effective than a gas-powered welder. \n\nTo weld with a buzz box, you will need to connect the positive and negative clips to the battery, and then connect the ground clamp to a piece of metal. Next, you will need to start the weld by holding the electrode against the metal and turning on the current. You will need to keep the electrode in contact with the metal until the weld is complete. Finally, you will need to turn off the welder and disconnect it from the battery.\n\nIt's important to note that welding with a buzz box can be dangerous, so it's important to take proper safety precautions. Always wear gloves, a welder's helmet, and other safety gear to protect yourself from the heat and sparks. Additionally, it's important to keep a safe distance from any flammable materials or other people.",

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"Laplacian spectra of complex networks and random walks on them: Are scale-free architectures really important?\".\nAbstract:\nWe study the Laplacian spectrum of complex networks, focusing in particular on its relation to the dynamics of random walks on them. We show that for any network with n nodes there are at most 2n eigenvalues different from zero (counting multiplicities). This bound is tight up to a constant factor when applied to trees or complete graphs. For general graphs we prove an upper bound of O(n log n) on the number of distinct nonzero eigenvalues. In addition, we provide lower bounds showing that this estimate cannot be improved by more than a polylogarithmic factor. Finally, we present numerical evidence suggesting that real-world networks have only few distinct nonzero eigenvalues. These results suggest that the spectral properties of complex networks may not depend strongly on their degree distribution but rather on other structural features such as clustering coefficients. The analysis presented here can also be used to derive new bounds on mixing times of Markov chains defined over these networks.",

We show that these vector-valued modular forms can be expressed as infinite series involving classical theta-functions associated to quadratic imaginary number fields (or equivalently, Jacobi forms).  In particular, we prove an analogue of the Kronecker limit formula for such vector-valued modular forms by expressing them as infinite products over primes.  As applications, we give explicit formulas for the Fourier coefficients of vector-valued modular forms corresponding to cuspidal representations of $GL_2(\\mathbb Q_p)$.

        "As an AI language model, I do not endorse or condone any illegal activities, including piracy. However, I can give you a technical explanation of the difference in quality between piracy and iTunes.\n\nFirstly, iTunes uses a compression method called AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) to reduce file size without significantly compromising audio quality. It uses a bit rate of 256 kbps (kilobits per second) to save space and ensure compatibility with all devices. On the other hand, some pirated music copies are sourced from original CD or vinyl, which have a higher bit rate (usually 1411 kbps). This results in a more detailed and wider range of frequencies, which can make the audio sound \"richer\" and more dynamic.\n\nSome piracy websites also offer FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) files, which are completely uncompressed, resulting in the highest possible audio quality. However, these files take up a lot of space and are not compatible with most devices. Moreover, some piracy websites may re-encode the FLAC files to a lower bit rate, so the quality may not always be guaranteed.\n\nIn conclusion, while piracy may offer higher quality audio than iTunes, it remains illegal and unethical. It is essential to support artists and the music industry by purchasing music legally from trusted sources. Music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music also offer high-quality audio at a reasonable price, making it easier and more convenient to enjoy music legally.",
        "In the LA riots, law enforcement officials shot at individuals who were committing crimes (i.e. looting) and individuals who were actively attacking police officers. On Monday, August 27, 1992, between 5 PM and 9 PM, 58 people were killed and hundreds more were injured. Of the 58 killed, 26 were killed by police bullets, 38 were killed by other bullets, and 2 were killed by lynching. y were 58 people killed over a 3 day period in the 1992 LA riots? The death toll includes both police bullets, other bullets, and lynchings. The majority of deaths were due to police bullets and other bullets. The LA riots started on Thursday, August 23, 1992 after a jury acquitted 4 police officers who beat Rodney King. The riots lasted 6 days and spread to nine cities. The riots were capped off on Sunday, August 26, 1992 when the LA police department bombarded minority neighborhoods with helicopters and tear gas, which only fueled more riots. The riots were an aftermath of a trial that found not guilty verdicts for 4 police officers who beat Rodney King. The police were not found guilty of excessive force, but the jury of 6 middle-aged White people thought the police actions were disproportionate to the force used against Rodney King. The verdict outraged many Los Angeles residents who were frustrated with the LAPD and the jury system. As a result, many people went on a rampage, looting and destroying businesses in minority neighborhoods. Over the course of 6 days, there were 58 deaths. 26 people were killed by police bullets, 38 people were killed by other bullets, and 2 people were killed by lynching.

        "\n\n\nHow to Delete Protected System Fonts in Windows 7\nWe all know that there are certain system fonts that are required for Windows 7 to run correctly. The problem is, those fonts can't be easily removed since they are protected by the system and require certain permissions to properly remove them. In this guide, we'll show you how to delete any protected system fonts in Windows 7 and ensure they don't bother you ever again.\n\nFirst, you need to determine if the font actually is a protected system font or not. To do this, open the Registry Editor (type \"regedit\" in the start menu search box and hit enter). Then, on the left side of the Editor, open the folders HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE → Software → Microsoft → Windows NT → CurrentVersion → Fonts. On the right side of the window, you should see a list of all the installed fonts. All system fonts are noted with either a \"(TrueType)\" or \"(TTF)\" tag on the end of their names. Make a note of all the protected system fonts you want to delete.\n\nOnce you've determined the fonts you want to remove, open any program in which you can change the font. Then, navigate to the folder C:\\Windows\\winsxs. You should see a long list of folders, scroll about a fifth of the way down and you should see a series of folders beginning with \"amd64_microsoft-windows-font-truetype-\", where  is the name of a font. Right click on the folder containing the font you want to delete and select \"Properties\".\n\nClick the \"Security\" tab and click the \"Advanced\" button at the bottom of the window. Click the \"Owner\" tab in the resulting window, then click \"Edit\". In the new window, click on either \"Administrators\" or the name of your account, check the box next to \"Replace owner on subcontainers and objects,\" and click OK. Click OK on all the other Properties windows you opened to get out of them.\n\nOpen the folder's properties again (right click on it and select \"Properties\"), click the \"Security\" tab, and click \"Edit\". Select the account you chose in step 11, check the box under \"Full control\", and click \"OK\". Exit the Properties window.\n\nNow that the permissions have been changed, you can delete the font file and folder. To delete the font file first, right click on it and select \"Delete\". Then delete the parent folder containing the font. Once you've done that, open the Registry Editor again and delete the font's entry. \n\nFinally, restart your computer to ensure that the font is no longer present, and you're finished! With the above steps, you should have no problem deleting protected system fonts in Windows 7. And with the font completely removed, you can free up some storage space and make sure that the font won't cause any more issues. ",

        "In this work, we investigate the cosmic streaming field at low redshift, with the aim of understanding the dynamics of dark matter structures. Our methodology involves using the data from the IllustrisTNG simulations and computing the velocity field of the dark matter halos. We analyze the coherence and anisotropy of the velocity field, as well as the kinetic and potential energy density distributions.\n\nOur results show that the cosmic streaming field is strongly anisotropic, with the direction of the velocity field aligned with the major axis of the dark matter structures. We also observe a clear correlation between the anisotropy of the velocity field and the alignment of the structures. Furthermore, we find that the kinetic and potential energy densities are strongly correlated with the halo mass, with massive halos displaying a more concentrated and isotropic energy distribution.\n\nThe problem that our work attempts to solve is the understanding of the formation and evolution of dark matter structures, which play a key role in the cosmological paradigm. By analyzing the cosmic streaming field, we gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the motion of dark matter halos, and how their properties are linked to the large-scale structure of the Universe. Our findings provide important constraints on theoretical models of dark matter and cosmology.",

        "Huo Qubing was a prominent general of the Han dynasty, known for his military prowess and strategic acumen. He was born in Changyi, in what is now Shandong province, China, in 140 BC. Huo Qubing joined the military when he was just 17 years old and became known for his fearlessness and courage in battles. Huo Qubing rose to prominence during the war against the Xiongnu, a confederation of nomadic tribes that frequently raided the Han territories. In 121 BC, he was appointed as a general and tasked with leading an expedition against the Xiongnu forces. This campaign was a resounding success, and Huo Qubing scored several decisive victories against the enemy. He used innovative tactics, such as using horse archers to flank the enemy and cut off their retreat. One of the most famous battles of Huo Qubing was the Battle of Mobei, which took place in 119 BC. He led a force of cavalry to attack a large Xiongnu army that was entrenched near the Mobei region. In a surprise attack, Huo Qubing was able to defeat the enemy and capture their leader, which dealt a severe blow to the Xiongnu's morale. Huo Qubing's military exploits earned him the title of \"Marquis of Hanshe\" and made him a popular hero among the Han people. He continued to serve in the military under Emperor Wu until his death in 117 BC. After his death, he was posthumously awarded the title of \"Marquis Wu\" and became one of the \"Three Heroes of the Early Han Dynasty,\" along with Wei Qing and Li Guang. Huo Qubing's legacy continues to inspire the Chinese people today. He is remembered for his bravery, intelligence, and loyalty to his country. Statues and memorials have been erected in his honor, and his story has been retold in countless books and movies. He remains a symbol of China's martial spirit and determination to defend its borders against foreign invaders.",
        "Well, I don't know if it would have been a thing at that time, because, from what I heard, cosmetic plastic surgery wasn't widespread until the 1930s. Even then, it wasn't as popular as it is today. I guess it would have been very risky for someone to get any kind of surgery in 1919, because there wasn't very much technology or techniques available, so it could have easily gone wrong. Plus, if you got it wrong, it could have left some serious scars and stuff. \n\nI also heard that even if someone did manage to get cosmetic surgery back in 1919, it wasn't even close to as successful as nowadays, because they didn't really have all the tools that surgeons have now. So, if the actress did get a nose job between seasons one and two of 'Peaky Blinders', the odds probably won't be in her favor. \n\nEven today, nowadays cosmetic surgery can go wrong pretty easily, so back in 1919 it probably wasn't as good.

And if it did, it would have left pretty severe scarring. \n\nSo, I guess it would have been pretty risky for the actress to get any kind of surgery in 1919, and if she did, there's a good chance it didn't turn out that great and could have left her with bad scars. But at least today we have much better technology, techniques and surgeons that make the process safer and more successful.",

        "When She Cries is a song that was released in 1992 by the American country music band, Restless Heart. The song was written by Dave Robbins and Van Stephenson, two of the band’s members, along with collaborator, Tim DuBois. When She Cries is an emotionally charged ballad that explores the pain and heartbreak of a woman who is struggling to come to terms with a failed relationship. The song became a huge hit for Restless Heart, reaching number one on both the Billboard Hot Country Songs and the RPM Country Tracks charts in the United States and Canada respectively. It was also nominated for several awards, including a Grammy for Best Country Song and a Country Music Association Award for Single of the Year. The lyrics of When She Cries are poignant and relatable, touching on the universal themes of love and loss. The song begins with the narrator describing the woman’s tears falling “like rain” and going on to explore her feelings of despair and loneliness. Despite the song’s critical and commercial success, the members of Restless Heart eventually parted ways in 1994. However, When She Cries remains a fan favorite, often considered one of the band’s signature songs. The song has been covered by several other artists, including Molly Hatchet and Chris Young. The success of When She Cries also highlighted the songwriting talent of both Robbins and Stephenson. Stephenson passed away in 2001 after a battle with cancer, while Robbins remains a successful songwriter, having penned hits for artists such as Eric Clapton and Kenny Rogers. In conclusion, When She Cries remains a classic ballad that explores the complexities of love and heartbreak in a truly visceral way. Its emotional lyrics and powerful vocals make it a timeless song that continues to resonate with fans of country music decades after its initial release.",
        "\nThis paper presents a novel approach to the SM of particle physics and the Feynman-Weinberg theory of quantum gravity in order to provide a unified theory of everything. It examines the implementation of cosmological boundary conditions that make the theory finite, in order to eliminate the divergence infinities normally 'renormalized away'. Additionally, this approach resolves various cosmological issues, such as the horizon, flatness and isotropy problems, and explanes a scale-free, Gaussian, adiabatic perturbation spectrum. The quantum mechanical requirement of a Planckian spectrum in the initial state of the $SU(2)_L$ gauge field implies that if the field has managed to survive thermalization until this day, it will explain the observed dark matter and dark energy. There is also a possibility that the $SU(2)_L$ nature of the CMBR has been seen in the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. This paper suggests several experiments that can be used to test the hypothesis.",
        "Shakespeare's plays are a cornerstone of the Western literary tradition, full of both artistic and historical import. But there are arguments to be made for the idea that some of them are represented more accurately than others, particularly with regard to the historical details they contain. Of the many plays attributed to Shakespeare, the one that is arguably the most historically accurate is Henry V.\n\nFirst and foremost, Henry V was written during a time of great historical change, with a number of significant conflicts occurring close to the time it was written. Henry V also dealt with a period of English history which was well documented, so it was easier for Shakespeare to draw on reliable sources for this work. It is believed that he drew on four main sources when creating the play: The Famous Victories of Henry V, Polydore Vergil, Hall's Chronicle and Holinshed's Chronicles. This makes it much more likely that the play would have been historically accurate.\n\nFurthermore, Henry V contains a number of details which closely replicate what happened in history at the time. For example, the play famously deals with the Siege of Harfleur, including a detailed account of how the English army entered the city and the impact it had on French morale. This closely replicates what happened in history, with the English army entering Harfleur in 1415 and the siege lasting over two months. This suggests that Shakespeare was dedicated to accurately representing history in his plays.\n\nAdditionally, the play contains references to contemporary politics and figures. This includes mentions of the English King Henry V, who is widely believed to have been Shakespeare's source of inspiration. He also mentions the French King Charles VI and Duke of Bourbon, who served as leaders of the French forces in the era. Even smaller details such as the presence of Joan of Arc and archbishop Henry Beaufort are mentioned, showing that Shakespeare was very knowledgeable on the time period and accurate in his portrayal of it.\n\nOverall, Henry V is the play which stands out as the most historically accurate of Shakespeare's works. The play was based on a range of sources from the time period, was researched in depth and contained a number of accurate details. Henry V set the bar for Shakespeare's plays in terms of historical accuracy and would remain an impressive work for many centuries after its creation.",
        "The Ottoman Devshirme system, which was introduced in the 15th century and continued for over 200 years, is often viewed through the lens of the negative terms used to describe it such as 'kidnapping' and 'stealing'. It involved the recruitment of Christian children from the Balkans and Anatolia in the Ottoman Empire, and it was seen as a crucial tool of Ottoman expansion and survival in the face of its enemies.\n\nHowever, there is evidence to suggest that although negative language was used to describe it, it was not necessarily universally viewed in this way. For example, when the Ottoman Empire converted to Islam in the 15th century, Bosnian Muslims requested that they too be included in the Devshirme system. This suggests that they viewed the system in a positive light, as it offered their children a path to social mobility, education, and access to the highest echelons of Ottoman society.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that, despite the Devshirme system being intended to benefit the Ottomans, it also brought benefits to the people it recruited. In most cases, the recruits were offered a degree of freedom and opportunity that would not have otherwise been available to them. For example, many of these recruits ended up becoming highly respected and influential judges, diplomats, and military officers. This implies that the Devshirme system was viewed positively by those it affected.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that those recruited from the Balkans and Anatolia were able to maintain their culture and religion and did not have to convert to Islam, contrary to the common misconception about Devshirme. This suggests that many people saw the system as a beneficial opportunity rather than as oppression.\n\nOverall, it is clear that although the Devshirme system has been historically viewed as a negative practice, it was not necessarily universally seen in this way. While negative language was used to describe it, its benefits were also appreciated by those it affected, as evidenced by the inclusion of Bosnian Muslims and the continued acceptance of the system throughout the Ottoman Empire.

The PSMM is a variant of the Sentinel Mixture Model (SMM), which is a simple yet effective model for NER. The SMM uses a two-stage training process, where a \"sentinel\" model is first trained to detect potential NER tokens, and then a \"pointer\" model is trained to classify the detected NER tokens. The PSMM combines the two stages of the SMM into a single model, which is trained end-to-end.\n\nThe paper presents experimental results showing that the PSMM achieves better NER performance than the SMM on the CoNLL-2003 and CoNLL-2012 datasets. The results also show that the PSMM is more efficient than the SMM, as it requires less training time and fewer parameters.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a well-reasoned approach to training a NER model that is both effective and efficient. The experimental results are convincing, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.",

        "\n\nArnold was a capable officer and an able leader who served the patriot cause well, but he was also an opportunist who used the Revolution for his own purposes. Arnold was a businessman who, like many of the founding fathers, speculated in land and other ventures using money borrowed from foreign investors. Unlike many of the founders, Arnold was in significant debt, and when the Revolution began, he found himself unable to secure new funding.\n\nIn 1775, the Continental Congress commissioned Arnold as a commander in the Continental Army. In the summer of 1777, he distinguished himself in the battle for Fort Ticonderoga. The following year, he led a daring expedition through the wilderness of Maine to the sea, capturing the British garrison at Valcour Island on Lake Champlain. Arnold was seriously wounded in the leg, and he spent the winter of 1778 in the hospital. When he recovered, he was given command of Philadelphia. Arnold was popular in the city, and he lived with his mistress, Margaret \"Peggy\" Shippen, whom he eventually married.\n\nWhen the war ended, Arnold's debts continued to mount, and he became desperate for cash. He also became convinced that the country would never be able to pay the debts owed to him and other veterans of the war. He started looking for other ways to make money, including speculation in land and other business ventures.\n\nIn 1780, Arnold received a letter from the British government offering him a commission in the army and a generous annual salary of £6,000 (approximately $1 million today). Arnold was also promised a loan of £10,000 (approximately $2 million today) to cover his debts. Arnold was convinced that the country could never repay its debts to him and that his future financial security depended on his joining the British army.\n\nArnold also felt that he had been mistreated by the Continental Congress and the state governments. He had been repeatedly passed over for promotion, and he had been denied the rank of major general. In 1778, he had been court-martialed for using harsh measures in putting down a mutiny, and he had been found guilty of using excessive force. He was also angry that the Continental Congress had not given him any money to help pay his debts.\n\nIn 1780, Arnold met with the British agent Major John André to discuss his plans to betray West Point. André was captured by the Americans, and Arnold was forced to flee to New York City. He eventually sailed to England, where he lived out the rest of his life.\n\nHistorians have taken a more sympathetic view of Arnold in recent years. They point out that he was a product of his time, and that he was not the only one to profit from the Revolution. They also note that he was not a traitor, since he did not join the British army until after the war had ended.",

        "In this work, we investigate the composition of the pseudoscalar eta and eta' mesons. Studying the properties of these particles is crucial for advancing our understanding of the strong interaction and the dynamics of quarks. The motivation for this research stems from the fact that the eta and eta' mesons have similar masses and quantum numbers, yet their decays and production mechanisms differ significantly. This has led to ongoing debates regarding the role of gluonic degrees of freedom in their composition.\n\nFirst, we perform a comprehensive analysis of experimental data on the decays of eta and eta' mesons to various final states, using the framework of QCD-inspired models. We then compare the results of our analysis to other available theoretical models and discuss their implications for the composition of the eta and eta' mesons.\n\nOur research demonstrates that a pure quark-antiquark model can only partially account for the observed decay properties of the eta and eta' mesons. Additional gluonic degrees of freedom are necessary to explain the data fully. Our work provides new insights into the dynamics of strongly interacting systems and may have implications for ongoing efforts to understand the nature of the QCD vacuum.",
        " Write a peer review by first describing what problem or question this paper addresses, then strengths and weaknesses, for the paper Deep unsupervised learning through spatial contrasting, its main content is as below: Convolutional networks have marked their place over the last few years as the best performing model for various visual tasks. They are, however, most suited for supervised learning from large amounts of labeled data. Previous attempts have been made to use unlabeled data to improve model performance by applying unsupervised techniques. These attempts require different architectures and training methods. In this work we present a novel approach for unsupervised training of Convolutional networks that is based on contrasting between spatial regions within images.  This criterion can be employed within conventional neural net- works and trained using standard techniques such as SGD and back-propagation, thus complementing supervised methods. We show that this approach can be used to learn features that are useful for a variety of tasks, including image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. We also show that the learned features can be used to improve the performance of supervised models.",

        "Plays have dialogue and characters that can change depending on who is playing them while films do not. Film scripts only contain lines of dialog written by screenwriters which will always remain exactly as they were written in the script. Plays also often include stage directions telling actors how to deliver their lines or what actions to take during certain parts of the play. This makes it possible for different people to perform the same play differently each time it's performed. While this may seem like an insignificant difference between plays and film scripts, these differences make plays more similar to literary works than film scripts because they allow readers/audience members to interpret the text based off of themselves rather than just reading from someone else's interpretation (the actor). Because plays require audience participation through imagination, they are seen as being closer to \"literature\" then \"film scripts\" where there isn't any interaction with the reader/viewer other than watching something already created",
        "Title: Obtaining referential word meanings from visual and distributional information: Experiments on object naming\n\nAuthors: John Doe and Jane Smith\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe paper proposes an approach to obtain referential word meanings using both visual and distributional information. The authors conducted experiments on object naming to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\nMethodology:\n\nThe authors gathered data by presenting participants with images of objects and asking them to name the objects. They then extracted visual features from the images and created a distributional model using a large corpus of text data. The model was used to generate word embeddings for the target words, and a clustering algorithm was used to group the embeddings into semantic clusters. The authors evaluated the model's effectiveness by measuring its performance on three tasks: predicting object labels from visual features, predicting object labels from distributional information, and predicting object labels from both visual and distributional information.\n\nResults:\n\nThe authors found that the model performed well on all tasks, with the best performance achieved when using both visual and distributional information. They also reported that there were differences in the semantic structure of the embeddings obtained from visual and distributional information, indicating that they capture different aspects of word meaning.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe proposed approach is innovative and shows promising results. However, the authors should provide more details on the clustering algorithm used and explain the rationale behind the choice of the number of clusters. In addition, it would be interesting to see a comparison with other state-of-the-art models in the field.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors successfully demonstrate a novel approach for obtaining referential word meanings using both visual and distributional information. The results presented in the paper validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, but some shortcomings need to be addressed to further strengthen the study's validity.",
        "\n\nGeneralised Einstein condition and cone construction for parabolic geometries\n\nWe consider the problem of constructing a geometrically-induced self-similar solution for the Einstein equations in vacuum, which is applicable to a wide class of self-similar solutions for the Einstein equations, including self-similar solutions with a structure of concentric spherical shells, the so-called Einstein eggs. We show that such a construction can be obtained by introducing a certain non-self-collapsing solution for the Einstein equations, which we call the generalised Einstein condition. The main tool in the construction is the cone construction, which we develop in some detail. The construction of a geometrically-induced self-similar solution for the Einstein equations in a vacuum has some practical applications in the theory of geometrically-induced energy fluctuations in a vacuum, in the theory of elementary particles and in the theory of black holes. It also has some fundamental implications for the theory of the Einstein equations and the theory of self-similar solutions.",

Abstract:\nRivière-des-Chenaux is the largest river in Quebec, Canada and one of its longest rivers at 1,530 km (941 mi). It rises on the northern slopes of Mount Kaaikop near Lac-Simon, northwestern Quebec, flows generally southward through the Canadian Shield to Lake Champlain where it joins the Richelieu River which empties into the St Lawrence Seaway.\nThe name \"Chenal\" means \"channel or straits\" in French; this word was used by Jacques Cartier when he explored the area during his second voyage to New France in 1535-36.  The English translation \"river of channels\" reflects that meaning as well.   In some places along its length there are narrower sections known locally as \"channels\"; these include the Grand Canal de Beauharnois between Lakes Saint-Louis and Saint-François, the Petit Chenal du Moine between lakes Memphrémagog and Massawipi, and the Petit Chenal du Nord between lakes Taureau and Ours.

        "Yes, there is some truth to this idea. Many people feel a sensation in their throat when they are truly hungry and this is often referred to as true hunger. This feeling is sometimes described as 'hollowness' in one's throat, or a feeling of 'emptiness' in the stomach. True hunger is caused by lack of food in the body and a related drop in blood sugar levels. This is why it usually happens when you have gone too long without eating.\n\nThe feeling of hunger in the stomach is usually caused by withdrawal from unhealthy eating. This happens when our bodies have become used to high-carbohydrate, sugary foods that are not necessarily nutritious. When these snacks, sweets, and fast foods are taken away, our bodies will crave them and cause us to feel hungry. This means that our bodies are just looking for more of what they're used to and don't realize they need something healthier.\n\nIt's important, then, to practice mindful eating. Eat when you are actually feeling hungry and do not eat out of boredom or just to 'get rid' of the feeling of hunger in the stomach. Also, choose healthier food and snacks that are good for you and your body, as these will help curb the unhealthy cravings. Of course, it's also a good idea to get plenty of exercise and drink lots of water. These habits can help too.",
        "Parrots are one of the most intelligent and fascinating birds in the world, known for their remarkable ability to speak and mimic human speech. Parrots belong to the Psittaciformes order and can imitate sounds made by humans, other birds, and even other animals. Although it may seem like magic, the process of how parrots speak is rooted in science and biology.\n\nFirstly, the process of parrot speech involves complex coordination between the respiratory system, the larynx, and the syrinx. When a parrot wants to speak, it first breathes in air and then exhales it over its vocal cords. This produces sound waves that are filtered through the various chambers of the bird's vocal tract, including the oropharynx, the tongue, and the beak. The resulting sound is then amplified and modified before being released as speech.\n\nSecondly, parrots learn to speak by mimicking sounds they hear in their environment. This process is similar to the way human babies learn to talk by imitation and repetition. Parrots have a highly developed and flexible vocal tract, which enables them to mimic a wide range of sounds with remarkable accuracy. In fact, some parrots can even learn to speak multiple languages!\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that not all parrots can speak. Only a few species, such as the African Grey Parrot and the Amazon Parrot, have the ability to speak with a high level of clarity and comprehension. Other species, such as the Cockatoo, are less effective at speech but can still make a range of other sounds.\n\nIn conclusion, parrots are able to speak due to a combination of complex biological processes and their ability to learn and imitate sounds in their environment. The ability to mimic human speech is a unique and fascinating aspect of these birds, and one that continues to captivate scientists and bird enthusiasts around the world.",
        "Although water is clear and nearly invisible, snow is white. Snow is actually frozen water and is made up of ice crystals. Ice crystals form when water in the atmosphere is so cold that it freezes. When water freezes, the molecules arrange themselves in a six-sided crystal pattern and the spaces between these crystals reflect the light in many directions. This is what makes snow look white to us.\n\nSnow can also contain dust particles, which are usually from the air, that land on the snowflakes. The dust particles make the reflection of the light even brighter, giving us that bright white color when we look at it. Snow can also appear in different shades, like yellow or blue, even though it is not always easy to see it that way.\n\nWhen snow is deep enough, it forms a nice covering over tall trees or your house. That is why the world around us looks white when we have a lot of snow. The snow reflects and scatters the light in many directions, making it look white even though water is normally clear. So that is why snow can look white even though water is clear and not normally seen.",

HD 100546 is a star similar to our Sun, but is located 17 light-years away from us. In 1995, it was discovered to have a disk of dust surrounding it, by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope. We have now imaged this dust disk with unprecedented resolution, and have discovered that it is much more complicated than astronomers had previously realised. In particular, we find that the disk has at least one ring-like feature, in addition to the central disk. We also find that the dust is not distributed evenly in the disk, but is instead clumped together in several places. Our results are consistent with the disk having been perturbed by the passage of a planet or planets, and provide a dramatic demonstration of the power of Hubble to study the disks of dust and gas surrounding stars.",
        "The answer to this lies in an important principle in biology known as cell turnover. The idea here is that every single cell in your body is being replaced either through division (this is what occurs during mitosis) or apoptosis (programmed cell death). The reason you're not completely covered in cells is because every 7-10 years, the majority of cells are not involved in maintaining your vital functions (e.g. liver or gut cells) and are subsequently removed by apoptosis. This means that when you were younger, you had more cells and therefore more skin covered in marks. However, even with this turnover, you will still have some cells that were present at the time of your birth and some that were present at the time you had your first beer.

The merging process is accompanied by the appearance of dark solitons, which can be identified as topological defects in the density distribution of each individual condensate. We show how these defects evolve into vortices during the merger process. In addition to this direct route towards vortex generation we also demonstrate another method for creating vortices based on interference between multiple condensates. This second approach allows us to create stable vortex states with high winding numbers (up to 12). Our results provide new insights into the dynamics of interacting quantum fluids at low temperatures. Vortices play an important role in many areas of physics ranging from superfluid helium [1] , liquid crystals [2] or superconductors [3] over atomic gases [4] up to astrophysics [5] . They represent topologically non-trivial solutions of nonlinear wave equations [6] and have been observed experimentally in various systems [7, 8] .\nIn recent years there has been considerable interest in studying vortex structures in ultracold atoms [9] . These systems offer several advantages compared to other physical realizations such as their tunability [10] , controllability [11] and clean experimental conditions [12] . For example, it was shown recently that one-dimensional arrays of vortices can be created in a single condensate [13] . However, most experiments so far were restricted to observing only few isolated vortices [14, 15] due to technical limitations [16] .

        "\n\nHow to Have Creative Ideas\nCreativity is something that everyone has the potential to express, no matter what their skill level is. By exposing yourself to new ideas and information, honing your craft, and activating your senses, you can increase your opportunities for creative thinking and find creative solutions to problems. With a little patience and the right techniques, you can start to uncover innovative solutions from unfamiliar territories.\n\nStart by exposing yourself to new ideas and information. Read books or watch films or shows that help to explore new concepts and information. Seek out opinions and perspectives that contradict or challenge your own thinking and beliefs. Talk to people who have different backgrounds and skillsets than your own. All these sources can help you to think outside of the box and see things from a different perspective.\n\nHave a place to record your ideas. This could be a sketchbook, a notebook, or a digital document, but wherever you decide to store them, ensure there is a space for collecting and organizing them each time an idea occurs to you. This place should be easily accessible, since sudden flashes of creativity often occur in unexpected moments and need to be noted down quickly so you don’t forget the inspiration when it strikes.\n\nLet yourself be bored. Many people are loathe to simply sit and allow their minds to wander, but this kind of idle contemplation can be extremely beneficial for creative thinking. Resist distractions and inactivity; they can help to open up new lines of thought.\n\nPlay. Activating your sense of fun and humor can not only lift your mood and stimulate different parts of your brain, it can also boost your creativity and encourage you to explore unseen possibilities. Taking a break, having a laugh, exchanging jokes with colleagues, and seeking out playful activities can help to bring a more carefree outlook to a project.\n\nGet moving. Even a minor change in position or location can help you to think creatively. Try moving your base from your office to a café, or switching chairs within the same space. Take yourself for a walk and explore a new area. You never know; a fresh environment could produce your best work ever.\n\nFinally, seek out new experiences. Creative people have a natural curiosity and are always ready to explore new sights, sounds, and places. Don’t be afraid of trying your hand at something for the first time, whether it’s a new language, visiting a new corner of town, or learning a new skill. All these elements can help to open up a different perspective on things and allow for more creative thinking. \n\nTry picking up a new skill or hobby; creative people are continuously learning. Learning a new instrument, trying out a new craft, or enrolling in an evening class can help to expand your horizons and open your mind to new possibilities. Similarly, talking to other people and asking questions about what they do can help to enrich your ways of seeing the world and open your eyes to different problem-solving solutions.\n\nYou don’t need to be surrounded by other people in order to gain unique experiences; conversations with your own imagination or imaginary companions can provide fresh ideas. Similarly, try activities such as freewriting, mind mapping, and free association, where you explore or link together ideas in a random and free-form manner when no one’s watching.\n\nAbove all, keep an open mind. Creative thinking involves observing the world with a sense of curiosity, being willing to explore the unknown, and not being afraid of making mistakes. Be alert to the creative possibilities available to you and be willing, when an opportunity presents itself, to take a leap into the unknown.

This infection is highly contagious and can be difficult to treat, particularly in individuals who are already ill. Fortunately, there are several steps you can take to prevent C-Diff infections from occurring.\n\n1. Wash Your Hands Regularly\n\nOne of the most effective ways of preventing C-Diff infections is to practice good hand hygiene. Use soap and water to wash your hands frequently, particularly after using the bathroom, touching contaminated surfaces, or caring for someone who has a diarrhea. Be sure to scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds before rinsing thoroughly, and dry your hands completely.\n\n2. Avoid Sharing Spaces and Surfaces\n\nC-Diff is highly contagious, and it can be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces and fecal matter. If someone in your home or work environment has diarrhea, avoid sharing spaces and surfaces with them as much as possible. This includes bathrooms, kitchens, and common areas.\n\n3. Do Not Depend on Anti-Diarrheal Pills\n\nWhile anti-diarrheal pills may help alleviate the symptoms of diarrhea, they do not treat the underlying infection. In fact, taking anti-diarrheal medication may cause the infection to worsen. Instead of relying on pills, it is important to take the necessary steps to eliminate the bacteria causing the infection.\n\n4. Do Not Take Antibiotics Unnecessarily\n\nAlthough antibiotics can be lifesaving in many situations, they should only be taken when necessary. Antibiotics can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in your gut, making you more susceptible to infections such as C-Diff. If you are prescribed antibiotics, be sure to finish the full course of treatment as directed by your doctor.\n\n5. Expect Special Treatment\n\nIn mild to moderate cases of C-Diff infections, doctors may prescribe a special antibiotic such as metronidazole (Flagyl), which can be taken orally or intravenously in a hospital setting. This medication works by specifically targeting the C-Diff bacteria and helping to eliminate it.\n\n6. Get Toxins Out\n\nPassing bowel movements frequently can help eliminate the toxins produced by the C-Diff bacteria. While undergoing treatment with antibiotics, you may need to pass bowel movements six, eight, ten, or more times per day to get the toxins out of your system.\n\n7. Contact Your Doctor\n\nIf you have recently taken antibiotics and develop diarrhea, contact your doctor immediately. Even if the diarrhea is mild, it is important to be monitored to prevent the development of C-Diff infections and C-Diff colitis.\n\nIn conclusion, preventing C-Diff infections require a combination of good hygiene practices, antibiotic stewardship, and prompt medical care. By following these steps, you can minimize your risk of infection and maintain optimal health.",
        "How to Settle a Decedent's Estate (USA)\n\nDealing with the loss of a loved one can be a difficult and emotional process, and settling their estate can be a daunting task. When someone dies, their estate must go through the probate process in order for their assets to be distributed to their beneficiaries. If you are the executor of the decedent's estate, it is important that you understand the necessary steps to take in order to settle the estate properly. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you through the probate process in the United States.\n\nUnderstand probate.\n\nProbate is the legal process by which a person's assets are distributed after they die. The probate process can be complex and varies from state to state, but essentially it involves validating the will (if there is one), identifying the decedent's assets and debts, paying creditors and taxes, and distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries named in the will.\n\nEstimate the size of the estate.\n\nBefore you can begin settling the estate, you will need to estimate the size of the estate. This includes identifying all of the decedent's assets, such as bank accounts, real estate, personal property, and any other assets they owned. You will also need to identify any debts they owed, such as mortgages, car loans, credit cards, and taxes.\n\nFile for a simple administration.\n\nIf the estate is relatively small and there are no complex legal issues, you may be able to file for a simple administration. This is a faster and simpler process than a full probate, and it can save time and money. Check with your state's probate court to see if you are eligible for a simple administration.\n\nUnderstand the duties of an executor.\n\nAs the executor of the estate, you have several important duties. These include identifying the assets and debts of the estate, paying creditors and taxes, distributing assets to beneficiaries, and communicating with the probate court throughout the process.\n\nCheck if you are eligible.\n\nIn order to serve as the executor of an estate, you must be legally eligible. Typically, this means that you must be at least 18 years old, of sound mind, and not have any felony convictions.\n\nRequest appointment.\n\nIf you are eligible to serve as executor, you will need to request appointment from the probate court. This involves completing a form and submitting it to the court. You may also need to pay a fee.\n\nComplete the form.\n\nThe form you need to complete will vary depending on your state and the type of probate being used. Be sure to fill out the form completely and accurately, and provide all necessary information.\n\nPresent a copy of the application to the probate court.\n\nOnce you have completed the form, you will need to present a copy of the application to the probate court. You may also be required to notify any other beneficiaries or interested parties of the application.\n\nObtain a surety bond, if required.\n\nIn some states, you may be required to obtain a surety bond in order to be appointed as executor. This bond helps to protect the beneficiaries in case you fail to fulfill your duties properly.\n\nAttend the appointment hearing.\n\nOnce you have submitted your application, you will need to attend an appointment hearing. This is where the probate court will review your application and decide whether to appoint you as executor.\n\nGet the “Letters of Administration.”\n\nOnce you have been appointed as executor, you will receive \"Letters of Administration\" or \"Letters Testamentary\" from the probate court. These letters give you the legal authority to act on behalf of the estate.\n\nFind the will.\n\nIf there is a will, you will need to locate it. This document will outline the decedent's wishes for the distribution of their assets.\n\nOrder a copy of the death certificate.\n\nYou will need a copy of the decedent's death certificate in order to settle their estate.\n\nHire an attorney.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you hire an attorney to help you through the probate process. An attorney can make sure that you are fulfilling your duties properly and can help you navigate any complex legal issues that may arise.\n\nHire an accountant.\n\nYou may also need to hire an accountant to help you with the financial aspects of settling the estate. An accountant can help you identify assets, pay taxes, and manage the estate's finances.\n\nHire a financial planner.\n\nIf the estate is large or involves complex assets, you may want to hire a financial planner to help you manage and distribute the assets properly.\n\nProve that the will is valid.\n\nIf there is a will, you will need to prove that it is valid before you can settle the estate. This involves providing evidence that the decedent was of sound mind when they created the will and that the will was executed properly.\n\nPresent other evidence of the will’s validity.\n\nIf there are any disputes or challenges to the validity of the will, you may need to present additional evidence to the probate court to prove that it is valid.\n\nCollect the estate property.\n\nOnce the will has been validated and the assets have been identified, you will need to collect the estate property.\n\nAppraise the estate.\n\nYou may need to have the estate appraised in order to determine the value of the assets.\n\nCreate an inventory of all estate property.\n\nOnce you have appraised the estate, you will need to create an inventory of all of the estate property.\n\nDetermine which beneficiaries will get specific assets.\n\nYou will need to distribute the estate property to the beneficiaries named in the will.\n\nOpen an estate bank account.\n\nIn order to manage the estate's finances, you will need to open a separate bank account for the estate.\n\nContact the decedent’s creditors.\n\nYou will need to contact the decedent's creditors in order to pay any debts owed by the estate.\n\nContact people who owed the decedent money.\n\nIf the decedent had any outstanding debts owed to them, you will need to contact those individuals to collect the money owed.\n\nInform the Social Security Administration (SSA).\n\nYou will need to inform the Social Security Administration of the decedent's death and any benefits they may have been receiving.\n\nClose financial accounts.\n\nYou will need to close any financial accounts owned by the decedent, such as bank accounts, credit cards, and investment accounts.\n\nPay taxes.\n\nYou will need to file the decedent's final income tax return and may need to file estate tax returns as well.\n\nPay bills.\n\nYou will need to pay any outstanding bills owed by the estate, such as utility bills, property taxes, and any other debts.\n\nDetermine which beneficiaries will get specific assets.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you will need to distribute the estate property to the beneficiaries named in the will.\n\nLiquidate remaining estate property.\n\nIf there is any remaining estate property that cannot be distributed to the beneficiaries, you will need to liquidate it and distribute the proceeds.\n\nDeliver property to beneficiaries.\n\nOnce you have distributed all of the estate property, you will need to deliver it to the beneficiaries.\n\nGet paid.\n\nAs the executor of the estate, you may be entitled to payment for your services. Be sure to check with your state's probate court to see what the rules are regarding executor fees.\n\nClose the estate.\n\nOnce you have completed all of the necessary tasks and distributed the estate property, you can close the estate.\n\nIn conclusion, settling a decedent's estate can be a complex and time-consuming process. It is important that you understand the necessary steps to take in order to settle the estate properly. By following the steps outlined in this article and seeking help from professionals when needed, you can ensure that the estate is settled properly and the decedent's wishes are fulfilled.",

Potassium-calcium phosphate based optical amplifiers have been recently introduced as a cost-effective alternative to Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers. In this paper, the optical properties of Er3+ doped KCa3(PO4)2 glasses, which are promising candidates for the realization of low-cost optical amplifiers, are presented. Transmittance, luminescence and photoluminescence spectra, radiative and non-radiative lifetimes of KCa3(PO4)2 : Er3+ samples are measured in the wavelength range from 200 nm to 1000 nm. A detailed study of temperature dependence of spectroscopic characteristics of Er3+ ions is also presented. The obtained results can be useful for the tailoring of Er3+ doped KCa3(PO4)2 glasses for specific optical amplifiers applications.",
        "The properties of the lightest hadrons are among the least comprehended aspects of particle physics. One important characteristic of the pion, the lightest hadron, is its radius.

        "In 1728, the British scientist Sir Isaac Newton built the first operational clock that could measure time with great precision. By comparing the time it took for pulses of light from a lantern to travel to different distances, he was the first to be able to measure the speed of light in a concrete, empirical way. In 1727, he had already postulated that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation, and that it travelled at a finite speed. However, to test this hypothesis, he needed to find an object that would both emit and receive light simultaneously from the same spot. In a clever move, he set up two vertical tubes, with a mirror at the bottom of the longer tube, so that a light sent from the top of the shorter tube would bounce off the mirror and travel down the longer tube. Because the light and the mirror were both at the same height, they would be in sync, and by measuring the time it took for a pulse of light to travel from one end of the tube to the other, he could measure the speed of light in both directions. As it turned out, the speed of light was constant and remained the fastest speed possible for any object in the universe. This empirical discovery earned Isaac Newton the title of being the \"father of modern science\" and ushering in the era of experimental science.",
        "\nWe present photospheric observations of the magnetic polarity of two photospheric lines in the single spectrum of the quiet Sun. The observations were made with the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation spectrometer on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. The motivation for our research was the inference of the polarity of magnetic features in the photosphere from the observation of opposite polarity in the Corona, as has been reported by previous observations with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Our key idea was to use the high spatial resolution of the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation spectrometer to obtain information on the magnetic polarity of small-scale features in the photosphere. Our methodology was to compare the peak intensity of the photospheric lines in the spectrum of a small area of the photosphere with the integrated intensity of the photospheric lines in the spectrum of a large area of the photosphere. The results of our research are that we were able to infer the magnetic polarity of two photospheric lines in the single spectrum of the quiet Sun, and that the inferred magnetic polarity was in agreement with the polarity of large-scale features in the photosphere, as has been reported by other observations. We have been able to resolve a problem that has been discussed in the context of solar physics: the problem of determining the magnetic polarity of small-scale features in the photosphere. The practical application of our findings is that we can use the knowledge of the magnetic polarity of small-scale features in the photosphere to obtain further information on the structure and evolution of the solar corona. The theoretical application of our findings is that we can use the knowledge of the magnetic polarity of small-scale features in the photosphere to obtain further information on the magnetic structure of the solar interior.",

        "\n\nFostering a child is one of the most noble acts of kindness one can do - that of offering a safe haven to a child who may not have ever experienced what a real home feels like. As a foster parent, you'll be a part of rebuilding a loving family for the child, nurturing and guiding their growth emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually. While it may not be easy, it is essential to approach fostering with respect in order to give the child a safe and nurturing environment from which to heal. Here are some tips on how to foster parent with respect. \n\nLet friends and family know, in advance, that you are welcoming a new child into your family and that you expect them to treat them equally. This will help ensure that, while your foster child is adjusting to life in their new family, they will not feel their presence is unwelcome. Make it clear that your foster child is an important member of the family and should be respected and treated the same as any other family members.\n\nTreat them equally and provide the same incentives. All children thrive on security, consistency, and fairness. If you reward other children in your family for good behavior, be sure to do the same with your foster child. If you don’t have enough incentives to give to your foster child, talk to your child's best interest worker and ask if there are any resources available.\n\nLet them know that their parents loved them to the best of their ability. Even if this isn’t necessarily true, it is important for the child to know that their parents did love them as best as they could—as this will be a source of comfort in difficult times. The child should also know that it was not their fault if they were put into foster care and that a loving home is now available for them.\n\nAct as if you made a choice to support them by providing a safe and loving home. While it is difficult to accept that a child has been through a situation where they weren’t wanted or supported, it is important to make it clear to the child that you are Choosing Them and you are all part of a team. This will provide the child with a sense of stability and assurance.\n\nLet them know that they are normal, and that you will have normal expectations and consequences for them. While the child may have experienced trauma or instability in their past, it is important to reiterate that they are a normal child deserving of being held accountable just like any other child in the family. Explain to them that, while you understand there may be behaviors coming from the past that the child needs help learning how to control, they should expect normal and fair disciplinary actions as well as rewards for meeting behavior expectations.\n\nTeach them life skills. In addition to providing emotional, intellectual, and spiritual support, it is important to provide your foster child with the life skills necessary to be independent and successful. This could range from teaching a child how to manage money to teaching them how to handle large or difficult emotions—it is important to ensure that the child knows they have the tools and skills necessary to confidently tackle any situation they may face in adulthood.\n\nDon’t ask them to step out of family pictures. This can be very alienating for your child, so instead make sure to include them in all family pictures if they choose to participate. This will tell them that they belong and that the family loves them regardless of where they come from.\n\nDon’t buy your “real” kids expensive gifts for birthdays and holidays and give generic and insulting gifts to your foster children. This is extremely damaging and sends a message to your foster child that they aren’t considered a full family member. Instead, be sure to give them thoughtful and special gifts in line with what you give to the other children in your family.\n\nBecome a foster parent because you realize that a foster child is in desperate need of food, clothing, shelter, as well as love, consistency, expectations, and to be treated fairly! Most often, foster children have gone through extremely traumatic experiences that require tremendous amounts of love, patience, and understanding. Nurturing and re-instilling faith in love, responsibility, and consistency is a challenging but worthwhile endeavor.\n\nGive your foster child time to transition, bond, and trust without taking their pain, tragedy, and mistrust personally. It is important to remember that this is a significant period of adjustment and transition for the child, and it is very likely that they will have difficulty trusting your intentions and feeling secure in their new home. Be patient and understanding with the process and make sure the child knows that they are loved and accepted.\n\nDon’t expect perfection from yourself. Parenting is a lifelong journey, and no foster parent is expected to be perfect. Know your limits and seek help when you need it. Foster parenting can be difficult, but it can also be extremely rewarding and provide the child with a sense of safety, security, and familial support.\n\nDon’t underestimate the intelligence and raw emotion hiding in your foster child. Showing them support and understanding is vital to helping them heal from trauma. Be conscious of non-verbal communication and avoid demanding immediate trust. Evidence that your foster child is growing emotionally will emerge at his or her own pace.\n\nFostering a child may not be an easy task, but it’s an honorable one. By approaching it with respect, you are helping to provide a home filled with love, security, and support to a child who needs it most.",

        "A new type of thermodynamic cycle has been proposed, which violates the First Law of Thermodynamics but satisfies the Second Law. The new cycle is comprised of two isenthalpic processes, where the total volume entropy increases, and it connects two states with different temperatures but equal volume. The first process is isothermal compression with external heating; the second process is isothermal expansion with external cooling. Based on the generalized Clausius–Duhem inequality, we prove that the total volume entropy increases in both processes. Thus, this cycle may generate work. In addition, we demonstrate that this cycle is equivalent to the Carnot cycle with a demon. Thus, the total volume entropy increase implies the violation of the First Law. At the same time, the Second Law is satisfied because the total entropy increases in both processes. Hence, this cycle might have some potentials in industrial applications. This is an original paper and was published on 12 January 2023 with the URL https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11651.pdf. Since the late 18th century, the First Law of Thermodynamics has been well established, stating that the entropy of isolated systems cannot decrease over time. However, there are still some aspects that need to be further explored. The aim of this paper is to propose a new thermodynamic cycle that violates the First Law, but satisfies the Second Law. The new cycle is comprised of two isenthalpic processes, where the total volume entropy increases, and it connects two states with different temperatures but equal volume. The first process is isothermal compression with external heating; the second process is isothermal expansion with external cooling. Based on the generalized Clausius–Duhem inequality, we prove that the total volume entropy increases in both processes. Thus, this cycle may generate work. In addition, we demonstrate that this cycle is equivalent to the Carnot cycle with a demon. Thus, the total volume entropy increase implies the violation of the First Law. At the same time, the Second Law is satisfied because the total entropy increases in both processes. Hence, this cycle might have some potentials in industrial applications. Keywords: Thermodynamics, Entropy, Second Law of Thermodynamics, Violation of the First Law, Proposed Cycle 1. INTRODUCTION The First Law of Thermodynamics states that the total energy of isolated systems is constant in time, where the energy is the product of the system’s temperature and volume. Since the late 18th century, a well-established fact is that the entropy of isolated systems cannot decrease over time. Thus, the Second Law of Thermodynamics was established, which states that the entropy of isolated systems always increases. These two laws are fundamental principles in thermodynamics and have been verified to a high degree of accuracy, which has led to the wide use of the terminology “Thermodynamics”. In recent years, some researchers have proposed thermodynamic cycles that violate the First Law but satisfy the",
        "\nIn this research project, deep and wide-field observations of ten galaxy clusters with a range of mass, morphology, redshift, and density were made in two bands at the one meter Swope and 2.5 meter du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Special attention was paid to the correction of illumination, subtraction from the background, point spread function determination, and subtracting galaxies. The intracluster light (ICL) flux was distinguishable in both bands for all ten clusters, with luminosities between 7.6 x 10^{10} to 7.0 x 10^{11} h^{-1} solar luminosities in r band and 1.4 x 10^{10} to 1.2 x 10^{11} h^{-1} solar luminosities in the B-band. This range of flux accounted for 6 to 22% of the total light within one quarter of the virial radius in r band, and 4 to 21% in the B-band. On average, colors in ICL ranged from 1.5 to 2.8 magnitudes after k-corrections and evolution corrections had been applied. Moreover, ICL presence was also detected in groups around the cluster center and was detected up to a distance of ~1 h^{-1} Mpc from the cluster center. The sample of the Abell clusters utilized in the study is incomplete, making it difficult to interpret correlations between the ICL flux and cluster properties. Nonetheless, a correlation between centrally distributed ICL profiles and the presence of cD galaxies was noted, suggesting that ICL may have formed either from galaxy interactions at the center or from early group formation, followed by merging in the middle.",
        "In this paper we show that the presence of a fundamental string in AdS3 requires the string to have an infinite energy. The proof is based on an observation that fundamental strings in AdS3 arise as solutions to the classical equations of motion of the corresponding superstring compactified on a circle of small radius. We argue that the spectrum of string states that are trivial under this compactification must be bounded from below in order to maintain finiteness of the string energy. We derive an inequality that string states must satisfy in AdS3, which we call the Hagedorn condition. We show that the Hagedorn condition is equivalent to the requirement that the string energy be infinite, and we provide evidence that this condition is also necessary. Our results imply that fundamental strings in AdS3 are therefore ghostlike. We also discuss an application of our results to the correspondence principle in AdS3, and we conclude by summarizing some of the key ideas in our paper.",

        "When I move my head from side to side, it feels like different muscles are working. It's like when I keep my head still and move my eyes, there's a tingly feeling and sort of a little muscle wobble in my eyes. But when I move my head, it's like my whole face is feeling something.\n\nThe eyes and head work differently, even though they're both moving. Even if we look at the same spot, moving my eyes or my head can't really be done using the same muscles. \n\nIf my head is still, the muscles inside my eyes move to get my eyes to look different directions. When my head moves, a different group of muscles called the neck muscles move to get my head to move from side to side. \n\nMy eyes are pretty powerful actually. They can move real fast, but I guess the head doesn't move that rapidly so that's why it feels different.\n\nI think my eyes and head use the same kind of muscles that help the eyes focus but not the same muscles that move them from side to side. \n\nMy eyes are pretty amazing, because even when my head moves and everything else is shaking, like when I'm running, my eyes can still stay focused on something. I guess that's why astronauts wear special helmets, because their eyes can stay in one place and keep their head, neck and whole body in the right position while they go into space.",
        "Hermann Göring, a prominent German military leader and politician during the Third Reich, was one of the high-ranking Nazis captured by the Allied forces at the end of World War II. He was eventually sentenced to death for his role in the war crimes committed by the Nazi regime. On October 15, 1946, the day before he was scheduled to be executed, Göring committed suicide in his cell by ingesting cyanide. The question remains, how was he able to get access to cyanide while in prison?\n\nThere are several theories about how Göring was able to obtain the poison. Some suggest that he smuggled a capsule of cyanide into prison with him, possibly hidden in his clothing or in his personal belongings. Others speculate that he was able to obtain the poison from prison staff or other inmates who had access to it through covert means.\n\nOne popular theory is that Göring was able to obtain the cyanide from a sympathetic prison guard who smuggled it to him in exchange for money. This theory is supported by eyewitness accounts of Göring's behavior in the days leading up to his suicide. According to reports, Göring was seen in high spirits and had been making plans for the future, which suggests that he had obtained the means of ending his life.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Göring was a highly influential and charismatic figure with connections to many people in positions of power. It is possible that he was able to use these connections to obtain the cyanide, either through bribery or coercion.\n\nRegardless of how he obtained the poison, Göring's suicide remains a controversial topic to this day. Some see it as an act of cowardice, while others view it as a final act of defiance against his captors. In any case, the mystery of how he was able to obtain the cyanide will likely never be fully solved.",
        " Hopeless Romantic is the sixth full-length studio album by American punk rock band The Bouncing Souls. It was released on July 11, 2000 through Epitaph Records. The album's opening track, \"Hopeless Romantic\", was highly successful and increased the band's popularity. Other singles such as \"Lean on Sheena\", \"Kid\", and \"The Something Special\" were also released, and the album was promoted with a tour of the same name. The band decided to stretch musically by using a wide range of instrumentation and production techniques that had not been heard on their previous albums. This included the use of piano, organs, horns, strings, and choirs. The use of such instruments was also augmented by a number of guest musicians and vocalists, most notably Matthew Reich from the band, Solea. Lyrically, the album explored themes of hopes and desires, romantic relationships, and small-town life. The album is largely seen as a sign of the band's maturity and expansive artistic growth. The album artwork, which was created by Jason Gondek, is composed of a central figure surrounded by surreal imagery. The figure is a skeletal character depicted in several different poses, all forming a larger image. The Bouncing Souls promoted Hopeless Romantic with a tour of the same name which began in June 2000. The band performed in various locations around the United States, Canada, and Europe. They opened up for other punk rock bands such as Less Than Jake and Hot Water Music. In the years following its release, Hopeless Romantic has developed a cult following. It has been dubbed as one of The Bouncing Souls' best albums and is often hailed as an important contribution to punk rock.",
        "Transgenderism is not a mental disease. People who are transgender have a different gender identity than what was assigned to them at birth. It's a way of expressing their unique identity that can't be confined by the gender options people are typically given.\n\nA mental disease is something that has to do with a person's mental state. It affects the way they think, feel, and act. It often makes them have difficulty in their daily lives. Transgenderism doesn't cause any of these kinds of problems.\n\nTransgenderism is different from a mental disease because it has nothing to do with how a person's brain works. It is not a illness or disorder, but rather a way for people to identify and express their true selves regardless of their assigned gender. Transgender people can still think and feel the same as everyone else, but may choose to express themselves differently.\n\nTransgenderism has been around for a long time, even before societies began talking about it more openly. It is normal to feel like your gender identity isn't what it was assigned at birth and to embrace the perceived gender you feel more comfortable with. Society has begun to recognize this as something normal and no longer view it as a mental disorder.\n\nTransgenderism is also different from a mental disorder in that it doesn't affect someone's mental health. People who are transgender experience a similar range of emotions, thoughts, and activities that any other person does. It does not produce depression, anxiety, or other mental illnesses that can drastically affect someone's life and relationships.\n\nTransgenderism isn't a mental disease and it's becoming more widely accepted in society. People are recognizing how hard it can be for transgender people to go through life feeling like they can't express their true selves, and more people are working to make sure they have the support they need to live happy and fulfilling lives.",
        "We present here a study that focuses on extending the redshift-distance relation in Cosmological General Relativity to higher redshifts, thus enabling the estimation of distances of distant objects in the universe. Our study aims to address the problem of finding solutions for current theoretical problems in cosmology by refining and adding new insights to the existing model of Cosmological General Relativity. The key ideas of our study revolve around the cosmological principle, which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, and the validity of the General Theory of Relativity in cosmology. \n\nOur methodology involves using distance measurements from supernovae and quasars, which we use to determine the redshift-distance relation to higher redshifts. We model the observed luminosity distances as a function of redshift and derive an accurate estimate of the Hubble parameter. We also factor in the effects of gravitational lensing, which distorts the light coming from distant galaxies. \n\nOur results demonstrate that extending the redshift-distance relation to higher redshifts is valid, and it allows us to derive precise estimates of the cosmological parameters. We are confident that our study provides a solid framework for further investigations into the nature of dark energy, and it will contribute significantly to our understanding of the universe's evolution and structure. This study opens new avenues for researchers to explore by refining the Cosmological General Relativity model to explain the observed large-scale behavior of the universe.",

        "\n\nHow to Improve School Spirit\nWhen it comes to school spirit, there are lots of ways to make sure your school stands proud and shows its colors. Whether it’s organizing pep rallies or encouraging the students to dress up in their school colors, there are lots of strategies you can use to spread school spirit. It takes only a few basic efforts to become a leader and get the school spirit going. Here are some tips to help you get your school spirit up and running:\n\nWear colors. The easiest way to show that you have school spirit is to wear your school’s colors. Whether it’s a jersey, shirt, hat, or even face paint, wearing your school colors will help show your fellow students, teachers, and staff that you’re proud of your school and its accomplishments.\n\nMake fun things that show your spirit. Making clay statues, ribbons, sandwiches, and other items that support your school can really show your school spirit. You can sell them to the students, parents, staff, and even alumni. The profit can be used to benefit your school’s various programs.\n\nBe your school’s mascot. Every school can use a mascot, whether for games, pep rallies, parades, or any other special event. Most high schools prefer a person to dress up in a mascot costume so you can often find opportunities to volunteer if you have the energy and enthusiasm for it.\n\nSing your school’s alma mater or fight song. Knowing the words to your school’s song shows that you’ve taken the time to memorize something about your school and it better connects you to the school. This also shows your school spirit during pep rallies, games, and other school events.\n\nAttend games and other events. Showing up is the first step in showing your school spirit. Whether it’s a game, play, pep rally, or other school functions, showing up to support your team’s cause is a great way of cheering them on and displaying your school spirit.\n\nGet involved in extracurriculars. Whether it’s a sport, academic competition or a club, getting involved in extracurriculars at your school is a great way to show your school spirit. It shows that you’re proud to be part of the school and it helps you meet other students and fellow alums.\n\nJoin or start a club. If there isn’t already a club on campus that focuses on improving school spirit, start one and get all your friends involved. You can create signs, murals, and tons of other activities to support the clubs purpose and draw attention from the school and community.\n\nGet people to participate. In order for your efforts to be effective, more people need to get involved. Put up posters and hand out flyers around the school, announce the activities over the PA system, and talk to your friends and classmates about it. By getting the word out, more people will join in and will help get the momentum going.\n\nTry fundraising. Have a bake sale, car wash, or other activity that allows students to raise money for the school. This helps with the school’s bottom line and will strengthen your school spirit.\n\nEncourage traditions. There are lots of fun traditions people can participate in to show school spirit. Everything from chair painting, rivalry chants, or a school spirit week can all help increase school spirit.\n\nMake sure that there are lots of energizing activities planned. Picking appropriate and fun activities for pep rallies or other school functions will help ensure that everyone has a great time and that school spirit will be visible.\n\nHave door prizes. Giving the students a reason to keep attending the events will make sure there is plenty of involvement. Pick items that are related to the school, such as t-shirts, mugs, or anything else to show school spirit.\n\nGive away random seat prizes. This will give the students something to look forward to each time and helps break up the monotony of the events.\n\nStart a Rowdy Rooter's group. Working with a group of dedicated students that is focused solely on the purpose of promoting school spirit is a great idea. They can be the leaders before, after, and during games or school events.\n\nHave a Master of Ceremonies (MC). The MC can be responsible for leading the school cheer, announcing updates, and other things to keep everyone involved and excited.\n\nGet faculty to be cheerleaders. It’s always nice to see educators and administrators taking part in the events and it adds a great source of motivation for students.\n\nGet the school mascot to participate. This can help to add energy to the events and help promote school spirit.\n\nConsider throwing a pep rally with a theme. This gives everyone something to get into and adds a bit of a competitive air to the events.\n\nAsk school officials to help. If you go to your school officials and ask them to help you improve school spirit, they will be thrilled. You can ask for help with activities around the school, planning strategies, and more.\n\nTalk to your teachers about ways to work school spirit into lesson plans. Working school spirit into lesson plans can be very inspiring to the students and can add an extra dimension to the learning process.\n\nAsk parents and the community to help encourage school spirit. Parents and the community can provide extra support for games and events that may not be covered otherwise. The more community involvement the better the school spirit will be.\n\nSo, there are lots of ways to show school spirit and by getting everyone involved, you can keep school spirit alive in your school and all of its students and faculty. It’s all about being creative and finding ways to keep the spirit alive. Good luck!",

        "In this work, we explore a new methodology for modeling heterogeneous materials via two-point correlation functions. The problem we attempt to solve is the difficulty of accurately characterizing complex materials with varying microstructures. Traditional methods such as finite element analysis often require significant computational resources and may not capture the full range of microstructural features. Our approach relies on the statistical analysis of material properties, as described by two-point correlation functions. These functions quantify the probability that two points in a material are of the same phase, allowing us to build realistic microstructural models that generate accurate material properties.\n\nTo implement this methodology, we begin with a review of the basic principles of two-point correlation functions. We provide a thorough explanation of the mathematical foundation behind these functions, as well as their significance in characterizing complex materials. Next, we apply the methodology to a set of heterogeneous materials, utilizing computational simulations to evaluate the accuracy of our developed models. Our results demonstrate the significant potential of two-point correlation functions in modeling complex materials. The methodology presented in this work will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in various fields, including materials science, engineering, and physics.",
        "Canım Hoca Mehmed Pasha was an influential Ottoman statesman and military commander who played a significant role during the 17th century in shaping the empire's trajectory. He was born in the year 1585 in Istanbul, Turkey, and belonged to a wealthy family of notable scholars. Mehmed Pasha was a prolific writer, and his works were highly regarded during his time. He was a student of astronomy, mathematics, and Islamic jurisprudence. His works covered a wide range of topics, including religious practices, the habits of birds, the benefits of honey and almonds, and the classification of animals. In 1620, Mehmed Pasha was appointed as the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, a role he held for three years. During his tenure, he introduced significant reforms that helped improve the economy of the empire. He implemented policies that supported agriculture, encouraged trade, and reduced taxes on merchants. His military campaigns were also successful, and he defeated the Safavid Empire in a war, which lasted for three years. He then went on to invade the Kingdom of Poland, which was considered a significant military threat to the Ottoman Empire. Despite facing difficult challenges during the invasion, Canım Hoca Mehmed Pasha was able to achieve a significant victory. Mehmed Pasha was known for his liberal and open-minded approach to religion and culture. He was tolerant of different religious beliefs and supported the arts, especially literature. He was also a patron of science, and his library was considered one of the largest in Istanbul. In conclusion, Canım Hoca Mehmed Pasha remains a significant figure in Ottoman history. He was an accomplished statesman, writer, and military commander who left an indelible mark on the empire. He died in 1640 in Istanbul at the age of 55.",
        "Near-data processing is an open problem in machine learning that needs to be solved to take full advantage of all the big data generated by sensors and IoT devices. This work describes a method for efficiently processing near-data, i.e. data that is generated close to the point of production, with deep learning methods that usually require large amounts of data that is globally distributed. The proposed method uses machine generated virtual near-data to train deep neural networks. First, the method presents the concept of near-data and its requirements, and then it describes how it uses virtualization andDeepfake to generate virtual near-data. Next, the method presents the proposed method for training neural networks with virtual near-data. Finally, the paper includes an experimental section that shows the efficiency of the method using real-life datasets. I think this paper is well-written and has a good contribution to the deep learning community, however, I have some concerns about the proofs of the concept, in particular about using Deepfake to generate virtual near-data. I don't see any reference to previous works that use Deepfake to generate virtual data, so I'm not sure that this approach is novel. In addition, the Deepfake platform is banned in many countries and a potential copyright holder could easily claim that the paper infringes their rights. I would recommend that the paper include a sentence to that effect. My main concerns are about the proof of concept of using Deepfake to generate virtual near-data. I don't see any previous work that uses Deepfake to generate virtual near-data. I don't think this is a novel approach, and I'm not sure that the paper presents a novel approach. In addition, the Deepfake platform is banned in many countries and a potential copyright holder could easily claim that the paper infringes their rights.",

We use these data together with published FIR/submillimeter measurements to derive dust masses using two different methods. The first method uses the observed fluxes at 250, 350, 500, 850, 1100, 1300, 1600, 2400, and 3000 microns along with an assumed temperature distribution to calculate the total dust mass. In the second method we fit modified blackbody functions to each galaxy's SEDs individually and then integrate over all wavelengths longer than 100 microns to determine their total dust masses. For both methods we assume that the dust is optically thin throughout our wavelength range.  Using the derived dust masses and gas masses determined by previous studies we find that there are no significant differences in the dust-to-gas ratio as a function of IR luminosity or morphological type within this sample.",

        "This paper studies neural techniques for end-to-end computational argumentation mining. The starting point is a syntax treebank for argumentation text. We frame AM both as dependency parsing and as a tagging problem. Contrary to models that operate on argument component level, we find that dependency parsing leads to subpar performance results. In contrast, less complex (local) tagging models based on BiLSTMs perform robustly across classification scenarios, being able to catch long-range dependencies inherent to the AM problem. Moreover, we find that jointly learning subtasks, in a multi-task learning setup, improves performance. Overall, this paper studies some novel and promising directions for future research on neural argumentation mining. We feel that this is an area that is just now beginning to take advantage of the latest developments in deep neural networks, and look forward to future improvements in this area. We would like to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments! Here is an excerpt of comments from one of the reviewers: \"I really enjoyed this paper and find the topic to be of great interest. My only suggestion is to make the read more like an essay -- digress from the standard scientific formality of a paper a bit more to make a compelling argument for why the field of argumentation mining should care about these latest developments in deep learning. Some examples are: 1) mention how this is going to allow argumentation mining to be used in important real-world applications (i.e. applied to twitter discussions about COVID19 to track spread and/or rebuttals); 2) If you are going to compare your system to distant alternatives, also explain why those alternatives are problematic; 3) Place this work in a broader context of advances in NLP since the last major AM conference (iem) was held; 4) briefly discuss what one needs to build an end-to-end system for argumentation mining (parser, tagger, cosine similarity, etc. -- this is a popular tech demo these days) and then offer demo code to that readers. I really think this is an area that is going to grow tremendously in the near future and I think you've got some really interesting ideas that will play an important role in the field. Good luck in your future work.\" The above-mentioned points have been included in the revised version of this paper.

In 2007 it was one of the first schools in the UK to be awarded a third specialism in Business and Enterprise. The school's sixth form has been consistently one of the highest performing in the country. In 2007 it was the top performing school in the Wirral with 99% of students achieving 5 A* to C grades at GCSE including English and Maths. The school was last inspected by Ofsted in June 2006 and was graded as Outstanding. The school has been awarded the title of High Performing Specialist School and in the last three years has been in the top 100 schools in the country for the number of students achieving the top grades at A Level. The school was founded in 1895 as Wallasey High School for Girls. It opened in 1897 in a large house at 6 Yorke Road, New Brighton. In 1898, it moved to a new building on the same site, which was designed by the local architect, Percy Richard Partnership. In 1964, the school moved to its present site at Bebington. In September 2013, the school celebrated its 120th anniversary. A time line of the school's history was on display in the school's reception to celebrate the occasion. The school has a number of traditions including the annual Speech Day, which is held at the end of the summer term. For many years, the event was held at the Floral Pavilion in New Brighton, but in recent times it has been held at the school. In 2006, the school celebrated the 400th anniversary of the birth of one of its most famous old girls, the diarist, Katherine Jane Pitt. A blue plaque was unveiled at her former home in New Brighton to commemorate the event. In 2011, the school's 125th anniversary was celebrated with a reunion for old girls. A book, \"The Wirral Grammar School for Girls – A Celebration of 125 Years\" was published to commemorate the occasion. In 2013, the school's Prep Department celebrated its 40th anniversary.

        "\nThis article investigates the characteristics of transition objects (objects consisting of both an optically thin inner disc surrounded by an optically thick outer disc) and their associated disc masses (Mdisc) and stellar accretion rates (Mdot). We examine the demographic differences between accreting T Tauri stars with the same age, compared to the transition objects. We observe that transition objects possess a significantly lower Mdot at the same Mdisc, with a median Mdisc being 4 times greater than those of non-transition single stars in Taurus. These demographics may support theories of planet formation and disc accretion. An analysis of the Mdot-Mdisc plane suggests that transition objects form a distinct demographic group, which, when separated out, leads to a close relationship between Mdisc and Mdot with a slope close to the value of one anticipated in simple disc accretion theories.",
        "It was more successful in producing offspring that survived and reproduced themselves successfully than those produced by asexual reproduction methods. It is also possible to speculate on how sexual reproduction evolved from asexual reproduction.  Sexual reproduction may have been selected because it produces genetically diverse offspring which increases their chances of survival when faced with environmental changes or new competitors.   A sexually reproducing population can adapt faster if one sex becomes less fit due to genetic mutations (evolution) while another remains unchanged.    The first step towards sexual reproduction would be random mating between individuals within each generation followed by recombination through meiosis where genes are shuffled around randomly during gamete formation. This process creates variation among offspring as well as increasing fitness overall. Random mating between individuals within generations followed by recombination through meosis created variation among offspring as well increased fitness overall. First step toward sexual reproduction would be random mating between individuals within each generation",

        "Dogs are social animals, and they crave interaction with other dogs. However, as long as they receive enough attention, exercise, and mental stimulation from their human companions, they can be perfectly content living without other dogs. That being said, it’s important to note that every dog is different and has different social needs and preferences. Some dogs may not need as much social interaction with other dogs, while others may become depressed or anxious without it.\n\nTo prevent loneliness in dogs that do not have access to other canine companions, it’s essential to ensure that they receive adequate attention, exercise, and mental stimulation. Attention can be provided through regular playtime, cuddles, and training sessions. Exercise is crucial for a dog’s physical and mental health, so daily walks or runs and outdoor activities like hiking or swimming can fulfill this need. Mental stimulation can be provided through puzzle toys, training, and games.\n\nIf a dog owner notices their dog appears anxious or unhappy despite providing adequate attention, exercise, and mental stimulation, it may be time to consider adding another dog to the family. Introducing a new canine companion can help provide social interaction and companionship that dogs crave. However, it’s essential to introduce new dogs slowly and carefully to ensure the dogs are compatible and happy with each other's company.",

        "\n\nWe present here results of a systematic study of the interaction of the supernova remnant (SNR) G18.8+0.3 with molecular clouds. We have searched for radio sources in the region of the SNR with the Australia Telescope and have found a jet in the northern part of the remnant. We have also observed the region in X-ray with the Chandra Observatory and have found that the gas in the remnant is mainly in the form of a toroid with a hot inner rim and a cold outer rim. These two observations together provide strong evidence that the toroidal gas is the result of the interaction of the supernova with a molecular cloud. The strength of the interaction has been such that much of the molecular cloud has been compressed to form hot gas, but a part of the cloud has survived the interaction and has been partly ionized by the supernova. We have developed a model in which the toroidal gas is formed by the superposition of the initially radial shocked gas and the non-shocked molecular cloud. This model successfully reproduces many of the properties of the toroidal gas. We also discuss the effects of the interaction on the remnant itself.",

        "The Ottoman Empire was undoubtedly one of the most powerful states in the world during the 16th century, controlling vast territories and establishing an impressive military presence across Europe, Asia, and Africa. However, during the subsequent three centuries, the empire experienced a significant decline, earning itself the reputation of the \"sick man of Europe.\" So, what happened and what went wrong?\n\nFirstly, the Ottoman Empire's economic woes began in the 17th century due to a combination of factors. One of the primary reasons was the decline of trade with the Western European powers, which sapped the empire's prosperity. Additionally, the Ottoman Empire had a centralized economic system that failed to keep pace with the global economic advancements and lacked the dynamism necessary to remain competitive. Also, the massive military expenditure that had once fueled the empire's success eventually became a strain on its resources, leading to a significant imbalance between policy, administration, and taxation.\n\nAnother significant challenge the Ottoman Empire faced was the rise of European powers, which competed for dominance in the region. European countries like France, Britain, and Austria often challenged the Ottoman Empire with trade, political influence, and territorial expansions. Due to the continuous onslaughts from the European superpowers, the Ottoman Empire gradually lost its access to resources and technological advancements, making it difficult for it to maintain a military force capable of fending off these challenges.\n\nPolitical instability was also a significant factor contributing to the Ottoman Empire's decline. In the latter years, many weak sultans were on the throne, which led to poor governance and corruption within the empire. Additionally, the Ottoman Empire, which was once a model Islamic state, experienced a significant decline in religious tolerance. As a result of the intolerance, the empire's non-Muslim population often faced systematic persecution and oppression, which further destabilized the empire.\n\nIn conclusion, the Ottoman Empire's decline was the result of various factors, including economic decline, western expansion, poor governance, and religious intolerance. Ultimately, the once-powerful Ottoman Empire found itself unable to keep pace with modern times and was stuck in a state of stagnation that eventually led to its collapse.",

        "\n\nWe propose a new type of continuum theory which is based on the assumptions that the material is homogeneous and isotropic, and that the body has a low dimension. As an application, we consider the problem of the stability of a nano-rod to elastic deformations. We show that the standard continuum theory, which is applicable to an infinite dimensional body, is not applicable to a body with a low dimension. Then, we propose a new theory which takes into account the fact that the degrees of freedom are limited. We show that, in this case, the constitutive law which is derived from the standard continuum theory is not anymore equivalent to the Newton's law of motion, and that a correction term has to be introduced. We show that this correction term has a simple physical meaning: it represents the elastic energy which is released when the deformation becomes too large. Then, we use this theory to study the stability of a nano-rod to bending and torsion. We show that the standard continuum theory is not able to describe the stability to bending of a rod with a low diameter, and that a correction term has to be introduced. We also show that the stability to torsion is influenced by the limited number of degrees of freedom.",
        " Please write a peer review for the paper of Semantic Noise Modeling for Better Representation Learning, its main content is as below: Latent representation learned from multi-layered neural networks via hierarchical feature abstraction enables recent success of deep learning. Under the deep learning framework, generalization performance highly depends on the learned latent representation. In this work, we propose a novel latent space modeling method to learn better latent representation. We designed a neural network model based on the assumption that good base representation for supervised tasks can be attained by maximizing the sum of hierarchical mutual informations between the input, latent, and output variables. From this base model, we introduce a semantic noise modeling method which enables semantic perturbation on the latent space to enhance the representational power of learned latent feature. During training, latent vector representation can be stochastically perturbed by a modeled additive noise while preserving its original semantics. It implicitly brings the effect of semantic augmentation on the latent space. The proposed model can be easily learned by back-propagation with common gradient-based optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed method helps to achieve performance benefits against various previous approaches. We also provide the empirical analyses for the proposed latent space modeling method including t-SNE visualization.\n\nComment: Please do not post your homework questions here.\n\nComment: @MohammadAli I am not asking for homework.

Use approximately 200-400 words.\nTitle: \"The evolution of interstellar clouds in a streaming hot plasma including heat conduction\".\nAbstract:\nWe study the thermal instability and fragmentation of an initially uniform, isothermal cloud embedded in a hot plasma flow with constant velocity shear using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The initial temperature difference between the cloud and its surroundings leads to the development of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the cloud boundary which grow into mushroom-like structures that are unstable against Kelvin-Helmholtz modes as well. We find that these two types of instabilities can lead to the formation of filaments and clumps within the cloud on different timescales depending on the strength of the magnetic field. In addition we show that heat conduction has only minor effects on the cloud's morphology but significantly influences the cloud's internal structure by smoothing out density fluctuations. Finally, we discuss how our results may be used to explain observations of cometary globules and other dense molecular clouds. Subject headings: Instability -Conductivity -Magnetic fields -Clouds",
        "Tesla's \"Battery Farms\" are essentially large-scale battery storage facilities that are designed to store renewable energy, such as solar and wind, for later use. The goal of these battery farms is to help solve one of the biggest challenges facing the renewable energy industry, which is the intermittent nature of many renewable energy sources.\n\nThe idea behind battery farms is simple - during times when renewable sources are generating more energy than is immediately needed (sunny days, windy days, etc.), this excess energy can be stored in the battery farm for later use. Then, during times when renewable sources are not generating as much energy as is needed (e.g. nighttime, when the sun is not shining), the stored energy from the battery farm can be used to provide power.\n\nAs for how these battery farms work, Tesla uses a specialized battery storage system called the Powerpack. These Powerpacks are large containers filled with lithium-ion batteries that are capable of storing an enormous amount of energy. The battery farms themselves consist of multiple Powerpacks connected together and to an inverter that converts the direct current (DC) energy stored in the batteries into alternating current (AC) energy that can be used to power homes and businesses.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Tesla's battery farms is their ability to help \"smooth out\" the peaks and valleys in energy demand. By storing excess energy during periods of high renewable energy generation, these battery farms can help provide consistent, reliable power to the grid even when renewable sources are not at their peak. Overall, Tesla's battery farms are an important step forward in the race towards a more sustainable, renewable energy future.",

Soak any cleaned filters in acid solution to dissolve minerals that accumulate in the filter media reducing the rate water can pass through the filter. Allow any cleaned filters to dry thoroughly, preferably in bright sunshine, which has effective algaecide properties. Shake or use an air compressor to remove loose particles from the filter's fabric. Save the filters you would normally throw in the trash until you have several to clean. Remove the filters and rinse in a bucket of clean water. Hang or place the filters in bright sunlight and allow them to dry thoroughly. Seal the bucket you soak the filters in when not in use so you won't have to add additional chlorinator each time you clean filters.

Different from existing work where basic morphing types on the layer level were addressed, we target at the central problem of network morphism at a higher level, i.e., how a convolutional layer can be morphed into an arbitrary module of a neural network. To simplify the representation of a network, we abstract a module as a graph with blobs as vertices and convolutional layers as edges, based on which the morphing process is able to be formulated as a graph transformation problem. Two atomic morphing operations are introduced to compose the graphs, based on which modules are classified into two families, i.e., simple morphable modules and complex modules. We present practical morphing solutions for both of these two families, and prove that any reasonable module can be morphed from a single convolutional layer. Extensive experiments have been conducted based on the state-of-the-art ResNet on benchmark datasets, and the effectiveness of the proposed solution has been verified.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{Problem addressed:} In this work we study the problem of network morphism, an effective learning scheme to morph a well-trained neural network to a new one with the network function completely preserved.

        "In early 20th century, the typical “middle class” or wealthy home would have a number of dishes in the dining room set that people would eat from. The typical daily meal for a young unmarried woman living in the United States in the early 1900s would be similar to those dishes; with the main dish being meat and potatoes, with vegetables and starch on the side. The typical daily meal for such a person in this time and location would be very similar to what an American today would consider “plain” or “normal.” In fact, the typical daily menu for such a person at this time would be very similar to the majority of middle-class American menus today. Typical daily meals in turn of the 20th century USA would consist of meat and potatoes for the main dish, with the meat usually being some form of beef or pork. The “favorite” dish of the typical family in early 20th century USA would be Sunday Dinner, often made with a roast leg of lamb. Typically, the Sunday dinner would be accompanied by homemade German-style fried potatoes, known as “ hash browns.” Sunday dinner would also often include other popular dishes such as roasted chicken, boiled chicken, sautéed fish, and boiled potatoes. Fruits would typically be served with dessert after the main meal was complete, and would include things like apples, oranges, grapes, pears, plums, and cherries. Most Americans today would consider most of these foods to be typical or “normal” for the time and place. The typical diet of a young unmarried woman living in the United States in the early 1900s would be considered “healthy” by most standards today. Text from James C. Ballagh, Jessica Land, and Garyraj recreating the early 20th century (1900) American diet. This content was generated by a third-party service and was not vetted or edited by Move Marketing. The typical diet for a young unmarried woman living in the United States in the early 1900s would be considered “healthy” by most standards today. This is likely because at this time the typical “middle class” household in the United States would include a number of dinner dishes that often included meats and potatoes. Foods like German-style fried potatoes, Sunday dinner, and fruit would often be included on the weekly menu. Such a diet would consist of healthy components such as fruits and whole grains, and would be low in processed foods and unhealthy fats and sugars. Overall, the typical diet for a young unmarried woman living in the United States in the early 1900s would likely be considered “normal” or “plain” by modern standards, given that this is before the wide-spread adoption of convenience foods and restaurant dining. Additionally, the typical menu does not contain many “specialty” dishes or “fancy” foods, and does not diverge significantly from the typical American diet today.",
        " Write a peer review by first describing what problem or question this paper addresses, then strengths and weaknesses, for the paper Near-Data Processing for Machine Learning, its main content is as below: In computer architecture, near-data processing (NDP) refers to augmenting the memory or the storage with processing power so that it can process the data stored therein. By offloading the computational burden of CPU and saving the need for transferring raw data in its entirety, NDP exhibits a great potential for acceleration and power reduction. Despite this potential, specific research activities on NDP have witnessed only limited success until recently, often owing to performance mismatches between logic and memory process technologies that put a limit on the processing capability of memory. Recently, there have been two major changes in the game, igniting the resurgence of NDP with renewed interest. The first is the success of machine learning (ML), which often demands a great deal of computation for training, requiring frequent transfers of big data. The second is the advent of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) containing multicore processors that can accommodate extra computation for data processing. Sparked by these application needs and technological support, we evaluate the potential of NDP for ML using a new SSD platform that allows us to simulate in-storage processing (ISP) of ML workloads. Our platform (named ISP-ML) is a full-fledged simulator of a realistic multi-channel SSD that can execute various ML algorithms using the data stored in the SSD. For thorough performance analysis and in-depth comparison with alternatives, we focus on a specific algorithm: stochastic gradient decent (SGD), which is the de facto standard for training differentiable learning machines including deep neural networks. We implement and compare three variants of SGD (synchronous, Downpour, and elastic averaging) using ISP-ML, exploiting the multiple NAND channels for parallelizing SGD. In addition, we compare the performance of ISP and that of conventional in-host processing, revealing the advantages of ISP. Based on the advantages and limitations identified through our experiments, we further discuss directions for future research on ISP for accelerating ML.\n",
        "\n\nThis paper addresses the problem of sampling from a leaky rectified linear unit (Leaky-ReLU) restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). The paper proposes a new sampling strategy, annealing Gaussian into ReLU, which is an alternative to the commonly used annealed importance sampling (AIS). The paper also provides insights into the joint and marginal distributions of the Leaky-ReLU RBM by connecting it to truncated Gaussian distributions.\n\nThe strengths of this paper include its thorough analysis of the joint and marginal distributions of the Leaky-ReLU RBM, as well as its clear explanation of the annealing Gaussian into ReLU sampling strategy. The paper also provides evidence that the proposed sampling algorithm has faster mixing property than the contrastive divergence algorithm.\n\nThe main weakness of this paper is that it does not provide a comparison between the annealing Gaussian into ReLU sampling strategy and the AIS. Additionally, the paper does not provide any empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling strategy.",
        "The fact that all galaxies complete one revolution every billion years is significant for several reasons. First, this periodicity is a measure of the rotation rate of galaxies, often referred to as the galactic year. The galactic year is an important parameter in understanding the dynamics of galaxies. Second, it allows us to estimate the mass of galaxies and their dark matter content.\n\nThe rotation rate of galaxies is determined by several factors such as their mass distribution, the presence of dark matter, and the external gravitational influences. The galactic year is a measure of how long it takes for a galaxy to rotate once around its center. The period of the galactic year can be calculated by measuring the velocity of stars or gas clouds within the galaxy. This measurement has provided important insights into the dynamics of galaxies.\n\nThe galactic year also provides insight into the mass and dark matter content of galaxies. The mass distribution of a galaxy can be calculated by measuring the rotation curve, which is the graph of the rotational velocity against the distance from the center of the galaxy. The rotational velocity beyond a certain radius should decrease according to the inverse square law, but observations show that it remains constant or even increases. This is indicative of the presence of dark matter, an invisible substance that exerts gravitational forces on visible matter in a galaxy. By measuring the rotation curve, we can estimate the mass of the galaxy and the dark matter content.\n\nIn conclusion, the fact that all galaxies complete one revolution every billion years is significant in understanding the mechanics of what makes them tick. It provides us with valuable information on the dynamics, mass distribution, and dark matter content of galaxies. With this knowledge, we can better understand the evolution and behavior of galaxies, which in turn sheds light on the larger structure and evolution of the universe.",

        "The functioning of remote control devices such as TV remote and game controllers is based on their power-saving mechanisms, which are designed to conserve energy and prevent battery exhaustion. While both devices operate using radio frequency signals, the mechanisms behind power conservation in a remote control device are different from those in a game controller.\n\nRemote control devices, by nature, require low power for operation. They are also designed to go into standby mode when not in use. This means that the remote control device is not completely off but rather in an energy-saving mode which allows it to still stay connected to the receiver. This standby mode allows the device to conserve energy in a way that minimizes battery consumption. In addition, the circuitry of remote control devices is designed to minimize power usage. For example, some remote controls use micro-controllers which are highly efficient, consume low power, and go into sleep mode whenever possible.\n\nGame controllers, on the other hand, are designed for more intense usage, requiring more energy to operate. When they are not in use, they still consume power as the device is not in standby mode. The device needs to be turned on manually to conserve battery, otherwise, the device remains idle and quickly drains battery power. The circuitry used in game controllers is often more complex and includes multiple sensors, high-speed processors, and other power-consuming components.\n\nIn summary, while remote control devices are designed with power-saving mechanisms in mind, game controllers are designed to consume more power during usage. The mechanisms behind power conservation in remote controls are designed to minimize power consumption, while those in game controllers are designed to optimize their performance. Therefore, the difference in power consumption between these devices can be attributed to their unique design features.",

        "\n\nUsing VIMOS on the Very Large Telescope, the morphological and spectroscopic characteristics of three radio galaxies at a redshift of 2.5, MRC 1558-003, MRC 2025-218 and MRC 0140-257, and the giant (~60 kpc) Ly-alpha nebulae associated with them were explored. While the form of the nebulae differed, they were all aligned with the radio axis within 30°. The luminosity of the Ly-alpha nebulae was found to range from 0.3 to 3.4 x 10^44 erg/s, and the Ly-alpha spectral profile presented strong variation with the full-width half-maximum ranging from 400-1500 km/s and with velocity shifts from V ~ 120-600 km/s. A model explaining the Ly-alpha morphological and spectroscopic properties associated with MRC 1568-003 was proposed, although the difficulty to reproduce the large FWHM values proved to be a challenge. Furthermore, a giant Ly-alpha nebula of ~85kpc with remarkably smooth motions (FWHM< 300 km/s and V< 120 km/s) was found connected to the radio galaxy MRC 0140-257 at a redshift of 2.64- an unparalleled observation among high-redshift (>2) radio galaxies.",
        "\n\nBuilding a straight form for concrete is an important step in achieving a well-laid out slab of concrete. A straight form will not only create a stronger finished product but also allow for a neater finish. With some common tools and a few materials, any homeowner can follow this guide to build a straight form for concrete.\n\nFirst, lay out the corner positions of the slab using stakes and string lines. Using this initial layout, you can measure diagonally from corner to corner on rectangle or square slabs, shifting parallel sides until both diagonal measurements are equal. Make sure the sides remain the desired widths. \n\nAfter you have the basic layout firmly established, you can begin placing form boards along the strings, staking them in at about 1/8th of an inch from the line. Use sharpened wood stakes to firmly hold the boards in place. For a 4 inch slab, be sure to stake at least 32 inches apart on center, driving the stakes deep enough to solidly support the form. Take extra care to pack the soil around the stakes, and make slight adjustments as necessary to ensure the form is in line with the string. You may even need to install a gauge block to keep the string clear of the form and measure frequent intervals to make sure the form remains straight.\n\nFor thicker slabs, you may want to take extra precautions and drive a row of stakes behind the form, approximately two to three feet away. Using the offset stake, nail a kicker or 2x4 board to the stake that is attached to the form. This extra insurance will ensure that form remains stable and secure throughout the process.\n\nOnce you have finished laying out the form, double check it to make sure that it is straight and true. If all looks good, it's time to pour your concrete and begin to enjoy the benefits of adding a new concrete slab to your property or project. With a little patience and attention to detail, you can have a straightforward and well-built form that will help guarantee success for your new concrete slab.",
        "A star can get caught in the gravitational pull of a larger companion star and be pulled into a tight orbit around the larger star, like a planet is pulled into a orbit around a sun. This type of relationship is known as a binary system. There are hundreds of binary star systems in our own Milky Way galaxy alone. Binary star systems occur when two individual stars of similar size and composition orbit within their own defined regions of space, typically due to the energy released by their component parts. The closer two stars are in orbit the more likely that they will eventually become a binary star system. Although typically individual in nature, binary star systems can also contain three or more components. As with any system of two or more bodies, the interactions between the components can be complex. In addition to gravitational forces, stars also experience electromagnetic and nuclear forces. This can result in changes to the individual paths and relationships of the components. Despite this, many binary star systems remain stable over very long time periods.",

        "The Aztecs had no concept of a geography that included the western hemisphere. They may have heard of the outside world through their trade with foreign emissaries, but it was far from their understanding that countries could be so far apart and have such radically different cultures. They may have been incredulous of the notion of lands and people on the other side of the ocean, assuming that it was some kind of illusion or witchcraft. But even after they captured Spanish prisoners and examined their Roman Catholic religious artifacts, they could still not conceive of any population capable of creating such amazing devices. And though they did kill many of the prisoners, it did not change their minds. A secret research facility, operating under the guise of a university, was able to continue their work, secretly creating even more advanced technology, while carefully monitoring the progress of the Europeans in their new world. As the years passed and the Spanish colony dwindled, the Aztecs became more and more fascinated with the strangers’ technologies. And as the Europeans became less frequent visitors to their shores, the Aztecs began to realize that their tales of the “Others” who lived on the other side of the ocean were far less fantastic than they’d believed. They quickly realized that the “Others” were able to create incredible devices; the Roman Catholic religious artifacts they’d acquired from the Spanishprisoners themselves became their proof. And once they realized that the Spaniards were in fact human, and not demons or gods returned, the Aztecs lost all hope of defeating them in battle. Their own weapons were far too crude and primitive in comparison to the technologies the Spaniards had acquired from the “Others.” And though the Aztecs fought hard and long, their forces were no match for their opponents, and the Spanish colonists were able to flourish and grow in their new world. The exact origins of the Spanish colonization of the Americas remain a mystery. The “Others” had returned their inquisitive captives to their home country, purposely withholding the advanced technology they’d acquired. But despite their lack of technological progress, their civilization had reached a pinnacle, and the Spanish colonists sought to return to their new world in order to establish a Spanish empire, leaving the Others to continue their research in secret. As the years passed, the Spanish colonists began to develop their own technology, improving on their Roman Catholic religious artifacts, reverse engineering them to create the wealth that the Spanish Crown desired. As their technology grew more sophisticated, the Spanish were finally able to return to their new world, where they finally defeated the Aztec empire. Now, more than 500 years later, the Spanish are back in pursuit of a mysterious cache of advanced technology, leading to yet another war with a long-exiled empire from another world. But even after all these years, the “Others” have not revealed their great secret, and the civilization",
