        "Data from {\\it Chandra} observations of thirty nearby galaxies were analyzedand 365 X-ray point sources were chosen whose spectra were not contaminated byexcessive diffuse emission and not affected by photon pile up. The spectra ofthese sources were fitted using two spectral models (an absorbed power-law anda disk blackbody) to ascertain the dependence of estimated parameters on thespectral model used. It was found that the cumulative luminosity functiondepends on the choice of the spectral model, especially for luminosities $>10^{40}$ ergs/s. In accordance with previous results, a large number ($\\sim80$) of the sources have luminosities $> 10^{39}$ ergs/s (Ultra-Luminous X-raysources) with indistinguishable average spectral parameters (inner disktemperature $\\sim 1$ keV and/or photon index $\\Gamma \\sim 2$) with those of thelower luminosities ones. After considering foreground stars and knownbackground AGN,we identify four sources whose minimum luminosity exceed$10^{40}$ ergs/s, and call them Extremely Luminous X-ray sources (ELX). Thespectra of these sources are in general better represented by the disk blackbody model than the power-law one. These ELX can be grouped into two distinctspectral classes. Two of them have an inner disk temperature of $< 0.5$ keV andhence are called ``supersoft'' ELX, while the other two have temperatures$\\gtrsim 1.3$ keV and are called ``hard'' ELX. The estimated inner disktemperatures of the supersoft ELX are compatible with the hypothesis that theyharbor intermediate size black holes, which are accreting at $\\sim 0.5$ timestheir Eddington Luminosity. The radiative mechanism for hard ELX, seems to beInverse Comptonization, which in contrast to standard black holes systems, isprobably saturated.",
        "Members of the National Union of Students (NUS-USI) are holding their annual conference in Templepatrick, County Antrim, on Tuesday.Ahead of the conference, the NUS president Rebecca Hall said continued budget cuts would create a \"lost generation\" of students in the future.She also called on the government to lower the voting age to 16.The Department for Employment and Learning (DEL), which is responsible for higher education funding in Northern Ireland, is facing cuts of Â£82m or 10.8% from its annual spending.\"This is arguably the first generation that could have worse prospects than their parents,\" Ms Hall said.\"They could have less education opportunities, they have worse job prospects, lower pay and higher living costs than their parents.\"Many in this generation also feel they have to leave Northern Ireland. They could become a lost generation if government does not act to address these deeply damaging issues.\"In 2012, the Stormont assembly backed a motion calling on the voting age to be reduced to 16.However, electoral policy is not devolved and remains the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Office (NIO).Ms Hall said students aged 16 and 17 deserved a chance to vote on issues affecting further education.\"Many further education students cannot have a say on the cuts that will have such a massive impact on their educational lives,\" she said.\"Sixteen-year-olds pay tax to the government so why should they not have a say on how their taxes are spent?\"",

        "CO observations have been so far the best way to trace molecular gas inexternal galaxies, but at low metallicity the gas mass deduced could be largelyunderestimated. At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are usedto estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds.Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and couldunveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared indifferent environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deducedfrom millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in ourGalaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of thenearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deducedfrom millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma rayanalysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses aresystematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeterdust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has alreadybeen reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud massesdeduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice onaverage for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity)than the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can notbe accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a generalform for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds andexplain the difference observed. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have thereforebeen underestimated so far. Magnetic pressure may contribute significantly totheir support.",
        "We investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes canhelp each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies inthe single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given themyriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routingproblem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from thesource to the destination. We find that for a given route, thedecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperativecoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable bythe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperativecoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in termsof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithmruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm thatruns in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route whenthe nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategiesusing practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance ofthe strategies on different routes.",

        "We perform a time-dependent study of the driven dynamics of overdampedparticles which are placed in a one-dimensional, piecewise linear randompotential. This set-up of spatially quenched disorder then exerts a dichotomousvarying random force on the particles. We derive the path integralrepresentation of the resulting probability density function for the positionof the particles and transform this quantity of interest into the form of aFourier integral. In doing so, the evolution of the probability density can beinvestigated analytically for finite times. It is demonstrated that theprobability density contains both a $\\delta$-singular contribution and aregular part. While the former part plays a dominant role at short times, thelatter rules the behavior at large evolution times. The slow approach of theprobability density to a limiting Gaussian form as time tends to infinity iselucidated in detail.",

        "The family patriarch ascended the grounds and steeled his gaze to the princely lord below. As he mounted his perch on the dewy lawn, a warm Spring breeze belied the shuddering forces soon to be unleashed... Eyes fixed on his hapless target, the elderly man prepared to explosively transform the potential to the kinetic. In his long fingers he rolled a hard, unyielding baseball. Like a practiced dancer, his right arm swung back overhead, the ball clenched tightly, split fingers aching to whip the object forward with as much thrust as he could muster. Eyes still fixed on the young boy below, nose down, a bead of sweat breaking on his brow, the force of a thousand lancers from Great Antiquity were called forth; his arm rocketed forward and released the projectile. It sailed over the grass like a cannon ball, dutifully obeying Newtonian physics with all the predictability and peril the Laws imply. As the cannon shot arched toward him, the young princely lord ran all his father' s training through his head in a torrent of words and memories. \" Get in front of it. \" \" Keep your eye on the ball. \" \" Do n' t be afraid of it. \" With scant moments to react, the boy placed himself in harm' s way. His leather glove fanned itself out like a flower. His knees bent slightly to prepare for the slightest adjustment in stance. His eyes remained locked on the target like a radar sweep onto a giant flying ship. The mighty missile arced across the Spring sky, momentarily blotting the sun. Gravity eventually won the day as the baseball loomed back toward Earth, its trajectory tailing into the form of small boy. With a mighty flinch, the boy asserted his place in the world. With elegance and skill he heaved his glove up and forward, snatching the sphere from the sky like a Nordic God. With a mighty WHUMP the ball lodged into the net of his glove, a tiny cloud of dust bursting forth from the impact. The smile of the victor crept upon the boy' s face. \" Got it, Dad! \"",

        "The control of open quantum systems has a fundamental relevance for fieldsranging from quantum information processing to nanotechnology. Typically, thesystem whose coherent dynamics one wants to manipulate, interacts with anenvironment that smoothly degrades its quantum dynamics. Thus, a preciseunderstanding of the inner mechanisms of this process, called \"decoherence\", iscritical to develop strategies to control the quantum dynamics. In this thesiswe solved the generalized Liouville-von Neumann quantum master equation toobtain the dynamics of many-spin systems interacting with a spin bath. We alsosolve the spin dynamics within the Keldysh formalism. Both methods lead toidentical solutions and together gave us the possibility to obtain numerousphysical predictions that contrast well with Nuclear Magnetic Resonanceexperiments. We applied these tools for molecular characterizations,development of new numerical methodologies and the control of quantum dynamicsin experimental implementations. But, more important, these results contributedto fundamental physical interpretations of how quantum dynamics behaves in opensystems. In particular, we found a manifestation of an environmentally inducedquantum dynamical phase transition.",

Those involved had \"made an unavoidable mistake\", prosecutors said.Kurdish groups condemned the ruling.In December 2011 Turkey expressed regret over the raid, saying smugglers had been mistaken for Kurdish rebels.Ferhat Encu, who lost two brothers and nine other relatives in the raid, said \"the killer state has been acquitted once again\", the Turkish daily Hurriyet reported on its website.Last November the European Court of Human Rights ruled against Turkey over a similar air strike that took place in 1994. In that incident, 38 Kurdish villagers died in Sirnak province, near the Iraqi border.Uludere is in the same province, an area where armed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) rebels are particularly active. The rebels have been fighting for an independent state since 1984.The European court in Strasbourg ordered Turkey to pay 2.3m euros (£2m; $3m) to the plaintiffs, saying the authorities had failed to investigate the raid properly.The military prosecutors' statement on Tuesday said the December 2011 air strike had been approved by the Turkish General Staff.\"The army personnel made an unavoidable mistake while performing their duties,\" the prosecutors said.A lawyer representing the families of victims, Tahir Elci, denounced the ruling.

        "We consider the simplest generalizations of the valence bond physics of SU(2)singlets to SU(N) singlets that comprise objects with N sites -- these areSU(N) singlet plaquettes with N=3 and N=4 in three spatial dimensions.Specifically, we search for a quantum mechanical liquid of such objects -- aresonating singlet valence plaquette phase that generalizes the celebratedresonating valence bond phase for SU(2) spins. We extend the Rokhsar-Kivelsonconstruction of the quantum dimer model to the simplest SU(4) model for valenceplaquette dynamics on a cubic lattice. The phase diagram of the resultingquantum plaquette model is analyzed both analytically and numerically. We findthat the ground state is solid everywhere, including at the Rokhsar-Kivelsonpoint where the ground state is an equal amplitude sum. By contrast, the equalamplitude sum of SU(3) singlet triangular plaquettes on the face centered cubiclattice is liquid and thus a candidate for describing a resonating singlevalence plaquette phase, given a suitably defined local Hamiltonian.",

The spectral function shows a single resonance peak whichbecomes wider and then disappears as the temperature is increased beyond 450MeV or so. This behaviour can be compared with recently attempted latticereconstructions of the same quantity, based on the ``maximum entropy method'',which generically show several peaks. We also specify the dependence of ourresults on the spatial momentum of the electromagnetic current, as well as onthe baryon chemical potential characterising the hot QCD plasma.",

        "Aims and Methods: We present the results of VLBI observations of nineteenGHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources at 1.6 GHz. Of them, 15 sources areselected from the Parkes Half Jansky (PHJ) sample (Snellen 2002), 4 others arefrom our previous observation list. We aimed at imaging the structure of GPSsources, searching for Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) and studying theabsorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS sources.  Results: We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17 sources forthe first time. Of them, 80% show mini-double-lobe radio structure, indicatingthat they are CSOs or candidates, and their host AGNs could be edge-on to us.This result suggests that there is a high incidence of mini double-lobe sources(or CSOs) in the PHJ sample. The sources J0323+0534, J1135-0021, J1352+0232,J2058+0540, J2123-0112 and J2325-0344 with measured redshift, showingdouble-lobe structure with sizes of <1 kpc, are classified as CSOs.

It described the claim that employees brought files to Uber with the goal of creating \"copycat\" technology as \"demonstrably false.\"Mr. Levandowski has declined to testify in the case, launched in February.The firing was confirmed by an Uber spokeswoman, who said it was effective Tuesday.Mr Levandowski had already been removed from working on the self-driving car technology at the heart of the suit.He started working at Uber in August 2016, when the firm bought Otto, the self-driving truck start-up he had created in the six months after leaving Google.He declined to testify earlier this year, citing his right to avoid self-incrimination.Uber maintains its technology is different to Waymo's and says there isn't evidence the files are on its servers. But its search did not include Mr Levandowski's computer.Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing the case in San Francisco, earlier ordered Uber to return the thousands of \"pilfered\" files in question by the end of the month.A spokeswoman for Uber said the firing occurred after Mr Levandowski failed to meet the deadline that would allow Uber to cooperate with the judge's order.Word of the firing was sent to employees on Tuesday.Attorneys for Mr Levandowski could not be reached for comment immediately.",

        "I propose a path integral description of the Su-Schrieffer-HeegerHamiltonian, both in one and two dimensions, after mapping the real space modelonto the time scale. While the lattice degrees of freedom are classicalfunctions of time and are integrated out exactly, the electron particle pathsare treated quantum mechanically. The method accounts for the variable range ofthe electronic hopping processes. The free energy of the system and itstemperature derivatives are computed by summing at any $T$ over the ensemble ofrelevant particle paths which mainly contribute to the total partitionfunction. In the low $T$ regime, the {\\it heat capacity over T} ratio shows unupturn peculiar to a glass-like behavior. This feature is more sizeable in thesquare lattice than in the linear chain as the overall hopping potentialcontribution to the total action is larger in higher dimensionality.

        "We present a model for smectic elastomer membranes which includes elastic andliquid crystalline degrees of freedom. Based on our model, we determined thequalitative phase diagram of a smectic elastomer membrane using mean-fieldtheory. This phase diagram is found to comprise five phases, viz.smectic-A--flat, smectic-A--crumpled, smectic-C--flat, smectic-C--crumpled andsmectic-C--tubule, where in the latter phase, the membrane is flat in thedirection of mesogenic tilt and crumpled in the perpendicular direction. Thetransitions between adjacent phases are second order phase transitions. Westudy in some detail the elasticity of the smectic-C--flat and thesmectic-C--tubule phases which are associated with a spontaneous breaking ofin-plane rotational symmetry. As a consequence of the Goldstone theorem, thesephases exhibit soft elasticity characterized by the vanishing of in-plane shearmoduli.",

        "We present new observational results obtained for the Galactic non-thermalradio source G328.4+0.2 to determine both if this source is a pulsar windnebula or supernova remnant, and in either case, the physical properties ofthis source. Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-rayemission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by apower law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, theX-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller thanthe radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantlyoffset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7arcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia TelescopeCompact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes RadioTelescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though someareas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral indexof ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar ofL_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of theseobservational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or alarge PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic modelfor the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, weconclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebulaformed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly(<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs),low ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in alow density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.",

        "The generator coordinate (GC) method is a variational approach to the quantummany-body problem in which interacting many-body wave functions are constructedas superpositions of (generally nonorthogonal) eigenstates of auxiliaryHamiltonians containing a deformation parameter. This paper presents atime-dependent extension of the GC method as a new approach to improve existingapproximations of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential in time-dependentdensity-functional theory (TDDFT). The time-dependent GC method is shown to bea conceptually and computationally simple tool to build memory effects into anyexisting adiabatic XC potential. As an illustration, the method is applied todriven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonicpotential (Hooke's atom). It is demonstrated that a proper choice oftime-dependent generator coordinates in conjunction with the adiabaticlocal-density approximation reproduces the exact linear and nonlineartwo-electron dynamics quite accurately, including features associated withdouble excitations that cannot be captured by TDDFT in the adiabaticapproximation.",
        "The \"power of choice\" has been shown to radically alter the behavior of anumber of randomized algorithms. Here we explore the effects of choice onmodels of tree and network growth. In our models each new node has k randomlychosen contacts, where k > 1 is a constant. It then attaches to whichever oneof these contacts is most desirable in some sense, such as its distance fromthe root or its degree. Even when the new node has just two choices, i.e., whenk=2, the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree.For instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to theroot of the tree, the distribution of depths changes from Poisson to atraveling wave solution. If the new node attaches to the contact with thesmallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a randomgraph, so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network withdegree greater than O(log log N). Finally, if the new node attaches to thecontact with the largest degree, we find that the degree distribution is apower law with exponent -1 up to degrees roughly equal to k, with anexponential cutoff beyond that; thus, in this case, we need k >> 1 to see apower law over a wide range of degrees.",

And I admit my biggest pet complaint is that I have requested some kind of ground poultry (eg turkey) be carried fresh. I don't think that's unreasonable in 2013. The owner responded to my request with a simple \"no. \" nnOk. I still shop there for some things, so clearly it's not a deal-breaker. Not my shop, but I would bet heavily that a freshly ground turkey or chicken would move. Just saying. nnI'll end on a high note. They have great steaks, great beef and pork all around,  Try a pork griller over live goals, indirect heat. Man. Their bacon wrapped pork filets are terrific, too. And the chuck makes a damn fine burger. Oh, bonus, they carry a tempting selection of sweet treats, including chocolates, bakery, etc.",

        "Unfortunately, I did not have the great experience others did. I ended up getting probably the worst haircut I'd had in 10 years. It ended up a good 4 inches shorter than I discussed with the stylist. In addition, she took the fact that I work in a professional office to mean that I wanted an ugly, boring, mom-ish haircut. It's taken almost a year to grow back to the length it was before. I admittedly should have complained then and there, but I'm a wuss. nnAdditionally, the experience at the salon left much to be desired. I went in the late morning on a weekday. There was a little girl there (around 3 or 4) with her nanny. Apparently her mom was a regular customer. The little girl was getting a haircut and she cried and screamed for 25 minutes. I know kids will be kids, and I don't blame the little girl for being scared or cranky. I do blame the salon for not finding a way for the girl not to disrupt the entire salon - taking her to a back room, taking her outside to calm down, not allowing children in an adult, supposedly high-end salon, etc. Something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache. nnI will not be back here, but it seems like others had great experiences.",

        "Recently, we discussed the first example of a phenomenologically realisticintersecting D6-brane model. In this model, the gauge symmetry in the hiddensector is USp(2)_1 x USp(2)_2 x USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4. However, we find that theUSp(2)_1 x USp(2)_2 gauge symmetry can be replaced by an U(2)_{12} gaugesymmetry, and/or the USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4 gauge symmetry can be replaced by anU(2)_{34} gauge symmetry since the USp(2)^2 stacks of D6-branes contribute tothe same Ramond-Ramond tadpoles as those of the U(2) stacks. Thus, there arethree non-equivalent variations of the hidden sector, and the correspondinggauge symmetries are U(2)_{12} x USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4, U(2)_{34} x USp(2)_1 xUSp(2)_2, and U(2)_{12} x U(2)_{34}, respectively. Moreover, we study thehidden sector gauge symmetry breaking, discuss how to decouple the additionalexotic particles, and briefly comment on the phenomenological consequences.",

Slowly and carefully he began opening the door. The door only opened an inch before it could open no more. The only thing to be heard through the crack was the sound of metal on metal as the heavy door struck the large object on the other side. He thought back to entering the room.

        "Future nano-scale electronics built up from an Avogadro number of componentsneeds efficient, highly scalable, and robust means of communication in order tobe competitive with traditional silicon approaches. In recent years, theNetworks-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm emerged as a promising solution to interconnectchallenges in silicon-based electronics. Current NoC architectures are eitherhighly regular or fully customized, both of which represent implausibleassumptions for emerging bottom-up self-assembled molecular electronics thatare generally assumed to have a high degree of irregularity and imperfection.Here, we pragmatically and experimentally investigate important designtrade-offs and properties of an irregular, abstract, yet physically plausible3D small-world interconnect fabric that is inspired by modern network-on-chipparadigms. We vary the framework's key parameters, such as the connectivity,the number of switch nodes, the distribution of long- versus short-rangeconnections, and measure the network's relevant communication characteristics.We further explore the robustness against link failures and the ability andefficiency to solve a simple toy problem, the synchronization task. The resultsconfirm that (1) computation in irregular assemblies is a promising anddisruptive computing paradigm for self-assembled nano-scale electronics and (2)that 3D small-world interconnect fabrics with a power-law decaying distributionof shortcut lengths are physically plausible and have major advantages overlocal 2D and 3D regular topologies.",

        "Efficient injection of spin-polarized electrons into the conduction band ofsilicon is limited by the formation of a silicide at the ferromagnetic metal(FM)/silicon interface. In the present work, this \"magnetically-dead\" silicide(where strong spin-scattering significantly reduces injected spin polarization)is eliminated by moving the FM in the spin injector from the tunnel junctionbase anode to the emitter cathode and away from the silicon surface. Thisresults in over an order-of-magnitude increase in spin injection efficiency,from a previously-reported magnetocurrent ratio of ~2% to ~35% and an estimatedspin polarization in Si from ~1% to at least ~15%. The injector tunnel-junctionbias dependence of this spin transport signal is also measured, demonstratingthe importance of low bias voltage to preserve high injected spin polarization.",

I' d guess six foot and kinda hefty. Imagine Melissa McCarthy but taller and younger. I would n' t say she was a day over twenty. She began looking around for a seat. I knew the only open seat was beside me. It was that or stand, and by the looks of her, she' d stand. It was obvious she had never rode in a train before. I simply smiled at her and offered the seat beside me. She thanked me quietly and sat down. She placed her purse between her legs on the floor and laid her jacket on top of it. She was dressed for what I could only assume is an interview or a first day. Her make up was immaculate, soft pink lips and a rosy complexion, and her hair braided with such precision. Definitely an interview. I smiled at her again. \" First train ride? \" She nodded, but said nothing. Her cheeks turned a soft pink. \" It' s always a little nerve wracking. I' m Tom. \" I held out my hand. \" Bap. \" She shook my hand. God she was warm! \" So, uh, we are you headed to? I, myself, am headed to Jacksonville. \" \" I am too.

        "In this paper we present our results of a comprehensive spectroscopicanalysisof WASP-1, the host star to the exoplanet WASP-1b. We derive T_eff = 6110 +/-45 K, log g = 4.28 +/- 0.15, and [M/H] = 0.23 +/- 0.08, and also a highabundance of lithium, log n(Li) = 2.91 +/- 0.05. These parameters suggests anage for the system of 1-3 Gyr and a stellar mass of 1.25-1.35 M_sun. This meansthat WASP-1 has properties very similar to those of HD 149026, the host starfor the highest density planet yet detected. Moreover, their planets orbit atcomparable distances and receive comparable irradiating fluxes from their hoststars. However, despite the similarity of WASP-1 with HD 149026, their planetshave strongly different densities. This suggests that gas-giant planet densityis not a simple function of host-star metallicity or of radiation environmentat ages of ~2 Gyr.",

        "In this two-part paper, we consider the multiantenna multihop relay channelsin which the source signal arrives at the destination through N independentrelaying hops in series. The main concern of this work is to design relayingstrategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversityis maximized. In part I, we focus on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy withwhich the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. Morespecifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of theAF scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas andarbitrary number of hops. The DMT is in closed-form expression as a function ofthe number of antennas at each node. First, we provide some basic results onthe DMT of the general Rayleigh product channels. It turns out that theseresults have very simple and intuitive interpretation. Then, the results areapplied to the AF multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to theRayleigh product channel, in the DMT sense. Finally, the project-and-forward(PF) scheme, a variant of the AF scheme, is proposed. We show that the PFscheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significantpower gain over the AF scheme in some cases. In part II, we will derive theupper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that it can beachieved by partitioning the multihop channel into AF subchannels.",

        "We present the first X-ray detection of the very young pulsar PSR J1357-6429(characteristic age of 7.3 kyr) using data from the XMM-Newton and Chandrasatellites. We find that the spectrum is well described by a power-law plusblackbody model, with photon index Gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kT=160eV. For the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 keVluminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energychanneled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray emission is one of the lowest observed.The Chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar andallow to set an upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV luminosity of acompact pulsar wind nebula. We do not detect any pulsed emission from thesource and determine an upper limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of theX-ray emission at the radio frequency of the pulsar.",
        "Random networks with specified degree distributions have been proposed asrealistic models of population structure, yet the problem of dynamicallymodeling SIR-type epidemics in random networks remains complex. I resolve thisdilemma by showing how the SIR dynamics can be modeled with a system of threenonlinear ODE's. The method makes use of the probability generating function(PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random networkand makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in awell-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number ofinfecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translatingbetween network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemicincidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking theevolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. Theequations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degreedistribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed withwhich it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions areobserved to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smallerfinal size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson.The equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreementwith the theory. Finally, the dynamic equations provide an alternative way ofdetermining the epidemic threshold where large-scale epidemics are expected tooccur, and below which epidemic behavior is limited to finite-sized outbreaks.",
        "We present measurements of the infrared response of the quasi-one-dimensionalorganic conductor (TMTSF)2$SO3 along (E||a) and perpendicular (E||b') to thestacking axis as a function of temperature. Above the metal-insulatortransition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra showa Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1(185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in theoptical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrationsgives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below thetransition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of thelattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a newinfrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, whichhas so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing ametal-insulator transition. A qualitative model based on the coupling betweenthe TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of electrical dipole momentof the FSO3 anion is proposed, in order to explain the anomalous behavior ofthe new mode.",

        "The phase of Super-Soft-Source (SSS) emission of the sixth recorded outburstof the recurrent nova RS Oph was observed twice with Chandra and once withXMM-Newton. The observations were taken on days 39.7, 54.0, and 66.9 afteroutburst. We confirm a 35-sec period on day 54.0 and found that it originatesfrom the SSS emission and not from the shock. We discus the bound-freeabsorption by neutral elements in the line of sight, resonance absorption linesplus self-absorbed emission line components, collisionally excited emissionlines from the shock, He-like intersystem lines, and spectral changes during anepisode of high-amplitude variability. We find a decrease of the oxygen K-shellabsorption edge that can be explained by photoionization of oxygen. Theabsorption component has average velocities of -1286+-267 km/s on day 39.7 andof -771+-65 km/s on day 66.9. The wavelengths of the emission line componentsare consistent with their rest wavelengths as confirmed by measurements ofnon-self absorbed He-like intersystem lines. We have evidence that these linesoriginate from the shock rather than the outer layers of the outflow and may bephotoexcited in addition to collisional excitations. We found collisionallyexcited emission lines that are fading at wavelengths shorter than 15A thatoriginate from the radiatively cooling shock. On day 39.5 we find a systematicblue shift of -526+-114 km/s from these lines. We found anomalous He-like f/iratios which indicates either high densities or significant UV radiation nearthe plasma where the emission lines are formed. During the phase of strongvariability the spectral hardness light curve overlies the total light curvewhen shifted by 1000sec. This can be explained by photoionization of neutraloxygen in the line of sight if the densities of order 10^{10}-10^{11} cm^{-3}.",
        "We report the detection of the millisecond pulsar B1257+12 with the ChandraX-ray Observatory. In a 20 ks exposure we detected 25 photons from the pulsar,with energies between 0.4 and 2.0 keV, corresponding to the flux F_X=(4.4+/-0.9)*10^{-15} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} in this energy range. The X-ray spectrum canbe described by a power-law model with photon index Gamma = 2.8 and luminosityL_X \\approx 2.5*10^{29} ergs s^{-1} in the 0.3--8 keV band, for a plausibledistance of 500 pc and hydrogen column density N_H=3*10^{20} cm^{-2}.Alternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with kT ~ 0.22keV and projected emitting area ~2000 m^2. If the thermal X-rays are emittedfrom two symmetric polar caps, the bolometric luminosity of the two caps is 2L_bol ~ 3*10^{29} ergs s^{-1}. We compared our results with the data on other30 millisecond pulsars observed in X-rays and found that the apparent X-rayefficiency of PSR B1257+12, L_X/Edot ~ 3*10^{-5} for d=500 pc, is lower thanthose of most of millisecond pulsars. This might be explained by an unfavorableorientation of the X-ray pulsar beam if the radiation is magnetospheric, or bystrong asymmetry of polar caps if the radiation is thermal (e.g., one of thepolar caps is much brighter than the other and remains invisible for most partof the pulsar period). Alternatively, it could be attributed to absorption ofX-rays in circumpulsar matter, such as a flaring debris disk left over afterformation of the planetary system around the pulsar.",

The modern art is very cool, but after being at the Warhol the day before, I had my fill of high-concept stuff. There's quite a bit of Impressionism, which by scientific fact all women love. nnThis is great way to spend a long afternoon and there's plenty to do in Oakland afterwards.",
        "You put your son to bed, and you read your history book to him. Dad can I hear about the other humans story to tonight, said your son. Sure you say! You: a long time ago in 2016, a scientist successfully made a perfect human clone in a lab. That' s us right daddy! Your son says smiling. Yes, but wait. So the clone learns 100x faster, and lives forever, by using tools he makes. He decides that the old humans are worthless, and decides to kill them all to repopulate us! Yea! The bad guys lose! Well they were n' t really bad guys son, we where. Really? Well yea, you ca n' t just kill someone because you do n' t like them can you? Nooooo you son says sadly. Exactly. So after 1, 000, 000 clones made. He launches his war. It was a bloodbath, and the clones retreated. But the world was a mess, and a few more years they fought again, until the clones life span finally caught up with them, and the last human named mada died in 1, 215. That' s a sad story is n' t it dad, it truly is son. Then why did he kill them all dad? Just because he made us a perfect human, does n' t mean he are n' t human son. What is it mean to be human daddy? It used to be used as a saying that we are n' t perfect. We make mistakes. Ironically being human lead to their death. Are we gods daddy? Without sheep, we are merely lions son.",
        "The report suggested splitting the current role, as both head of the legal system and president of the States.Political expert Dr Adrian Lee said the dual role was unique to the islands.He said they were the only democratic jurisdictions in the world where the person judging a case had been involved in making the law.The Carswell Committee, which authored the report, suggested Jersey's Bailiff should step down as president of the States of Jersey and be replaced by an elected speaker.Lord Carswell said: \"There are various international constitutional documents, which rather frown on the idea of judges having anything to do with the legislator.\"He said there was also a practical reason, as in recent years the Jersey Bailiff had had to spend increasing amounts of time on States work.Dr Lee, a former professor of politics at Plymouth University, said: \"The Carswell Committee also made the point that as the two islands increasingly develop their international personalities, as they're called, it's important that their legal systems and political systems are clear to the outside world.\"At the moment there is some lack of clarity over who is speaking on behalf of, who's representing the island - is it the chief minister, the Lieutenant Governor, the Bailiff or is it all three?\"A spokesperson for Guernsey's Policy Council said it would watch the developments in Jersey with interest.Guernsey States Assembly and Constitution Committee said it intended to discuss the report at a meeting next week.The dual role of both bailiffs came under the spotlight after Sark decided to spilt the role of seneschal, who was both chief judge and president of Chief Pleas, in October following pressure from outside of the island.",

        "We present an atlas of the central regions of 75 Seyfert galaxies imaged inthe near-UV with the Advanced Camera for Surveys of the Hubble Space Telescopeat an average resolution of ~10pc. These data complement archival highresolution data from the Space Telescope at optical and near-IR wavelengths,creating an extremely valuable dataset for astronomers with a broad range ofscientific interests. Our goal is to investigate the nature of the near-UVlight in these objects, its relation to the circumnuclear starburst phenomenon,and the connection of this to the evolution and growth of the galaxy bulge andcentral black hole. In this paper, we describe the near-UV morphology of theobjects and characterize the near-UV emission. We estimate the size and theluminosity of the emitting regions and extract the luminosity profile. We alsodetermine the presence of unresolved compact nuclei. In addition, thecircumnuclear stellar cluster population is identified, and the contribution ofthe stellar clusters to the total light, at this wavelength, is estimated. Thesize of the sample allows us to draw robust statistical conclusions. We findthat {Seyfert 1} galaxies are completely dominated by its bright and compactnucleus, that remains point-like at this resolution, while we find almost nounresolved nucleus in Seyfert 2. The Seyfert types 1 and 2 are quite segregatedin an asymmetry vs compactness plot. Stellar clusters are found somewhat morefrequently in Sy2 (in ~70% of the galaxies) than in Sy1 (~57%), and contributemore to the total light in Sy2, but this two differences seem to be mostly dueto the large contribution of the compact nucleus in Sy1, as the luminositydistribution of the clusters is similar in both Sy types.",
        "Last night, the two of us decided to walk in early (about 6: 00 P. M. on a Friday night, our date night) and were immediately seated. We were put in a back room containing two large, long tables and a few tables for four. One of the large tables was already filled with about 20 people, and the noise was deafening. That entire room apparently has nothing on the walls or ceiling to absorb noise. We noticed that, at one of the tables for four, people were getting up and leaving without ordering. Even worse, the place has a lot of young children who were constantly running around and getting in the way of the waitstaff which, by the way, was excellent. nnWe started with two Ketel One on the rocks. When ordering a second round, we were told they had run out of Ketel One--at 6: 15 on a Friday night. We then split a Waldhorn salad, which was good. We both had the sauerbraten with spaeztle and red cabbage. The meat was dry and the spaetzle didn't even look or taste like spaetzle. From our experience, spaetzle are dumplings pressed through a sieve.. This stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles. Since I love Black Forest cake, I took a piece home. It was tasteless, and the fruit center was nothing more than filler. This was represented to us as \"home made. \"nnThe owners of this place are represented as having been culinary-institute trained.

        "Accreting T Tauri stars are observed to be less luminous in X-rays thannon-accretors, an effect that has been detected in various star formingregions. To explain this we have combined, for the first time, a radiativetransfer code with an accretion model that considers magnetic fieldsextrapolated from surface magnetograms obtained from Zeeman-Doppler imaging.Such fields consist of compact magnetic regions close to the stellar surface,with extended field lines interacting with the disc. We study the propagationof coronal X-rays through the magnetosphere and demonstrate that they arestrongly absorbed by the dense gas in accretion columns. The reduction in theobserved X-ray emission depends on the field geometry, which may explain whyaccreting T Tauri stars show a larger scatter in their observed X-rayluminosity compared to non-accreting stars.",

        "The paper is considering an opportunity for the CERN/GranSasso (CNGS)neutrino complex, concurrent time-wise with T2K and NOvA, to search fortheta_13 oscillations and CP violation. Compared with large water Cherenkov(T2K) and fine grained scintillators (NOvA), the LAr-TPC offers a higherdetection efficiency and a lower backgrounds, since virtually all channels maybe unambiguously recognized. The present proposal, called MODULAr, describes a20 kt fiducial volume LAr-TPC, following very closely the technology developedfor the ICARUS-T60o, and is focused on the following activities, for which weseek an extended international collaboration:  (1) the neutrino beam from the CERN 400 GeV proton beam and an optimised hornfocussing, eventually with an increased intensity in the framework of the LHCaccelerator improvement program;  (2) A new experimental area LNGS-B, of at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axisfrom the main Laboratory, eventually upgradable to larger sizes. A location isunder consideration at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth;  (3) A new LAr Imaging detector of at least 20 kt fiducial mass. Such anincrease in the volume over the current ICARUS T600 needs to be carefullyconsidered. It is concluded that a very large mass is best realised with a setof many identical, independent units, each of 5 kt, \"cloning\" the technology ofthe T600.

        "The rate of nuclear muon capture by the proton has been measured using a newexperimental technique based on a time projection chamber operating inultra-clean, deuterium-depleted hydrogen gas at 1 MPa pressure. The capturerate was obtained from the difference between the measured $\\mu^-$disappearance rate in hydrogen and the world average for the $\\mu^+$ decayrate. The target's low gas density of 1% compared to liquid hydrogen is key toavoiding uncertainties that arise from the formation of muonic molecules. Thecapture rate from the hyperfine singlet ground state of the $\\mu p$ atom ismeasured to be $\\Lambda_S=725.0 \\pm 17.4 s^{-1}$, from which the inducedpseudoscalar coupling of the nucleon, $g_P(q^2=-0.88 m_\\mu^2)=7.3 \\pm 1.1$, isextracted.

Cambridge, London and Brighton were top for cost-effective renting.The survey found that in Glasgow, Coventry and Birmingham renters could pay more than Â£100 a month than those with a mortgage.Renters were most likely to be better off than mortgage payers in pockets of the South, where the supply of homes is tight and house prices are high.Cambridge, London and Brighton are the top places where renting is cheaper than paying a mortgage, the research suggests.In Cambridge, the average monthly rent was found to be about Â£769 less than a mortgage payment.Lawrence Hall, a spokesman for Zoopla, said: \"Once you get past the initial fees that come with a house purchase, such as a deposit and stamp duty, our figures show that it can pay to try and get on the property ladder.\"On top of the enjoyment that can come with owning your property, buyers may also find themselves with more disposable income at the end of the month than those renting their homes.\"Particularly if you're in Scotland, northern England or in the West Midlands, taking the first step on to the ladder and sacrificing the flexibility of renting can be a much cheaper alternative.\"Zoopla's research assumed that someone buying a home had a 10% deposit and was paying a 25-year repayment mortgage with an interest rate of 4.5%.When the data was last analysed by Zoopla in October 2015, buying was cheaper than renting in just over one third of cities.",

        "We present a new, deep (V ~ 26) study of the Galactic globular cluster NGC2419 based on B,V,I time-series CCD photometry over about 10 years andextending beyond the cluster published tidal radius. We have identified 101variable stars of which 60 are new discoveries, doubling the known RR Lyraestars and including 12 SX Phoenicis stars. The average period of the RR Lyraestars (<Pab>=0.662 d, and <Pc>=0.366 d, for fundamental-mode -RRab- andfirst-overtone pulsators, respectively), and the position in theperiod-amplitude diagram both confirm that NGC 2419 is an Oosterhoff IIcluster. The average apparent magnitude of the RR Lyrae stars is <V>=20.31 +/-0.01 (sigma=0.06, 67 stars) and leads to the distance modulus (m-M)o=19.60 +/-0.05. The Color-Magnitude Diagram, reaching about 2.6 mag below the clusterturn-off, does not show clear evidence of multiple stellar populations. Clusterstars are found until r~ 10.5', and possibly as far as r~15', suggesting thatthe literature tidal radius might be underestimated. No extra-tidal structuresare clearly detected in the data. NGC 2419 has many blue stragglers and a wellpopulated horizontal branch extending from the RR Lyrae stars down to anextremely blue tail ending with the \"blue-hook\", for the first time recognizedin this cluster. The red giant branch is narrow ruling out significantmetallicity spreads. Our results seem to disfavor the interpretation of NGC2419 as either having an extragalactic origin or being the relict of a dwarfgalaxy tidally disrupted by the Milky Way.",
        "I came back from the pubs bathroom to the strangest scene. I would n' t have noticed if it was n' t for the completely off-topic comment by Jim. They were talking about our trip to Denmark last summer and I could n' t figure out how the Sahara desert was related to a tiny Scandinavian country. Chloe kept her eyes focused at my chair, just like Jim and Freddie, as if I still sat there. The conversation kept going but suddenly stopped with an awkward silence, followed by a unison laughter a couple of seconds later that really caught me off guard. They were still talking to me and with me, but I was n' t there, somehow. It was like I stepped out of the script of my own life. Would that mean I' m not me anymore? Can I not be seen? How do I get back into the script? Can I? If I' m still sitting in that chair, according to the script, what would happen if I did something else? I tried poking Jim' s arm. No reaction. He just sat there emerged deep in the conversation that now had transformed to an argument about what you put on hotdogs. Just to make sure I was n' t wrong about my theory, I took Freddie' s beer and emptied it in the bathroom sink. When I got back he had his hand raised to his mouth and head leaned back, as if he was drinking the same beer I just poured out. He was crazy about his beer, especially the finer Pilsners. If I sit back down in the chair now, do they notice what happened or not? I hinged back the tall glass to Freddie hand, and unhooked Chloe' s bra for good measure, and sat down. \" Dude, Jim, what the fuck!? I paid good money for that! Buy your own beer. \" Freddie gestured accusingly towards Jim, who seemed to have his attention somewhere else and Chloe just sat there with her bra unhooked as if nothing happened. Strange, I thought, she must have noticed that. I wanted to let her know but just as I was about to call her name I felt a slight poke on my arm, and a breath of wind. Her bra had hooked itself back on in an instant.",

        "For cellular biochemical reaction systems where the numbers of molecules issmall, significant noise is associated with chemical reaction events. Thismolecular noise can give rise to behavior that is very different from thepredictions of deterministic rate equation models. Unfortunately, there are fewanalytic methods for examining the qualitative behavior of stochastic systems.Here we describe such a method that extends deterministic analysis to includeleading-order corrections due to the molecular noise. The method allows thesteady-state behavior of the stochastic model to be easily computed,facilitates the mapping of stability phase diagrams that include stochasticeffects and reveals how model parameters affect noise susceptibility, in amanner not accessible to numerical simulation. By way of illustration weconsider two genetic circuits: a bistable positive-feedback loop and anegative-feedback oscillator. We find in the positive feedback circuit thattranslational activation leads to a far more stable system than transcriptionalcontrol. Conversely, in a negative-feedback loop triggered by apositive-feedback switch, the stochasticity of transcriptional control isharnessed to generate reproducible oscillations.",

        "In papers I and II in this series, we presented hydrodynamical simulations ofjet models with parameters representative of the symbiotic system MWC 560.These were simulations of a pulsed, initially underdense jet in a high densityambient medium. Since the pulsed emission of the jet creates internal shocksand since the jet velocity is very high, the jet bow shock and the internalshocks are heated to high temperatures and should therefore emit X-rayradiation. In this paper, we investigate in detail the X-ray properties of thejets in our models. We have focused our study on the total X-ray luminosity andits temporal variability, the resulting spectra and the spatial distribution ofthe emission. Temperature and density maps from our hydrodynamical simulationswith radiative cooling presented in the second paper are used together withemissivities calculated with the atomic database ATOMDB. The jets in our modelsshow extended and variable X-ray emission which can be characterized as a sumof hot and warm components with temperatures that are consistent withobservations of CH Cyg and R Aqr. The X-ray spectra of our model jets showemission line features which correspond to observed features in the spectra ofCH Cyg. The innermost parts of our pulsed jets show iron line emission in the6.4 - 6.7 keV range which may explain such emission from the central source inR Aqr. We conclude that MWC 560 should be detectable with Chandra orXMM-Newton, and such X-ray observations will provide crucial for understandingjets in symbiotic stars.",

        "A key idea in coding for the broadcast channel (BC) is binning, in which thetransmitter encode information by selecting a codeword from an appropriate bin(the messages are thus the bin indexes). This selection is normally done bysolving an appropriate (possibly difficult) combinatorial problem. Recently ithas been shown that binning for the Blackwell channel --a particular BC-- canbe done by iterative schemes based on Survey Propagation (SP). This method usesdecimation for SP and suffers a complexity of O(n^2). In this paper we proposea new variation of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, named Reinforced BPalgorithm, that turns BP into a solver. Our simulations show that this newalgorithm has complexity O(n log n). Using this new algorithm together with anon-linear coding scheme, we can efficiently achieve rates close to the borderof the capacity region of the Blackwell channel.",

I suppose some part of me wanted to believe it was n' t going to be like that. Once I saw the locket though, my heart sank. We were young when we fell in love. Old enough to know true love but young enough not to understand it. We spent every second we could together for years. We became so entwined that a life alone seemed impossible. But nothing lasts forever and one day it was over. To be entirely honest I was surprised when I arrived in Heaven. I did n' t expect there to be an after life, and I certainly did n' t expect to get into Heaven. I had done many things I was n' t proud of, things I truly regretted. But they explained to me how it all worked. Even though I did n' t believe in God, I had begged for forgiveness for my sins and done my best to be a good person. Then they told me about the serious rules, the rules that if broken would send you straight to Hell, regardless of everything else. Immediately I thought of my partner, the way we felt about each other, the promises we had made. Till death do us part was not enough, our love was beyond life and death. When I fished up that locket I knew in a heartbeat. My partner had committed an unforgivable sin. Suicide. The pain of being separated must have been unbearable. And in that same heartbeat I knew what I would do. Without even a second of thought I dived straight into the dark abyss. Clutching the locket tightly in my hand I descended into the nightmarish unknown, forgoing all the glory of Heaven. I knew only one thing, wherever my partner might go, I would follow, just as they had done for me.",

        "This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte CarloOptimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning(PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make fourcontributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broadclass of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new applicationdomain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduceimmediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithmfor blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BOproblem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first twocontributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contributionwe validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation andbagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO proceduresignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associatedvalues of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locationsare considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample locationinformation using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the samplelocations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides anadditional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.",

In the random anisotropy magnets the structuraldisorder is present in a form of local quenched anisotropy axes of randomorientation. When the anisotropy axes are randomly distributed along the edgesof the n-dimensional hypercube, asymptotical dynamical critical propertiescoincide with those of the random-site Ising model. However structural disordergives rise to considerable effects for non-asymptotic critical dynamics. Weinvestigate this phenomenon by a field-theoretical renormalization groupanalysis in the two-loop order. We study critical slowing down and obtainquantitative estimates for the effective and asymptotic critical exponents ofthe order parameter and scalar density. The results predict complex scenariosfor the effective critical exponent approaching an asymptotic regime.",

        "The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router linksmakes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order tokeep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred bythe collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluatingflow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly allcases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on aper-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on thecollected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significantfor some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relativeaccuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage ofsampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to theoriginal traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of theimpact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used inNetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of lossof monitoring detail.",

Dark green walls, dim and flickering lights above the sink mirror, and peeling paint on the wooden stall walls. I guess I' m in a run down bathroom. I quickly hopped to my feet and yanked open the door. I' m in a train station. Flickering lights and broken live electrical wires hung over the track, shooting sparks in every direction. As I walked, I could hear the hollow echo of the wooden platform below my feet. That' s when something caught my eye: a sticky note stuck to the bottom of my shoe. The note read, \" I' m sorry I left you, but they tried to use you as collateral on me. Run. Do n' t look for me. Just run for your life. \" Confused, i did n' t know what it meant. *Was this meant for me? * I thought. *Perhaps they meant it for someone else. * That' s when I remembered how I arrived there. My husband somehow made some bad deals with some bad people, and he owed them money for some service. He did n' t want to elaborate, he just tossed me in the car. Three black SUVs gave chase for what seemed like an hour, shooting at us with sub machine guns. The last thing I remember was an SUV t-boning our car as we raced through an intersection, and I blacked out. I do n' t know where he is, or what they have done to him. I hope he' s ok...",
        "We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps. Both were delicious, and I'm freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like! My flatbread was smothered in them, just the way I like it. The sashimi was nothing crazy, I liked the grilled pineapple with it. nnMy husband got himself a burger, the barbecue one, to be exact, and I had the wild mushroom pasta. I was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread, but the server raved about it, so I tried it anyway. nnMy husband enjoyed his burger, though he thought it could have been less salted. He was happy that the temperature was correct, also. nn The salad that came with my entree was.. . Ok. The blue cheese dressing was eh, the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy, and I actually spit out a crouton. It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil. I usually love croutons too. nnThe pasta was tasty, but almost too tasty, if that makes sense. Too many competing flavors. My husband was thrilled that they got \"al dente\" right, when he had a bite. I'd also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch, but there aren't a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat. nnOverall, I'd eat here again, and get the same apps and a lighter entree.",
        "We present a new analysis of the light curve for the secondary star in theeclipsing binary millisecond pulsar system PSR B1957+20. Combining previousdata and new data points at minimum from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have100% coverage in the R-band. We also have a number of new K_s-band data points,which we use to constrain the infrared magnitude of the system. We model thiswith the Eclipsing Light Curve code (ELC). From the modelling with the ELC codewe obtain colour information about the secondary at minimum light in BVRI andK. For our best fit model we are able to constrain the system inclination to 65+/- 2 degrees for pulsar masses ranging from 1.3 -- 1.9 M_sun. The pulsar massis unconstrained. We also find that the secondary star is not filling its Rochelobe. The temperature of the un-irradiated side of the companion is inagreement with previous estimates and we find that the observed temperaturegradient across the secondary star is physically sustainable.",
        "Stereoscopic spectral imaging is an observing technique that affords rapidacquisition of limited spectral information over an entire image planesimultaneously. Light from a telescope is dispersed into multiple spectralorders, which are imaged separately, and two or more of the dispersed imagesare combined using an analogy between the (x,y,\\lambda) spectral data space andconventional (x,y,z) three-space. Because no photons are deliberately destroyedduring image acquisition, the technique is much more photon-efficient in someobserving regimes than existing techniques such as scanned-filtergraph orscanned-slit spectral imaging. Hybrid differential stereoscopy, which uses acombination of conventional cross-correlation stereoscopy and linearapproximation theory to extract the central wavelength of a spectral line, hasbeen used to produce solar Stokes-V (line-of-sight) magnetograms in the 617.34nm Fe I line, and more sophisticated inversion techniques are currently beingused to derive Doppler and line separation data from EUV images of the solarcorona collected in the neighboring lines of He-II and Si-XI at 30.4 nm. Inthis paper we develop an analytic a priori treatment of noise in the line shiftsignal derived from hybrid differential stereoscopy. We use the analysis toestimate the noise level and measurement precision in a high resolution solarmagnetograph based on stereoscopic spectral imaging, compare those estimates toa test observation made in 2003, and discuss implications for futureinstruments.",

        "Photonic molecules, named by analogy with chemical molecules, are clusters ofclosely located electromagnetically interacting microcavities or \"photonicatoms\". As two or several microcavities are brought close together, theiroptical modes interact, and a rich spectrum of photonic molecule supermodesemerges, which depends both on geometrical and material properties ofindividual cavities and on their mutual interactions. Here, we discuss ways ofcontrollable manipulation of photonic molecule supermodes, which improve or addnew functionalities to microcavity-based optical components. We present severaloptimally-tuned photonic molecule designs for lowering thresholds ofsemiconductor microlasers, producing directional light emission, enhancingsensitivity of microcavity-based bio(chemical)sensors, and optimizingelectromagnetic energy transfer around bends of coupled-cavity waveguides.Photonic molecules composed of identical microcavities as well as ofmicrocavities with various degrees of size or material detuning are discussed.Microwave experiments on scaled photonic molecule structures are currentlyunder way to confirm our theoretical predictions.",
        "From photometric observations of elliptical galaxies, among which are bothradio galaxies and radio-quiet objects, an investigation was carried out of therelationship `redshift -- age of the stellar system' $(\\Delta z/\\Delta t)$. Bymeans of this relationship cosmological parameters $H(z)$ and $\\Omega_\\Lambda$are estimated. Ages of stellar systems are determined within the framework ofevolution models of synthetic spectra PEGASE and GISSEL. This approach can beconsidered as time study of objects of the early Universe independent of othercosmological models. Construction of a pooled sample is described, containing220 objects from different populations of elliptical galaxies, for which ananalysis of the upper limit of the age of formation of a stellar system wasperformed. These data were used to estimate the boundaries of determination ofthe cosmological parameters $H_0$ and $\\Lambda$--term: $H_0=72\\pm10$ and$\\Omega_\\Lambda=0.8\\pm0.1$ in the model GISSEL and $H_0=53\\pm10$, and$\\Omega_\\Lambda=0.8\\pm0.1$ in the model PEGASE.",

It turns out there are two Monro Muffler locations on Penn Ave and no employee at either shop thought to bring this up (then, or at any point), as I had called the wrong location (I found out days later). nnService: nThey took my car in anyway and said \"they'd get to it tomorrow\", well tomorrow became the next day and the day after.. . nnGot a call that the mufflers I bought for the car turned out to be the wrong ones so I called around, tracked down the right ones, and dropped the correct ones off there within two hours of the call. nnQuality of work: nAll in all it took a week for them to get the work done and I was under the impression they would be welding the whole system together. It turns out they just use clamps and bolt stuff together. I asked them to make me some tail pipes for me with bends over the rear axle and they couldn't do it with 2. 5\" pipe, turns out they are incapable of bending anything over 2\" pipes there. Instead we agreed it would be easiest for them and cheapest to install short turndown pipes. So really it wasn't a terribly difficult job to be done. nnOverall impression: nI gave two stars instead of one because they didn't actually break anything or lose my car or burn it down or anything. Pricing came in just over what we had agreed on because of the addition of the turndown pipes. I could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself.",
        "We carry out and analyze new multi-color photometry of the Galactic globularcluster (GC) M75 in UBVI and focus on the brighter sequences of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), with particular emphasis on their location in U-basedCMD. Specifically, we study the level both of the horizontal (HB) and red giantbranches (RGB) relative to the main-sequence turnoff (TO) in the U magnitude.Along with the presented photometry of M75, we use our collection ofphotometric data on GCs belonging to the metal-poor range, [Fe/H]zw<-1.1 dex,obtained from observations with different equipment, but calibrated by standardstars situated in the observed cluster fields. We confirm our earlier finding,and extend it to a larger magnitude range.We demonstrate that DeltaU_{TO}^{BHB}expressing the difference in U magnitude between the TO point and the level ofthe blue HB, near its red boundary, of the metal-poor GCs observed with theEMMI camera of the NTT/ESO telescope is about 0.4-0.5 mag smaller as comparedto GCs observed with the 100\" telescope and 1.3 m Warsaw telescope of the LasCampanas Observatory. At the same time, Delta U_{TO}^{RGB}, the difference in Umagnitude between the TO and RGB inflection (brightest) points, does not showsuch an apparent dependence on the characteristics of U filters used, but itdepends on cluster metallicity. We have shown, for the first time, thedependence of the parameter DeltaU_{TO}^{RGB} on [Fe/H] and have estimated itsanalytical expression, by assuming a linear relation between the parameter andmetallicity. Its slope, Delta U_{TO}^{RGB}/Delta [Fe/H]~1.2 mag/dex, is approx.a factor of two steeper than that of the dependence of the RGB bump position inthe V magnitude on metallicity. The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) clump andfeatures of the RGB luminosity function (LF) of M75 are also discussed.",
        "nnWhenever possible, I purchase parts and services from local dealerships. Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses. nnThat said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter. nnI called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta. My Jetta has the 1. 9L BRM Diesel motor (\"PD\" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil. VW mandates that you use their 505. 01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor. Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty. nnSo imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \"any old oil\" while on the phone. When I tried to correct him and request the 505. 01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved. nnI then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter. I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused. A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer. nnSo, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership. I'm sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and I was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25).",
        "We develop distributed algorithms to allocate resources in multi-hop wirelessnetworks with the aim of minimizing total cost. In order to observe thefundamental duplexing constraint that co-located transmitters and receiverscannot operate simultaneously on the same frequency band, we first devise aspectrum allocation scheme that divides the whole spectrum into multiplesub-bands and activates conflict-free links on each sub-band. We show that theminimum number of required sub-bands grows asymptotically at a logarithmic ratewith the chromatic number of network connectivity graph. A simple distributedand asynchronous algorithm is developed to feasibly activate links on theavailable sub-bands. Given a feasible spectrum allocation, we then designnode-based distributed algorithms for optimally controlling the transmissionpowers on active links for each sub-band, jointly with traffic routes and userinput rates in response to channel states and traffic demands. We show thatunder specified conditions, the algorithms asymptotically converge to theoptimal operating point.",

But consistently, once the waiters figure out who's paying, if it's not you, forget it. nnBut I guess what the Aquavina staff can't figure out is, if they treat you badly when you're not paying, you won't return when it's your turn to pick up the tab. And I've had such consistently mediocre to bad service here, that will never happen. nnI once waited an hour for a drink and chips that never came, surrounded by a dozen people eating and drinking. What a lovely time. nnThat same night, asking the \"greeter\" at the door to help find my party drew nothing but a blank stare, and I had to wander the place looking for them. nnIt's not always THAT bad, but it's never met expectations. nnFor the record: I've had lunch and attended social get-togethers there. It's been about two years since I've been there. The very last time I went, service was tolerable.",

        "Aims:The Gaia astrometric survey mission will, as a consequence of itsscanning law, obtain low resolution optical (330-1000 nm) spectrophotometry ofseveral million unresolved galaxies brighter than V=22. We present the firststeps in a project to design and implement a classification system for thesedata. The goal is both to determine morphological classes and to estimateintrinsic astrophysical parameters via synthetic templates. Here we describe(1) a new library of synthetic galaxy spectra, and (2) first results ofclassification and parametrization experiments using simulated Gaiaspectrophotometry of this library. Methods:We have created a large grid ofsynthetic galaxy spectra using the PEGASE.2 code, which is based on galaxyevolution models that take into account metallicity evolution, extinctioncorrection, emission lines (with stellar spectra based on the BaSeL library).Our classification and regression models are Support Vector Machines (SVMs),which are kernel-based nonlinear estimators. Results:We produce a basic libraryof about 4000 zero redshift galaxy spectra covering the main Hubble types overwavelength range 250 to 1050 nm at a sampling of 1 nm or less. It is computedon a regular grid of four key astrophysical parameters for each type and forintermediate random values of the same parameters. An extended libraryreproduces this at a series of redshifts. Initial results from the SVMclassifiers and parametrizers are promising, indicating that Hubble types canbe reliably predicted and several parameters estimated with low bias andvariance. Comparing the colours of our synthetic library with Sloan Digital SkySurvey (SDSS) spectra we find good agreement over the full range of Hubbletypes and parameters.",
        "The MuCap experiment is a high-precision measurement of the rate for thebasic electroweak process of muon capture, mu- + p -> n + nu . The experimentalapproach is based on an active target consisting of a time projection chamber(TPC) operating with pure hydrogen gas. The hydrogen has to be kept extremelypure and at a stable pressure. A Circulating Hydrogen Ultrahigh PurificationSystem was designed at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute (PNPI) tocontinuously clean the hydrogen from impurities. The system is based on anadsorption cryopump to stimulate the hydrogen flow and on a cold adsorbent forthe hydrogen cleaning. It was installed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in2004 and performed reliably during three experiment runs. During several monthslong operating periods the system maintained the hydrogen purity in thedetector on the level of 20 ppb for moisture, which is the main contaminant,and of better than 7 ppb and 5 ppb for nitrogen and oxygen, respectively. Thepressure inside the TPC was stabilized to within 0.024% of 10 bar at a hydrogenflow rate of 3 standard liters per minute.",

In a statement on Monday, it agreed to \"take further significant measures including sanctions\" to force North Korea to end its \"highly destabilising behaviour\".The spike in tensions comes with a new president in South Korea.

If yes, theseprocesses, as Fig. 3 shows very clearly, are not stationary, and the pressuredifference (i.e., the signal) quickly decays to zero.

The results of Menezes and Barabasi arestrictly only valid for stationary time series, and they cannot be applied atall in this case.\" We agree with this insightful comment that our data are notstationary and the method adopted in our manuscript does not apply.

I remember before all these Hitler Trials I would work on my carpentry in my shed while my husband slaved over this DIY time machine kit. It took him a few years to get the machine user-friendly enough to meet council standards and by that time, time machines were becoming the common method of transportation. People made a sport out of it, a manhunt to an extent where everyone competing aimed to kill Hitler in the most difficult and creative way possible. My husband and I drafted this huge plan and put it in place at the beginning of last year. First of all, my husband and I decided to have a temporary marriage truce so I could effectively kill Hitler meaning we divorced and would remarry on my return. We went to the verification offices, took the tests, and I was probed in the eye so they could monitor my progress and verify the kill as well as the method. I entered our machine that was docked at the office and I travelled back in time before World War II.

        "In this paper, the study of the gravitational collapse of cylindricallydistributed two perfect fluid system has been carried out. It is assumed thatthe collapsing speeds of the two fluids are very large. We explore thiscondition by using the high-speed approximation scheme. There arise two cases,i.e., bounded and vanishing of the ratios of the pressures with densities oftwo fluids given by $c_s, d_s$. It is shown that the high-speed approximationscheme breaks down by non-zero pressures $p_1, p_2$ when $c_s, d_s$ are boundedbelow by some positive constants. The failure of the high-speed approximationscheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests theuncertainity on the evolution at and after this time. In the bounded case, thenaked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical twoperfect fluids. For the vanishing case, if a linear equation of state is used,the high-speed collapse does not break down by the effects of the pressures andconsequently a naked singularity forms. This work provides the generalisationof the results already given by Nakao and Morisawa [1] for the perfect fluid.",

        "A release of multicolor broad band (BVRI) photometry for a subsample of 44isolated spirals drawn from the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (CIG) ispresented. Total magnitudes and colors at various circular apertures, as wellas some global structural/morphological parameters are estimated. Morphology isreevaluated through optical and sharp/filtered R band images, (B-I) color indexmaps, and archive near-IR JHK images from the Two-Micron Survey. The CASstructural parameters (Concentration, Asymmetry, and Clumpiness) werecalculated from the images in each one of the bands. The fraction of galaxieswith well identified optical/near-IR bars (SB) is 63%, while a 17% more showsevidence of weak or suspected bars (SAB). The sample average value of themaximum bar ellipticity is 0.4. Half of the galaxies in the sample shows rings.We identify two candidates for isolated galaxies with disturbed morphology. Thestructural CAS parameters change with the observed band, and the tendenciesthey follow with the morphological type and global color are more evident inthe redder bands. In any band, the major difference between our isolatedspirals and a sample of interacting spirals is revealed in the A-S plane. Adeep and uniformly observed sample of isolated galaxies is intended for variouspurposes including (i) comparative studies of environmental effects, (ii)confronting model predictions of galaxy evolution and (iii) evaluating thechange of galaxy properties with redshift.",
        "We report on a theoretical derivation of the electronic dielectric responseof semiconductor nanocrystals using a tight-binding framework. Extending to thenanoscale the Hanke and Sham approach [Phys. Rev. B 12, 4501 (1975)] developedfor bulk semiconductors, we show how local field effects can be included in thestudy of confined systems. A great advantage of this scheme is that of beingformulated in terms of localized orbitals and thus it requires very fewcomputational resources and times. Applications to the optical and screeningproperties of semiconductor nanocrystals are presented here and discussed.Results concerning the absorption cross section, the static polarizability andthe screening function of InAs (direct gap) and Si (indirect gap) nanocrystalscompare well to both first principles results and experimental data. We alsoshow that the present scheme allows us to easily go beyond the continuumdielectric model, based on the Clausius-Mossotti equation, which is frequentlyused to include the nanocrystal surface polarization. Our calculations indicatethat the continuum dielectric model, used in conjunction with a size dependentdielectric constant, underestimates the nanocrystal polarizability, leading toexceedingly strong surface polarization fields.",
        "Of course, I'm no expert on Chinese food. I have heard people rave about Italian restaurants that I, as an Italian, find lacking; so I suspect that someone of Chinese ancestry might think First Wok falls short. Take that as a caveat. Anyway, I like their egg rolls and boiled dumplings. The crab rangoons don't impress. Their hot and sour soup is good. Gentle kick to it. I often get Pork Lo Mein and enjoy that. Servings are ample. The General Tsao Chicken is good, as are all the entrees I have tried. The usual unappetizing photos of their dishes adorn the wall. I often wonder about those photos. A friend living in Taiwan sent me a cookbook that was popular there and it contained the same quality photos of the food. Curious. The menu lists a plethora of items and the wall has posted another list of dozens of entrees. What these all are escapes me and there is often a language barrier when asking for an explanation. Sometimes I feel adventurous and plan to order something I never had before but I always end up going with something familiar. For a sit-down dinner, I prefer Rainbow Gardens on Neil Street, but for a quick and satisfying Chinese dinner, First Wok should not disappoint.",
        "After getting stuck in Charlotte due to weather in Chicago, we were able to book this hotel for our unexpected stay. As a nursing mother I was hoping for a fridge in my room, however a pageant taking place at the hotel meant all were taken. The staff were nice enough to let me keep some things in the employee fridge which I really appreciated. nnThe beds are very comfortable so you can get a good night's sleep. nnThe food at the main restaurant/bar was decent with very large portions. In typical southern style, it was covered in sauce(s) but good enough. nnThe not so good:  The main picture posted on Yelp (and on SPG. com) leads you to believe the hotel is nicer than it actually is. The hotel is very average and does not appear to have been significantly updated in the last 10-15 years (except for the beds which were quite nice). nnThe website advertising a 24-hour on-demand shuttle, however the on-demand part is only when being picked up from the airport not to be dropped off (which would have been helpful for them to mention at check-in). There were 3-5 of us that were ready to go at 5: 45am (because our flight departed at 6: 50am) but were told that we had to wait until 6am because it only leaves on the half hour. They also would not let us ride with an earlier van that carried crew members and informed us that a taxi would take 15-20 minutes to call. Overall, seemed frustrating as to why they could not have a van make a trip to the airport when there are 5 people waiting to go. nnI'm not sure if this is an SPG systematic problem or not, but the hotel charged me for internet on my bill and I had to ask to have it taken off (since I'm a platinum member). This has happened at several hotels, and I feel they are trying to pass through charges and hoping that guests don't notice.",

I know that my path is necessary, and that all the evil I' ve done has a purpose, a goal, an eventual result that will justify my actions... But when you do the wrong thing for the right reasons long enough, it seems you can justify anything. Six million people died with the first bomb. It was an improvised nuclear explosive, funded with money stolen from bank accounts across the globe. Money I personally oversaw the transfer of, a bomb I ordered the construction and detonation of, six million lives I took with my own ideas, such are the sins I will carry with me along this road.

Under my direction, eventually my organization will gain total authority over every man, woman and child alive. The sheer technological and logistical costs will be unheard of in history. I will then use my power to administer a test to all humanity, and kill any who fail. 2. 3 billion people, of which over sixty percent will be completely innocent, their only crime to register a false positive.

        "[Abridged] We present an analysis of the scaling relations between X-rayproperties and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) parameters for a sample of 24 X-rayluminous galaxy clusters observed with Chandra and with measured SZ effect.These objects are in the redshift range 0.14--0.82 and have X-ray bolometricluminosity L>10^45 erg/s. We perform a spatially resolved spectral analysis andrecover the density, temperature and pressure profiles of the ICM, just relyingon the spherical symmetry of the cluster and the hydrostatic equilibriumhypothesis. We observe that the correlations among X-ray quantities only are inagreement with previous results obtained for samples of high-z X-ray luminousgalaxy clusters. On the relations involving SZ quantities, we obtain that theycorrelate with the gas temperature with a logarithmic slope significantlylarger than the predicted value from the self-similar model. The measuredscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxyof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities likeluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tensionbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.gas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of theICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the mostsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from theself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations. When theslope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show anegative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshifthas lower both X-ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than theexpectations from self-similar model.",
        "Protein-DNA complexes with loops play a fundamental role in a wide variety ofcellular processes, ranging from the regulation of DNA transcription totelomere maintenance. As ubiquitous as they are, their precise in vivoproperties and their integration into the cellular function still remainlargely unexplored. Here, we present a multilevel approach that efficientlyconnects in both directions molecular properties with cell physiology and useit to characterize the molecular properties of the looped DNA-lac repressorcomplex while functioning in vivo. The properties we uncover include thepresence of two representative conformations of the complex, the stabilizationof one conformation by DNA architectural proteins, and precise values of theunderlying twisting elastic constants and bending free energies. Incorporationof all this molecular information into gene-regulation models reveals anunprecedented versatility of looped DNA-protein complexes at shaping theproperties of gene expression.",
        "We use photometric and spectroscopic observations of the detached eclipsingbinary V209 omega Cen to derive the masses, radii, and luminosities of thecomponent stars. The system exhibits total eclipses and, based on the measuredsystemic velocity and the derived distance, is a member of the globular clusteromega Cen. We obtain 0.945 +/- 0.043 Msun, 0.983 +/- 0.015 Rsun and 6.68 +/-0.88 Lsun for the cooler, but larger and more luminous primary component. Thesecondary component has 0.144 +/- 0.008 Msun, 0.425 +/- 0.008 Rsun and 2.26 +/-0.28 Lsun. The effective temperatures are estimated at 9370 K for the primaryand at 10866 K for the secondary. On the color-magnitude diagram of thecluster, the primary component occupies a position between the tip of the bluestraggler region and the extended horizontal branch while the secondarycomponent is located close to the red border of the area occupied by hotsubdwarfs. However, its radius is too large and its effective temperature istoo low for it to be an sdB star. We propose a scenario leading to theformation of a system with such unusual properties with the primary component``re-born'' from a former white dwarf which accreted a new envelope throughmass transfer from its companion. The secondary star has lost most of itsenvelope while starting its ascent onto the sub-giant branch. It failed toignite helium in its core and is currently powered by a hydrogen burning shell.",

        "In mesoscopic two-gap superconductors with sizes of the order of thecoherence length noncomposite vortices are found to be thermodynamically stablein a large domain of the $T - H$ phase diagram. In these phases the vortexcores of one condensate are spatially separated from the other condensate ones,and their respective distributions can adopt distinct symmetries. Theappearance of these vortex phases is caused by a non-negligible effect of theboundary of the sample on the superconducting order parameter and representstherefore a genuine mesoscopic effect. For low values of interband Josephsoncoupling vortex patterns with $L_1 \\neq L_2$ can arise in addition to thephases with $L_1 =L_2$, where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are total vorticities in the twocondensates.

        "Supermassive black hole (BH) masses (MBH) are strongly correlated with galaxystellar bulge masses (Mbulge) and there are several ideas to explain the originof this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers fromconsiderations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linearBH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of howprimordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass functiondeclines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relationis a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relationbecause of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency forgalaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, anda convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. Acurious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges areformed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH wouldcorrelate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of strongercentral-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if someother physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulgerelationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, randommerging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen ratherthan weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalizedto other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclearobjects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.",

        "It was for a late lunch (about 2: 00 p. m. when we arrived). We were greeted by the hostess who took us to our table (which was in the trolley car). It's a visually interesting place to dine. However, our chairs were rickety and appeared ready to collapse. nnThe restaurant was mostly empty (which was not a surprise as we got there after the prime lunch hour but before dinner). And yet although there wasn't a lot of other customers there all vying for the attention of the servers, it took an unusually long time for our waitress to arrive at our table. (A pattern which continued throughout the duration of our stay). nnOn the back of the menu, there is a section for lunch entrees. I ordered the \"Amazing 15 Layer Lasagne\".

Again, there is ONE menu, and the pack of the menu has the lunch section. It reads (until 3: 00 p. m. ). What I failed to see (because it's in fine print) is the part where they only offer lunch prices Monday through Friday. Really? REALLY? Are you kidding me? That's B. S., no matter how you view it. At no time did either the hostess or the waitress bother to explain to us up front that the lunch pricing wasn't in effect. nnI HATE being ripped off.

        "The physical interpretation of the spectral line polarization produced by thejoint action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects offers a unique opportunity toobtain empirical information about hidden aspects of solar and stellarmagnetism. To this end, it is important to achieve a complete understanding ofthe sensitivity of the emergent spectral line polarization to the presence of amagnetic field. Here we present a detailed theoretical investigation on therole of resonance scattering and magnetic fields on the polarization signals ofthe Ba II D1 and D2 lines of the Fraunhofer spectrum, respectively at 4934 \\AA\\and 4554 \\AA. We adopt a three-level model of Ba II, and we take into accountthe hyperfine structure that is shown by the $^{135}$Ba and $^{137}$Baisotopes. Despite of their relatively small abundance (18%), the contributioncoming from these two isotopes is indeed fundamental for the interpretation ofthe polarization signals observed in these lines. We consider an optically thinslab model, through which we can investigate in a rigorous way the essentialphysical mechanisms involved (resonance polarization, Zeeman, Paschen-Back andHanle effects), avoiding complications due to radiative transfer effects. Weassume the slab to be illuminated from below by the photospheric solarcontinuum radiation field, and we investigate the radiation scattered at 90degrees, both in the absence and in the presence of magnetic fields,deterministic and microturbulent. We show in particular the existence of adifferential magnetic sensitivity of the three-peak Q/I profile that isobserved in the D2 line in quiet regions close to the solar limb, which is ofgreat interest for magnetic field diagnostics.",
        "It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has beenexpressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlinwave function at filling factor $\\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and thePfaffian wave function at $\\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a generalscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformalfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonicvertex operators, $P_{\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electronoperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identicalto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave functionhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almostidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactlyrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFTcorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFTrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rmth}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- andquasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge andstatistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs thatdescribe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's generalclassification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest ageneral procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for otherfractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at fillingfractions not contained in the principal Jain series.",

And I have got to say, they have some pretty good ones. nnThus far, I have tried three different kinds. The Caribbean Creepers were like eating a jerk chicken wing, but they were just a little too different for me. The medium garlic were pretty good, but the best I have had, by far, are the Cajun Garlic. They are the perfect level of spiciness, not too spicy but plenty of flavor. nnI have tried some of their other things here too. Their bacon cheese fries were kind of 'meh' when I had them; they were pretty skimpy on the cheese and bacon. Their pizza was pretty decent. We had the Masterpiece, had a lot of good toppings. Still, I am not a huge fan of New York-style pizza (I originate from the Midwest, and am quite partial toward Chicago-style or deep dish), but it was pretty standard for pizza. nnService has been ok here. I have never had bad service, so that is definitely a plus. They do have a decent amount of seating too, and it's not overly crowded in there. nnI plan to try a few more things on their menu, and that definitely includes other styles of their wings.

And Mom raises a hand, starts to slap her, and I jump in. I push my sister away and take it for her. She' s shocked, eyes wide. There' s an angry red mark on my cheek. This is the war we fought. She' s sobbing into a pillow. Mom said this one thing, this one cruel hurtful thing. \" She expects us to love her, even though she' s a shitty person! \" And she went quiet at that. Quiet and solemn and stoic. Staring ahead. Dad said that that' s going overboard. I said nothing. I wish I did now. But she' s sobbing now. So hard. It' s muffled. Mom and Dad ca n' t hear her. Thank God. I rub her back, I kiss her head. All of these comments chip away slowly at her. This is the war we fought. She' s crying in front of the office now. Her teacher comes by, notices.

        "The unbinding process of a protein-ligand complex of major biologicalinterest was investigated by means of a computational approach at atomisticclassical mechanical level. An energy minimisation-based technique was used todetermine the dissociation paths of the system by probing only a relevant setof generalized coordinates. The complex problem was reduced to alow-dimensional scanning along a selected distance between the protein and theligand. Orientational coordinates of the escaping fragment (the ligand) werealso assessed in order to further characterise the unbinding. Solvent effectswere accounted for by means of the Poisson--Boltzmann continuum model. Thecorresponding dissociation time was derived from the calculated barrier height,in compliance with the experimentally reported Arrhenius-like behaviour. Thecomputed results are in good agreement with the available experimental data.",
        "Eshu. A tiny moon named for a trickster god because of it' s eccentric orbit around the gas giant Olodumare. It' s a desert moon, the kind of rock no one would bother with, usually. Except for the two factors. 1. Oludumare passes near a wormhole to Tau Ceti on its orbit, which of course is colonized. 2. Eshu is the perfect size that ships can land and take off with minimal fuel cost, but it is spinning fast enough to produce artificial gravity. In its early history, it was a hide out for criminals and political dissidents. But once the inner planet of Alye was terraformed and colonized, Alye became the jumping off point to Tau Ceti and therefore to the rest of civilized space. Nowadays Eshu has a Federation governor who makes sure the undesirables stay away, the walls stay scrubbed white, and the bottom line balances out.

They paid €1,000 as a deposit, but consumed €10,000 ($10,600; £8,600) worth of food and drink.\"There were 160 of them and they all disappeared. Suddenly.

Ok yes, the menu indicates this a \"spicy\" dish, but it didn't indicate its high degree of suck. nnUnfortunately on this particular visit we didn't get a hot waitress. Instead we got a disenchanted guy who apparently didn't want a very big tip.

You would think something with \"ember\" in its name would emit a bit of warmth in its ambiance. The menu seemed a little limited, and we were starving and I was getting cranky so we actually opted for the bar for appetizers while we decided what to do. I highly recommend the \"10\" sampler, which included small bites of rare ahi, goat cheese quesadilla, buffalo wings, hummus and smoked salmon. Great deal for $14. J got a delicious Kobe burger and we relaxed in the spacious bar, and soaked in the cocktail hour jazz piano. Room service was just okay. The staff was all very pleasant with the exception of the disinterested waiter in the bar; strangest service I may have ever encountered. I think maybe he was trying to pull off some sort of NYC attitude schtick in Charlotte. It was amusing at least. Nice stay, nice location. No MSNBC, this and the waiter cost them a star.",

As I looked up at the board, four burly men clad in dark attire burst in through the door, wearing balaclavas and wielding various guns. Time seemed to freeze. Some of my classmates screamed. Some cried. Some did n' t react at all. My teacher shouted at the men but got out no more than two unintelligible words before one of them took aim with their pistol and doubletapped him in the head. The class started panicking. Some ran. Some froze. I stared in shock at the sight of my teacher' s brains spilling out all over the floor. He was dead. As my adrenaline kicked in, I sprang up and frantically made a beeline for the door. More gunshots erupted as several of my classmates piled to the floor. I screamed and charged straight at one of the attackers. He raised his assault rifle and brought the stock of the gun crashing down onto the back of my head. I crumpled to the ground, defeated. More gunshots erupted as I saw another one of my classmates drop to the floor. Bodies lay around me as I gradually faded out of consciousness. The next time I woke up was inside a speeding van. My hands were cuffed behind my back and a rag was over my eyes. I could n' t see anything. Then, as my movement was no doubt detected, the rag was ripped off my face. A man was watching me closely. He was close to me. Too close. I could smell his breath as he spoke a few menacing words to me, that chilled me to the bone. \" You have started a war. \" He smiled widely, revealing a shabby set of teeth. Why me?",

        "Tai Le, 21, and Duc Nguyen, 36, originally from Vietnam, but with an address at Church Street in Portadown, both face six charges.They include being concerned in the supply of a class B controlled drug and cultivating cannabis.They are also accused of having a class B drug with intent to supply and dishonestly diverting electricity.Mr Le and Mr Nguyen were arrested and charged after police searched a house in Church Street.Officers initially believed the cannabis was worth £500,000, however following the completion of searches the figure is now thought to be in the region of £750,000 to £1m.\"A number of plants, cultivation equipment and associated items have been removed for further examination,\" Det Ch Insp Stephen Wright told the court.\"Officers on patrol in this area noticed a smell of cannabis and their subsequent enquiries led them to this cannabis factory.\"Neither Mr Le nor Mr Nguyen applied for bail.

        "nThis place is pretty bare bones, CASH ONLY, and it looks like it might not have been thoroughly cleaned since it was built. We asked for separate checks (we were here for a conference and each has an expense account to submit) and the waitress didn't seem too happy about our request. I might add that we were the only people in the restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday. But I digress, you wanted to know about the food, didn't you? nIt was ALL greasy. The crab cakes were possibly the most dense foodstuff I've ever seen. The Fish 'n chips were like nuggets, the fried sampler was ENORMOUS and one of our guys ordered the Monster fish sandwich, yup, it was monster all right. only about 1/3 of it fit on the bun. nOverall it was just bland sea food. no one was upset at the choice, but no one was raving about it either.",
        "The decor is cool and varied and the place itself is quite large. There is free parking which is nice, but parking was hard to find on a Friday night. We had a semi-large party (about 15-20 of us) and it took us well over 30 minutes to get seated. Clearly they knew we were coming, so it shouldn't have been a surprised to them. nnOnce we were finally seated, it took 30 minutes from ordering our drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) to actually getting them to the table. We still hadn't even looked at a menu when the drinks finally did arrive. From there the service picked up slightly and we were presented with warm bread, garlic butter (decent) and salad. I dislike iceburg lettuce so this was meh. Given that we were a large party, obviously we were given a limited menu selection. I ordered \"The Incredible 15 Layer Lasagna\" and it certainly wasn't 15 layers, unless you count the loads of marinara on top as, say, 10 layers. My cousin ordered the same thing and ended up with a piece of chicken on his plate, don't ask me why. The lasagna was okay, but I've had better from a Stouffer's frozen meal. nnMoving onto dessert, I ordered the tiramisu. Might as well just call it white cake with \"espresso\" drizzled on top. It was still slightly frozen too. No thanks. nnFrom start to finish it took us over 3 hours to get our entire meal. Understandably, we weren't a small table of four so it will take longer, but it shouldn't have taken that long. Since we were there for a significant amount of time, we were able to observe what other's were eating/doing while we were waiting. Nearly everyone had enough leftover portions to take home and feed themselves at least once if not twice more. Good value as a customer, bad for a business who is trying to make money. nnAll in all, if you're looking for some good authentic Italian, I would recommend going elsewhere.",
        "The silence was the first thing she noticed as she strode in, usually her roommate was so happy, so loud, so.. annoying. It was what she had come to dread about heading home, what should have been a comforting reprieve from her lessons was what pushed her to do more work and stay as far from home as possible. Her footsteps echoed through the hall, anticipating the likely prank and how best to avoid it; a bucket on a door? a weakened floorboard? something new? But no, nothing happened as of yet, the only oddity being a game boy on the floor. She ambled towards her room and tentatively pushed his door open, jumping back when it creaked and shaking her head, embarrassed at her own fear. He was probably just out, partying, or *socialising*. But a thought nagged at her as lay on her bed, a thought she could n' t quite place, but yet still caused her trouble. She rose, and started to stride towards the kitchen, an easy escape from anxiety. But, passing her roommates room, a whimper reached her ears, a whimper so feeble and miserable that it would have moved the heart of the most impassive politician. As she entered the room, the whimper stopped, the silence settling like a smog. A shaking head was visible behind his bedside dresser, and as she stepped towards him it stiffened, as still as the silence. He glanced at her as she passed the corner of the bed and visibly relaxed before motioning violently for her to get down, mouthing indecipherable words, but the meaning was discernible, to hide, or go. As her mind sifted through the confusion of what could possibly be happening, the front door creaked open, and her roommate stopped, still as jock concentrating on math. Footsteps advanced in a perfectly even pattern, and a white-gloved hand grabbed the frame of the doorway, a sinister voice shattering the silence, her heart stopping for a moment. \" It' s a me, Mario! \"",
        "The Galactic center (GC) is a dense and chaotic region filled with unusualsources, such as intense star forming regions, dense star clusters, nonthermalradio filaments, and a massive black hole. The proximity of the GC region makesit an ideal place to study the unusual processes that tend to manifestthemselves in Galactic nuclei. This thesis uses single-dish and interferometricradio continuum, radio recombination line, polarized radio continuum, andmid-IR observations to study the wide variety of physical processes seen in theGC region on physical scales from 0.1 to 100 parsecs. These observationsprovide one of the most sensitive studies of the radio continuum emission inthe central 500 parsecs. I also study the properties of nonthermal radiofilaments, which can constrain their origin and the structure of the magneticfield in the GC region.  The presence of massive star clusters and a massive black hole suggest thatstarburst and AGN phenomena can manifest themselves in our Galaxy. This thesisexplores this possibility by studying a 150-pc-tall, shell-like structurecalled the Galactic center lobe (GCL). Our observations examine the spectralindex, dust emission, polarized continuum emission, and ionized gas throughoutthe GCL. I find strong evidence supporting the idea that the GCL is a truethree-dimensional shell located in the GC region with nested layers of ionized,magnetized, and mid-IR--emitting components. I compare the physical conditionsof the GCL to proposed models for its origin and find best agreement withstarburst outflows seen in other galaxies, yet consistent with the currentlyobserved pressure and star formation rate in the central tens of parsecs of ourGalaxy.

Another £4m will be spent on improving access to community care.In all, 64 primary care \"clusters\" have been set up across Wales of GP practices working with pharmacists, dentists, optometrists, therapists, nurses and healthcare workers.They will run a primary care support team to provide locum cover or offer training and advice to manage local service pressures among other things.\"We are shifting focus from hospital-based care to improving population health and community-based care,\" said Mr Drakeford.",

        "The first-order eikonal approximation is frequently adopted in interpretingthe results of $A(e,e'p)$ measurements. Glauber calculations, for example,typically adopt the first-order eikonal approximation.

The numerical calculations are performedwithin the relativistic optical model eikonal approximation. The nucleartransparency results indicate that the effect of the second-order eikonalcorrections is rather modest, even at $Q^{2} \\approx 0.2$ (GeV/c)$^2$.

        "In this paper, the notion of {\\em $p$-adic multiresolution analysis (MRA)} isintroduced. We use a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (arefinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. Thisequation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc isthe sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the realHaar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable functiongenerating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for realrefinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\\cL}^2(\\bQ_2)$ generated by the same HaarMRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differentialoperators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can beintensively used for applications.",

        "Human beings like to believe they are in control of their destiny. Thisubiquitous trait seems to increase motivation and persistence, and is probablyevolutionarily adaptive. But how good really is our ability to control? Howsuccessful is our track record in these areas? There is little understanding ofwhen and under what circumstances we may over-estimate or even lose our abilityto control and optimize outcomes, especially when they are the result ofaggregations of individual optimization processes. Here, we demonstrateanalytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations intwo classes of games, the Minority game and the Parrondo Games, that agents whooptimize their strategy based on past information actually perform worse thannon-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative)strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies.

        "We present a detailed analysis of the prompt and afterglow emission of GRB050410 and GRB 050412 detected by Swift for which no optical counterpart wasobserved. The 15-150 keV energy distribution of the GRB 050410 prompt emissionshows a peak energy at 53 keV. The XRT light curve of this GRB decays as apower law with a slope of alpha=1.06+/-0.04. The spectrum is well reproduced byan absorbed power law with a spectral index Gamma_x=2.4+/-0.4 and a low energyabsorption N_H=4(+3;-2)x10^21 cm^(-2) which is higher than the Galactic value.The 15-150 keV prompt emission in GRB 050412 is modelled with a hard(Gamma=0.7+/-0.2) power law. The XRT light curve follows a broken power lawwith the first slope alpha_1=0.7+/-0.4, the break time T_break=254(-41;+79) sand the second slope alpha_2=2.8(-0.8;+0.5). The spectrum is fitted by a powerlaw with spectral index Gamma_x=1.3+/-0.2 which is absorbed at low energies bythe Galactic column. The GRB 050410 afterglow reveals the expectedcharacteristics of the third component of the canonical Swift light curve.Conversely, a complex phenomenology was detected in the GRB 050412 because ofthe presence of the very early break. The light curve in this case can beinterpreted as being the last peak of the prompt emission. The two burstspresent tight upper limits for the optical emission, however, neither of themcan be clearly classified as dark. For GRB 050410, the suppression of theoptical afterglow could be attributed to a low density interstellar mediumsurrounding the burst. For GRB 050412, the evaluation of the darkness is moredifficult due to the ambiguity in the extrapolation of the X-ray afterglowlight curve.",

The hotel is not well insulated from outside sounds. The room doors and the rooms themselves are not designed to contain noise so it does not effect others. I could easily hear even not loud conversations in adjacent rooms on both sides as well as guests speaking not too loudly in the halls, even after 1am. I got precious few hours sleep that night!.

        "We present a new, detailed analysis of late-time mid-infrared (IR)observations of the Type II-P supernova (SN) 2003gd. At about 16 months afterthe explosion, the mid-IR flux is consistent with emission from 4 x 10^(-5)M(solar) of newly condensed dust in the ejecta. At 22 months emission frompoint-like sources close to the SN position was detected at 8 microns and 24microns. By 42 months the 24 micron flux had faded. Considerations ofluminosity and source size rule out the ejecta of SN 2003gd as the main originof the emission at 22 months. A possible alternative explanation for theemission at this later epoch is an IR echo from pre-existing circumstellar orinterstellar dust. We conclude that, contrary to the claim of Sugerman et al.(2006, Science, 313, 196), the mid-IR emission from SN 2003gd does not supportthe presence of 0.02 M(solar) of newly formed dust in the ejecta. There is, asyet, no direct evidence that core-collapse supernovae are major dust factories.",
        "We present new multi-wavelength millimeter interferometric observations ofthe Herbig Ae star HD 163296 obtained with the IRAM/PBI, SMA and VLA arraysboth in continuum and in the 12CO, 13CO and C18O emission lines. Gas and dustproperties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistentdisk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolvedboth in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellarmaterial is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The diskinclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a positionangle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7mm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust andCO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,we obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 isstrongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion ofdust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration oflarge bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in thedust distribution by a low mass companion.",

As a model system for a moredetailed study, we consider the quantum two-dimensional one-component plasma: asystem of charged particles of one species, interacting through the logarithmicCoulomb potential in two dimensions, in a uniformly charged background ofopposite sign, such that the total charge vanishes. The corresponding classicalsystem is exactly solvable in a variety of geometries, including the presentone of a half-plane, when $\\beta e^2=2$, where $\\beta$ is the inversetemperature and $e$ is the charge of a particle: all the classical $n$-bodydensities are known. For the quantum one-component plasma, two sum rulesinvolving the truncated two-body density (and, for one of them, the densityprofile) have been derived, a long time ago, by heuristic macroscopicarguments: one sum rule is about the asymptotic form along the wall of thetruncated two-body density, the other one is about the dipole moment of thestructure factor. In the two-dimensional case at $\\beta e^2=2$, we have nowexplicit expressions up to order $\\hbar^2$ of these two quantum densities, thuswe can microscopically check the sum rules at this order. The checks arepositive, reinforcing the idea that the sum rules are correct.",
        "Dear diary, Today I saved a plane from a hijacking! And it was all due to my most awesome talent! I was aboard a plane when some bumbling IRA lads decided to take over the cockpit. I had to make some quick thinking in order to peacefully negotiate our captors into relinquishing their hold on our aircraft. I quickly called out for a piece of paper and a sharpie. Thankfully the teen girl sitting across the aisle from me had both! Even though the sharpie she gave me was a hot pink, mini sharpie, it was enough. I quickly sketched out a picture of what I needed and BAM! It came to reality! I stood up and held in my arms what I had drawn. A full case of Jameson! I passed a bottle to each member of the IRA and, after finishing a few bottles over the course of some hours, they gave up the controls of the airplane to me. They then grabbed their parachutes and jumped out of the plane! Now when they jumped out, they left the plane with no fuel somewhere over the ocean, and I have no experience in flying a plane, and I may be writing this on a piece of scrap metal in a raft as the other passengers look at me with angry eyes, but I saved the plane from being hijacked! I think I did good. Everyone is now staring at me while they are holding plastic forks. I think that means it' s time for dinner. Got ta go! Until tomorrow, diary.",

        "We show numerically that in a binary system of Yukawa particles, a dispersitydriven disordering transition occurs. In the presence of quenched disorder thisdisordering transition coincides with a marked increase in the depinningthreshold, known as a peak effect. We find that the addition of poorly pinnedparticles can increase the overall pinning in the sample by increasing theamount of topological disorder present. If the quenched disorder is strongenough to create a significant amount of topological disorder in themonodisperse system, addition of a poorly pinned species generates furtherdisorder but does not produce a peak in the depinning force. Our resultsindicate that for binary mixtures, optimal pinning occurs for topologicaldefect fraction densities of 0.2 to 0.25. For defect densities below thisrange, the system retains orientational order. We determine the effect of thepinning density, strength, and radius on the depinning peak and find that thepeak effect is more pronounced in weakly pinning systems.",

        "We investigate the coupled formation and evolution of galaxies and theirembedded supermassive black holes using state-of-the-art hydrodynamicsimulations of cosmological structure formation. For the first time, weself-consistently follow the dark matter dynamics, radiative gas cooling, starformation, as well as black hole growth and associated feedback processes,starting directly from initial conditions appropriate for the LambdaCDMcosmology. Our modeling of the black hole physics is based on an approach wehave developed in simulations of isolated galaxy mergers. Here we examine: (i)the predicted global history of black hole mass assembly (ii) the evolution ofthe local black hole-host mass correlations and (iii) the conditions that allowrapid growth of the first quasars, and the properties of their hosts anddescendants today. We find a total black hole mass density in good agreementwith observational estimates. The black hole accretion rate density peaks atlower redshift and evolves more strongly at high redshift than the starformation rate density, but the ratio of black hole to stellar mass densitiesshows only a moderate evolution at low redshifts. We find strong correlationsbetween black hole masses and properties of the stellar systems, agreeing wellwith the measured local M_BH-sigma and M_BH -M_* relationships, but alsosuggesting (dependent on the mass range) a weak evolution with redshift in thenormalization and the slope. Our simulations also produce massive black holesat high redshift, due to extended periods of exponential growth in regions thatcollapse early and exhibit strong gas inflows. These first supermassive BHsystems however are not necessarily the most massive ones today, since they areoften overtaken in growth by quasars that form later. (abridged)",

        "The evolution of multicellular organisms from monocellular ancestorsrepresents one of the greatest advances of the history of life. The assembly ofsuch multicellular organisms requires signalling and response between cells:over millions of years these signalling processes have become extremelysophisticated and refined by evolution, such that study of modern organisms maynot be able to shed much light on the original ancient processes . Here we areinterested in determining how simple a signalling method can be, while stillachieving self-assembly. In 2D a coupled cellular automaton/differentialequation approach models organisms and chemotaxic chemicals, producingspiralling aggregation. In 3D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used torepresent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling isfollowed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able toemit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony ofsingle-cell organisms can assemble into shapes as complex as a tower, a ballatop a stalk, or a fast-moving slug. The similarity with the behaviour ofmodern Dictyostelium slime molds signalling with cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP) is striking.",

        "We study the evolution of a neutral $K$ meson prepared as an incoherent equalmixture of $K^0$ and $\\bar{K^0}$. Denoting the density matrix by $\\rho(t) ={1/2} N(t) [\\1 + \\vec{\\zeta}(t) \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} ] $, the norm of the state$N(t)$ is found to decrease monotonically from one to zero, while the magnitudeof the Stokes vector $|\\vec{\\zeta}(t)|$ increases monotonically from zero toone. This property qualifies these observables as arrows of time. Requiringmonotonic behaviour of $N(t)$ for arbitrary values of $\\gamma_L, \\gamma_S$ and$\\Delta m$ yields a bound on the CP-violating overlap $\\delta =\\braket{K_L}{K_S}$, which is similar to, but weaker than, the known unitaritybound.

How do I finish the day a better person? \" About three weeks into this groundhog day-esque adventure, he realised that if this would continue to go on, why not have a little fun? Many days would end in prison, hospital, or even in death - But it does n' t matter, I am immortal. I do n' t age, I do n' t die, there are no consequences to my actions, I am a god. I decided to continue last night - then came today. The day started surprisingly well, I awoke next to my wife after about three months of having some incredible intimacy the night before, but I slipped up. I forgot about something I did yesterday - Well, the actual yesterday, the one that happened the day I chose to continue. There was a knock on the door, I knew who it was.. what was coming, ca n' t I just go back a day? Even if I finish today alive and free, my options are to keep running, do this whole thing again or... I could restart my life. Restart my life... I' ve come to accept that the only way i' m going to die is via old age or sickness, as every time I die unnaturally, I just restart the day and make sure it does n' t happen again, but restart my whole entire life?! Shit, I ca n' t live through this again, what if I lose my memory, what if I have to wait until i' m 15 again before I unlock this ability? No - I ca n' t restart. I' ve got to run. I kissed my sleeping wife on the forehead. \" Goodbye, see you on the other side \" I had lived yesterday so many times, but nothing could prepare me for today, there was a reason I was putting it off for so long. I slowly walked downstairs and opened the door.. Nobody. Wait what?! I looked down and saw an envelope. I opened it right then and there, this is not what I was expecting at all.. There was a large peice of blank paper, with two words written in the centre. \" Restart Life \" To be continued",
        "We consider a chirally invariant lattice Higgs-Yukawa model based on theNeuberger overlap operator. As a first step towards the eventual determinationof Higgs mass bounds we study the phase diagram of the model analytically inthe large Nf-limit. We present an expression for the effective potential attree-level in the regime of small Yukawa and quartic coupling constants anddetermine the order of the phase transitions. In the case of strong Yukawacouplings the model effectively becomes an O(4)-symmetric non-linearsigma-model for all values of the quartic coupling constant. This leads to theexistence of a symmetric phase also in the regime of large values of the Yukawacoupling constant. On finite and small lattices, however, strong finite volumeeffects prevent the expectation value of the Higgs field from vanishing thusobscuring the existence of the symmetric phase at strong Yukawa couplings.",
        "Magnetic nanoparticles with Neel surface anisotropy, different internalstructures, surface arrangements and elongation are modelled as many-spinsystems. The results suggest that the energy of many-spin nanoparticles cutfrom cubic lattices can be represented by an effective one-spin potentialcontaining uniaxial and cubic anisotropies. It is shown that the values andsigns of the corresponding constants depend strongly on the particle's surfacearrangement, internal structure and elongation. Particles cut from a simplecubic lattice have the opposite sign of the effective cubic term, as comparedto particles cut from the face-centered cubic lattice. Furthermore, otherremarkable phenomena are observed in nanoparticles with relatively strongsurface effects: (i) In elongated particles surface effects can change the signof the uniaxial anisotropy. (ii) In symmetric particles (spherical andtruncated octahedral) with cubic core anisotropy surface effects can change itssign. We also show that the competition between the core and surfaceanisotropies leads to a new energy that contributes to both the 2nd- and4th-order effective anisotropies.",
        "We present the results of a new spectroscopic and photometric survey of thehot, binary X-ray cluster A115 at z=0.193, containing a radio relic. We combinegalaxy velocity and position information to select 85 galaxies recognized ascluster members (from 115 galaxies observed at TNG telescope), determine globaldynamical properties and detect substructures. We find that A115 presentsvelocity dispersion of sigma_v=1362_{-108}^{+126} km/s. Our analysis confirmsthe presence of two structures (A115N and A115S) of cluster--type wellrecognizable in the plane of the sky and shows that they differ of ~2000 km/sin the LOS velocity. We estimate that A115S is slightly dynamically moreimportant than A115N having sigma_v=900-1100 km/s vs sigma_v=750-850 km/s.Moreover, we find evidence for two small groups at low velocities. We estimatea global cluster virial mass of 2.2--3.5 e15 h_70 Msun. Our results agree witha pre--merging scenario where A115N and A115S are colliding with a LOS impactvelocity Delta v~1600 km/s.The most likely solution to the two--body problemsuggests that the merging axis lies at $\\sim 20$ degrees from the plane of thesky and that the cores will cross after ~0.1 Gyr. The radio relic with itslargest dimension perpendicular to the merging axis is likely connected to thismerger.",
        "Not cold, as advertised, but an otherworldly touch. Starting in his toes and the very tips of his fingers there was the distinct feeling of nothing. Wholly unlike numbness, it was an acute sensation. He could actively feel the void that was occupying the fringes of his body. It crept inward. Like the heat of the day erasing a morning snow, the void melted the living tissue into a trickle of nothingness adding to the vacuum. The feeling had consumed most of his arms and legs and had begun to encompass his head. As it delved deeper, he got progressively duller. This new sensation, much like being sleepy, caused his thoughts to come much slower than normal and made him less attuned to his situation. At this point, much of his torso had been swallowed up. The void was encircling his heart. He no longer had any knowledge of his environment; he was just a body floating in blackness. He could feel his heart beating hard like a hammer in his chest as if trying to push back. The beating started to slow rapidly and then stop. As if this was its cue, a wave of darkness washed over his entire body, and he was no more.",

I' m off into this icy plane to see what this hell sired. When I arrive my teammates are all brooding with excitement, but fear is in their eyes as well as I see what the call meant. A block of ice not clear as glass but clear enough to see the brown and husky figure there as frozen as can be. We haul the block back, ice and all, to find what is inside. To find a creature old and lost would boost all of our pride! So as we start to melt the block, the ice drips and decays, and soon an arm burst through the side to all of our dismay.

The glow of his planet suspended in the air was dancing over his young lips. they spread open in a slight gasp when he saw the evacuation. hundreds over a few hours leaving that mountain, yet hundreds left behind. It was almost too easy. Starve them, yet show them how others can live so grandiose. It was his motto, really. The science had been proven for as long as anyone knew, or remembered. Show them the inequality, let them feel it every day; suspend the belief that they can change their station. That sandy sector had proved to be no challenge, indeed it had been that way well before he was born. Others on the blue ball were returning to their natural state. He knew it could not be permitted. Endless images were thrust into the wealthier parts of the sphere of blood, weapons, sex, ego' s that oozed with a neurotic sense of self-worth. Their had to be constant reminders of the beings inadequacies, endless visuals to keep them uncertain, questioning and buying the self-doubt. Still, some were not behaving. Jones pushed a button on his collar and the room whizzed. The blue orb expanded and zoomed to a green patch on the northern hemisphere. His eyes danced, subdued in the glow. Riots, fuel stations on fire, shootings, disrespect of authority; yes, he could culture this. It was more good work in the region than he had seen in a while. Of course there were the constant, petty small squabbles, one or two dead here, but never so much of a response. This breeds hate, Jones thought. His superiors would be pleased.",

The menu seemed fairly traditional, I don't recall seeing the more \"Americanized\" (what I consider) \"crazy\" rolls that many trendy sushi restaurants (like NYC's & PHL's Haru) offer. And don't take that as a bad thing. While I'll happily admit to liking those \"crazy Americanized\" rolls, its nice to find a great more traditional place out there. From what I understand Mr Shu is very stringent in regards to his sushi standards, to the point that he does not allow his sous chefs to prepare sushi if he is not around to supervise. nnThe restaurant itself is small & cozy (& up a loooooooong flights of stairs) & without the loud banging tunes you find in the more trendy restaurants so that a great conversation is possible to have whether you're there on a date or catching up with a friend. nnI wanted to try the omakase, but opted against it as Umi was my second dinner of the evening (I'm a pig, I know), however I have heard pretty mixed reviews on whether or not its worth it. nnThe service was simply OK.  Kind of slow. No, more like definitely slow. Nothing special. Still gave the waitress a 20%+ tip though so obviously I still wouldn't call the service horrendous.",
        "The problem of limit shapes in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundaryconditions is addressed by considering a specially tailored bulk correlationfunction, the emptiness formation probability. A closed expression of thiscorrelation function is given, both in terms of certain determinant andmultiple integral, which allows for a systematic treatment of the limit shapesof the model for full range of values of vertex weights. Specifically, we showthat for vertex weights corresponding to the free-fermion line on the phasediagram, the emptiness formation probability is related to a one-matrix modelwith a triple logarithmic singularity, or Triple Penner model. The saddle-pointanalysis of this model leads to the Arctic Circle Theorem, and itsgeneralization to the Arctic Ellipses, known previously from domino tilings.",
        "We obtained H-band polarimetric data of IRAS 19312+1950 using thenear-infrared camera (CIAO) on the 8 m Subaru telescope. In order toinvestigate the physical properties of the central star and the nebula, weperformed dust radiative transfer modeling and compared the model results withthe observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs), the radial profiles of thetotal intensity image, and the fraction of linear polarization map. The totalintensity image shows a nearly spherical core with ~3\" radius, an S-shaped armextending ~10\" in the northwest to southeast direction, and an extended lobetowards the southwest. The polarization map shows a centro-symmetric vectoralignment in almost the entire nebula and low polarizations along the S-shapedarm. These results suggest that the nebula is accompanied by a central star,and the S-shaped arm has a physically ring-like structure. From our radiativetransfer modeling, we estimated the stellar temperature, the bolometricluminosity, and the current mass-loss rate to be 2800 K, 7000 L_sun, and5.3x10^{-6} M_sun yr^{-1}, respectively. Taking into account previousobservational results, such as the detection of SiO maser emissions andsilicate absorption feature in the 10 $\\mu$m spectrum, our dust radiativetransfer analysis based on our NIR imaging polarimetry suggests that (1) thecentral star of IRAS 19312+1950 is likely to be an oxygen-rich, dust-enshroudedAGB star and (2) most of the circumstellar material originates from othersources (e.g. ambient dark clouds) rather than as a result of mass loss fromthe central star.",

        "We present a new, completely Lagrangian magnetohydrodynamics code that isbased on the SPH method. The equations of self-gravitating hydrodynamics arederived self-consistently from a Lagrangian and account for variable smoothinglength (``grad-h''-) terms in both the hydrodynamic and the gravitationalacceleration equations. The evolution of the magnetic field is formulated interms of so-called Euler potentials which are advected with the fluid and thusguarantee the MHD flux-freezing condition. This formulation is equivalent to avector potential approach and therefore fulfills the$\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{B}=0$-constraint by construction. Extensive tests inone, two and three dimensions are presented. The tests demonstrate theexcellent conservation properties of the code and show the clear superiority ofthe Euler potentials over earlier magnetic SPH formulations.",

But Steve was n' t ready to have fun yet; he needed to head to the supermarket to get some groceries. He walked across his garden and unlocked his car, before getting in and driving off. As Steve drove down the road, he drove carefully; the road shook and wobbled as children and other people nearby jumped around, making concentration essential. Eventually, he arrived at the supermarket. He got out of his car, and entered the building, which was swaying around from the movement of people inside. Inside, Steve wandered through the aisles, the weight of his and other peoples' causing the shelves to slightly bend towards them. Fortunately, the shelves had bars across them so that items would n' t fall off when they would bend downwards. He bought the groceries he needed and drove back home. Soon afterwards, his son, Sam, arrived home from school for the day. He took Steve out to the garden with him, and they began to jump around. The fun was beginning.",

Recently new experimental dataon light mesons caused much excitement and renewed interest to the phenomenon,which still remains to be enigmatic. The present retrospective review is anattempt to trace the history of parity doubling phenomenon, thus providing akind of introduction to the subject. We begin with early approaches of 1960s(Regge theory and dynamical symmetries) and end up with the latest trends(manifestations of broader degeneracies and AdS/QCD). We show the evolution ofvarious ideas about parity doubling. The experimental evidence for thisphenomenon is scrutinized in the non-strange sector. Some experiments of 1960sdevoted to the search for missing non-strange bosons are re-examined and it isargued that results of these experiments are encouraging from the modernperspective.",

        "It was a great time, it has a great atmosphere but the food was sub par. I think we ordered every appetizer on the menu. nnCalamari - It was ok, I am not much of a fan it did seem a bit on the rubbery side. nnBruschetta - Was very soggy with the tomatoes, not sure if that was the point but soggy bread is not very appetizing. nnTomatoes with mozzarella - The tomatoes were great but the mozzarella slices were SO thick it was ridiculous, nearly double the size of the tomatoes. nnGoat Cheese - This was without a doubt my favorite of anything all night. Very rich and smooth. nnI ended up ordering the special of the evening: Chicken and spinach ravioli with white truffle oil. It was good but nothing to rave about. nnI have had way better Italian in Charlotte so its hard for me to recommend Ricotta's. nnnOh and I dont know if it was me but the floor seemed super slippery!",

My new favorite, since I'm not always a red meat fan. Their Monday night salad is excellent, and should be tried.. . Its a chopped salad that is very tasty and different from the typical leafy type salad or wedge salad. nI took off 1 star, and because we have a history of going there, for some reason the familiar staff needs to feel like they have to entertain or visit us.

        "Personality was important in this world. It ended up affecting your status in society, your job, your partners. Dogs would often end up as police officers, parrots as talk show hosts, seagulls as fishermen or naval crew. The alpacas of the world often ended up as psychopaths, which was a rather strange trait. Most people mated with others with the same spirit animal. Their children were often bonded with similar spirit animals. It was very rare for anyone to have certain animals. Lions were often leaders, politicians or royalty. Eagles were suited as military personnel. It was n' t unheard of for a poor family to have a child with an animal that would catapult them into the upper echelons of society. Eric had always been a quiet child. He was never loud and boisterous like the other children, the ones who now had bears. Nor was he bright and chirpy, like those who now had finches. He was n' t slow and steady like the children who had whales or elephants. To everyone else, Eric just faded into the background, while the other children played and danced with their new animals. Eric was now surrounded by a group of his classmates. They were all jeering at him, their animals growling, circling and occasionally pretending to rush him. He was the youngest child in the class, his birthday on the 21st of December. They had found him walking, alone, in the bitter cold, with no spirit animal by him. Easy pickings for the bullies. As they closed in, Eric closed his eyes. He was used to this by now. He was of slight build, and not very tall. He waited for the first blow to land. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shrieks sounded. He cracked open one eye. All of the children were running away, looking fearfully at a point behind him. He turned slowly. A large black jaguar was staring right at him. It purred softly, a little rumble that sounded strangely comforting. Eric looked around, and back at the animal- no, his spirit animal. He smiled. No more pain. For him, at least.",
        "Cash-only makes this even more difficult. Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber, along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $. 50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only. nnF. Y. I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch! I did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing. It was quite good that way and I might recommend that QS rethink the Gyro presentation if they want to continue using so much lettuce.",
        "Then I had the thought hey might as well check out the store while I'm here! nnI actually appreciate people who buy in bulk, it uses a lot less resources to package everything when you do that and indirectly help the environment yay! What happened was I saw a bunch of individually packaged things packaged into one big thing. Well that's sure different, way to waste money on that. The store itself is fairly clean and generic. I did find some cool organic detergent to try out and bought a few baguettes as well as a cheap bottle of wine that I ended up liking quite a bit. Then when I finished checking out I had to get my receipt checked when walking out, geez do they treat everyone like a potential thief here? nnI don't like Walmart due to long queues, shoddy service, shoddy products, and shoddy employment practices.

        "The rage of dying left me empty and alone. Hollow. I remembered being a carpenter. I knew how to build all kinds of things, and so I had tools, materials, dimensions, all of this information sloshing in my head as if clothes in a broken washing machine. It seemed natural that in death, I would continue my work. Even though I was something else, I still had that life in my head — burning in my mind. It took me an eternity to begin my work. I was alone. Wherever this was existed as nothing — a featureless plain of grey mist and dim sourceless light, yet I sculpted the mist to form vast walls and caverns. I carved form into an endless waste, and left meaning in my wake. Others would follow. It was necessary. A door, once opened, can be opened again. They would make their way to this oblivion and see my work, and know me as creator of this new world. Through the mist they would find this damning place, and they would find me, keeper of this dominion of the dead. I kept no laws or rules or strictures; my people were free to do as they pleased. Unrestricted from the demanding necessities of life they had ( potentially ) the rest of time to exist unbound by any code of conduct, absolutely ungoverned. From my pit, I watched them. I had no eyes to see with — they had long since abandoned me — but still I watched them. Some organized themselves into echoes of their living societies. Others revelled in this newfound freedom. Others still went mad with the truth of it all. After death, there is no Heaven nor Hell to let you in. There is only freedom. There is only me.",

        "The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various MgB2 films have beenstudied at different magnetic fields parallel to c-axis. At fields \\mu0Hbetween 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-Visotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures showa scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortexglass theory. However, at \\mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed downto the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale interms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this maybe caused by a mixture of \\sigma band vortices and \\pi band quasiparticles.Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaledaccording to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalenteffect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.",
        "Funai Electric has been producing VHS-playing VCRs for 33 years, most recently in China for Sanyo.But last year it sold just 750,000 units, down from a peak of 15 million a year, and has been finding it difficult to source the necessary parts.VCRs were introduced in the 1970s but were superseded by DVD technology.Last year, Sony announced it would stop selling Betamax video cassettes -  a rival to the VHS. VCRs were required to play or record such tapes.It was 12 years ago that UK High Street retailer Dixons decided to phase out the sale of VCRs due to the popularity of DVD players.Some vintage technologies - such as vinyl - have enjoyed a renaissance.However, Tania Loeffler, an analyst at IHS Technology, does not think the same nostalgia will ever be felt for VCR-playable formats.\"I don't see VCR becoming like vinyl, where a lot of people appreciated the warmness of how something sounds on vinyl,\" she told the BBC.\"The quality on VHS is not something I think anyone would want to go back to.\"However, she added that a niche market for accessing VHS content, perhaps for archival purposes, would probably mourn the loss of VCRs if they became unavailable.",

Properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at an intermediateredshift interval (0.9 < z < 1.9) are studied. The amount of baryons in thediffuse photoionised IGM and the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) aretraced to get constraints on the redshift evolution of the different phases ofthe intergalactic gas. The baryon density of the diffuse IGM is determined withphotoionisation calculations under the assumption of local hydrostaticequilibrium. We assume that the gas is ionised by a metagalactic backgroundradiation with a Haardt & Madau (2001) spectrum. The WHIM is traced with broadLyman alpha (BLA) absorption. The properties of a number of BLA detections arestudied. Under the assumption of collisional ionisation equilibrium a lowerlimit to the baryon density could be estimated. It is found that the diffusephotoionised IGM contains at least 25% of the total baryonic matter atredshifts 1 < z < 2. For the WHIM a lower limit of 2.4% could be determined.Furthermore the data indicates that the intergalactic gas is in a state ofevolution at z=1.5. We confirm that a considerable part of the WHIM is createdbetween z=1 and z=2.",

        "nnBUT. .. nnThe prices are 10-25% higher (sometimes more) than Woodman's in Sun Prairie, the produce leaves much to be desired in terms of quality and the check-out lines are ridiculously long if you visit between 4-6 p. m. It's understandably a busy time of day for people to pop into the grocery store, but it seems as though this Pick 'n Save refuses to adjust its staffing needs appropriately. Like another reviewer pointed out, very basic produce (basically, anything green) is often wilty, slimey and/or brown. I pointed this out to a produce worker once and asked if they had anything more fresh and he went to the back for better lettuce. .. which was only slightly better than what was out. nnThe prices, however, are my biggest beef. For example, an avocado at Woodman's is $. 69-. 79 each, whereas at Pick 'n Save, they are $1. 69-1. 79 each. Now and then they run a sale: 2 for $3. Whoa! The savings! HA. A 96 oz. bottle of Welch's grape juice costs $6. 19 at Pick 'n Save; at Woodman's the same bottle costs about $3. 59. A container of heavy whipping cream is double the cost of the same size whipping cream at Woodman's. A Palermo's Thin Crust pizza is $6-7 at Pick 'n Save; 2 for $10 at Woodman's (although they have been running an occasional sale at PNS with BOGO on the Palermo's, making them an excellent deal). Small carving pumpkins: $3. 99 at Pick 'n Save, HUGE-ASS carving pumpkins at Woodman's were $3. 49. And on and on. If you're on a grocery budget, Pick 'n Save makes saving money and getting good buys a major battle of the wits with its customers. You've got the Fresh Perks card, some sort of e-coupon option, etc.. .. hey, how about you just lower your frickin' prices?? nnDespite being 5 minutes from my house, I plan my grocery shopping so that I only have to shop there in a pinch. Otherwise, I load up at Woodman's.",

We really just had one who had to be cut by someone else. nnHe was so big, and his hair would get so matted that it was virtually impossible for us to do it. So we needed help. That's when we called on A Dog's Best Friend. We did take another of our dogs there a couple of times, but she was smaller, and so we'd typically do her hair ourselves. nnThe others either didn't need cutting - ever - or are so small that it's just not worth it. But for the larger dogs that take too long or are too difficult for us to control? It's absolutely worth having someone else do. That's when you need a professional, and they take care of them. nnOn the down side of things, they are a bit pricey. For a bath and a cut (or a cut and a bath, I have no idea which order they do it), it would be $70, and that was some time ago. It's nice to not have to do it, but we couldn't afford to do it very often. Great job, he looked great, but man that was expensive!",

        "The smell of pizza emanating from the box in my hands has grown old. For the past year I have been delivering for Smitty' s Pizza Hut to get the extra cash I need for my tuition bill. I' ve already submitted my two week notice and this is my last day, in fact my last delivery before moving back home to California. The sound of the door bell has a very odd sound. It chimed three times with one press of the bell. I began to reach for the doorbell again before I heard the foot steps. It sounds like a heavy set person. Maybe this customer does n' t need this delivery. The door opened slowly with a very audible creak before revealing a man wearing a black hoodie, jeans, and a very cartoonish Ronald Reagan mask. \" Nice mask bro. Here' s your pizza. That' ll be $ 18. 72. \" The man just stood there staring at me. He had a very foul smell about him and I could very easily hear heavy breathing. Thank goodness he' s wearing that mask. I bet this guys breath smells about as bad as the stench emitting from what is more than likely an unbathed body. \" It' s $ 18. 72. You want this pizza or not? \" I shifted my weight and my gaze was caught at the scene that was beyond him. A woman and two children were tied to chairs with make shift gags of cloth in their mouths. The cloth in the woman' s mouth was drenched and had spittle being flung around as she violently shook her head trying to do what I can very easily assume was scream for help. That was when I noticed the gun. It was firmly gripped in the hand of the man standing before me pointed downwards. It was then that the man finally spoke his first words. \" You' re just in time for the party. \" As he rose the gun to my face I felt my entire body begin to freeze. The boxes fell from my hands and landed hard on the ground. \" Pick that up and come inside. Everyone is going to need to be fed if were going to have a fun night. \"",

This was a beast who' s master had been slaughtered. There were four us who dared to stop the beast. Koren went in to the den first. A man too proud to ever accept help or assistance. A battle cry and a loud, bone shattering crunch were the only sounds heard. His limp body was thrown from the den. We constructed a grave for him. We placed his sword in his grave with him. If there is an afterlife, he will need it. The twins Ryker and Rayk now entered the den. I heard the sound of projectiles flying through the air, accompanied with the sound of them hitting their mark. A roar emerged from the den with enough force to shoot Ryker out of the den like a bat out of hell. He hit tree, his back was broken when I reached him. \" Help. \" Was all he could get out. I nodded my head as I thrust my dagger into his chest. The cave had grown silent. I approached to Rayk lying face down in a pool of blood. On his arm was a message. For the Village was all it said. I now turned to face the dragon with my dagger still unsheathed. In the ancient tongue I yelled, \" I am Yagua. Fear me and all that I am and will become. \" The dragon breathed a fire as if he were a volcano. We fought not for our own sake, but for our races. We fought tooth for tooth, and nail for claw. After what seemed like an hour of fighting, the dragon stumbled. I pierced his heart with my dagger. I am the victor. I dug graves for Ryker and Rayk next to Koren.

        "We report on the transport and magnetic properties of hybrid trilayers andbilayers that consist of low spin-polarized Ni80Fe20 exhibiting in-plane but nouniaxial anisotropy and low-Tc Nb. We reveal a magnetoresistance effect that ispronounced. In our trilayers the magnetoresistance exhibits an increase of twoorders of magnitude when the superconducting state is reached: from theconventional normal-state values 0.6 % it goes up to 1000 % for temperaturesbelow Tc. In contrast, in the bilayers the effect is only minor since from 3%in the normal state increases only to 70 % for temperatures below Tc.Magnetization data of both the longitudinal and transverse magnetic componentsare presented. Most importantly, we present data not only for the normal stateof Nb but also in its superconducting state. Strikingly, these data show thatbelow its Tc SC the Nb interlayer under the influence of the outer Ni80Fe20layers attains a magnetization component transverse to the external field. Bycomparing the transport and magnetization data we propose a candidate mechanismthat could motivate the pronounced magnetoresistance effect observed in thetrilayers. Adequate magnetostatic coupling of the outer Ni80Fe20 layers ismotivated by stray fields that emerge naturally in their whole surface due tothe multidomain magnetic structure that they attain near coercivity. Atomicforce microscopy is employed in order to examine the possibility that suchmagnetostatic coupling could be promoted by interface roughness. Referring tothe bilayers, although out-of-plane rotation of the magnetization of the singleNi80Fe20 layer is still observed, in these structures magnetostatic couplingdoes not occur due to the absence of a second Ni80Fe20 one so that the observedmagnetoresistance peaks are only modest.",

Mainly egg sandwiches served on any number of breads and with any number of regular meats, you can't beat the prices here once you are within the \"uptown grid. \" Under $3 is a little insane, and so post-workout, I like my odds at Arthurs. nnIn the morning there is never a wait and the staff looks a little surprised someone stopped in before 8: 30 a. m.

        "In the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance twogoals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar tothe Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present anew planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towardsboth of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that isable to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planettransits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the timebetween transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to inferthe orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a massthat is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection techniquecomplements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motionresonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reducedsensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded thephotometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTVplanet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number ofhigh-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existingtelescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transitingplanets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\\sim 0.5{\\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramaticallyincrease the effectiveness of transit timing observations.",

        "Shock and release temperatures in Mo were calculated, taking account ofheating from plastic flow predicted using the Steinberg-Guinan model. Plasticflow was calculated self-consistently with the shock jump conditions: this isnecessary for a rigorous estimate of the locus of shock states accessible. Thetemperatures obtained were significantly higher than predicted assuming idealhydrodynamic loading. The temperatures were compared with surface emissionspectrometry measurements for Mo shocked to around 60GPa and then released intovacuum or into a LiF window. Shock loading was induced by the impact of aplanar projectile, accelerated by high explosive or in a gas gun. Surfacevelocimetry showed an elastic wave at the start of release from the shockedstate; the amplitude of the elastic wave matched the prediction to around 10%,indicating that the predicted flow stress in the shocked state was reasonable.The measured temperatures were consistent with the simulations, indicating thatthe fraction of plastic work converted to heat was in the range 70-100% forthese loading conditions.",

        "Astronomy can never be a hard core physics discipline, because the Universeoffers no control experiment, i.e. with no independent checks it is bound to behighly ambiguous and degenerate. Thus e.g. while superluminal motion can beexplained by Special Relativity. data on the former can never on their own beused to establish the latter. This is why traditionally astrophysicists havebeen content with (and proud of) their ability to use known physical laws andprocesses established in the laboratory to explain celestial phenomena.Cosmology is not even astrophysics: all the principal assumptions in this fieldare unverified (or unverifiable) in the laboratory, and researchers are quitecomfortable with inventing unknowns to explain the unknown. How then could,after fifty years of failed attempt in finding dark matter, the fields of darkmatter {\\it and now} dark energy have become such lofty priorities in astronomyfunding, to the detriment of all other branches of astronomy? I demonstrate inthis article that while some of is based upon truth, at least just as much of$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology has been propped by a paralyzing amount of propagandawhich suppress counter evidence and subdue competing models. The recent WMAP3paper of Spergel et al (2007) will be used as case in point on selectivecitation. I also show that when all evidence are taken into account, two of thecompeting models that abolish dark energy and/or dark matter do not trailbehind $\\Lambda$CDM by much. Given all of the above, I believe astronomy is nolonger heading towards a healthy future, unless funding agencies re-think theirmaster plans by backing away from such high a emphasis on groping in the dark.",

        "Rolled in at 10am to meet a handful of people. Because it is Labor Day weekend, the place was empty except for a woman who had just gotten there too which was nice because a friend had warned me that the place gets crazy. We sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. I think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. It looks like they have since raised the prices since Miles O. went. I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. I ended up boxing half of my omlette entree. Portions were large, atmosphere was cool, food was good and wait staff were awesome but in the end I don't think $24 (not including the tip and tax) was worth it.",
        "Gravitational waves from the inspiral and coalescence of supermassiveblack-hole (SMBH) binaries with masses ~10^6 Msun are likely to be among thestrongest sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Wedescribe a three-stage data-analysis pipeline designed to search for andmeasure the parameters of SMBH binaries in LISA data. The first stage uses atime-frequency track-search method to search for inspiral signals and provide acoarse estimate of the black-hole masses m_1, m_2 and of the coalescence timeof the binary t_c. The second stage uses a sequence of matched-filter templatebanks, seeded by the first stage, to improve the measurement accuracy of themasses and coalescence time. Finally, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo search is usedto estimate all nine physical parameters of the binary. Using results from thesecond stage substantially shortens the Markov Chain burn-in time and allows usto determine the number of SMBH-binary signals in the data before startingparameter estimation. We demonstrate our analysis pipeline using simulated datafrom the first LISA Mock Data Challenge. We discuss our plan for improving thispipeline and the challenges that will be faced in real LISA data analysis.",

The bread sticks were pretty underwhelming--there was no garlic or flavor really. Booo. nnOnce everyone arrived, we placed orders. I got the Bruschetta Salmon. When I asked the waiter how it was, he said he hadn't tried it in forever but that people say it's decent--I appreciated that honesty! They served salad shortly     My goodness this place was slow though. The food took forever. When it came out, it was pretty lousy. I found two bones in the salmon before I quit eating it. The risotto pasta thing under it was so heavy and the salmon was sort of hard and the toppings made no sense. It felt like two or three dishes in one. Others' food didn't come out, so the manager came out and apologized and comped several meals. He even went up to the birthday boy and told him he'd comp his dessert as well. Thumbs up. nnDessert was actually pretty good--I got the chocolate tuxedo mousse cake which was quite good and it seems everyone else enjoyed theirs as well.

        "We present observations of pure rotational molecular hydrogen emission fromthe Herbig Ae star, AB Aurigae.

We searched for H2 emission in theS(1), S(2), and S(4) lines at high spectral resolution and detected all three.By fitting a simple model for the emission in the three transitions, we deriveT = 670 +/- 40 K and M = 0.52 +/- 0.15 earth masses for the emitting gas. Basedon the 8.5 km/s FWHM of the S(2) line, assuming the emission comes from thecircumstellar disk, and with an inclination estimate of the AB Aur system takenfrom the literature, we place the location for the emission near 18 AU.Comparison of our derived temperature to a disk structure model suggests thatUV and X-ray heating are important in heating the disk atmosphere.",

        "The isolated horizon framework was introduced in order to provide a localdescription of black holes that are in equilibrium with their (possiblydynamic) environment. Over the past several years, the framework has beenextended to include matter fields (dilaton, Yang-Mills etc) in D=4 dimensionsand cosmological constant in $D\\geq3$ dimensions. In this article we present afurther extension of the framework that includes black holes inhigher-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. In particular, weconstruct a covariant phase space for EGB gravity in arbitrary dimensions whichallows us to derive the first law. We find that the entropy of a weaklyisolated and non-rotating horizon is given by$\\mathcal{S}=(1/4G_{D})\\oint_{S^{D-2}}\\bm{\\tilde{\\epsilon}}(1+2\\alpha\\mathcal{R})$.In this expression $S^{D-2}$ is the $(D-2)$-dimensional cross section of thehorizon with area form $\\bm{\\tilde{\\epsilon}}$ and Ricci scalar $\\mathcal{R}$,$G_{D}$ is the $D$-dimensional Newton constant and $\\alpha$ is the Gauss-Bonnetparameter. This expression for the horizon entropy is in agreement with thosepredicted by the Euclidean and Noether charge methods. Thus we extend theisolated horizon framework beyond Einstein gravity.",

        "We investigate the accuracy of astrometric measurements with the VLT/FORS1camera and consider potential applications. The study is based on two-epoch(2000 and 2002/2003) frame series of observations of a selected Galactic Bulgesky region that were obtained with FORS1 during four consecutive nights each.Reductions were carried out with a novel technique that eliminates atmosphericimage motion and does not require a distinction between targets and referenceobjects. The positional astrometric precision was found to be limited only bythe accuracy of the determination of the star photocentre, which is typically200-300 microarcsec per single measurement for bright unsaturated starsB=18-19. Several statistical tests have shown that at time-scales of 1-4 nightsthe residual noise in measured positions is essentially a white noise with nosystematic instrumental signature and no significant deviation from a Gaussiandistribution. Some evidence of a good astrometric quality of the VLT for framesseparated by two years has also been found. Our data show that the VLT withFORS1/2 cameras can be effectively used for astrometric observations ofplanetary microlensing events and other applications where a high accuracy isrequired, that is expected to reach 30-40 microarcsec for a series of 50 frames(one hours with R filter).",

During the the interaction, there is a chance thatthe Sun will be pulled away from its present orbital radius and reside in anextended tidal tail. The likelihood for this outcome increases as the mergerprogresses, and there is a remote possibility that our Sun will be more tightlybound to Andromeda than to the Milky Way before the final merger. Eventually,after the merger has completed, the Sun is most likely to be scattered to theouter halo and reside at much larger radii (>30 kpc). The density profiles ofthe stars, gas and dark matter in the merger product resemble those ofelliptical galaxies. Our Local Group model therefore provides a prototypeprogenitor of late--forming elliptical galaxies.",
        "Phylogenetic mixtures model the inhomogeneous molecular evolution commonlyobserved in data. The performance of phylogenetic reconstruction methods wherethe underlying data is generated by a mixture model has stimulated considerablerecent debate. Much of the controversy stems from simulations of mixture modeldata on a given tree topology for which reconstruction algorithms output a treeof a different topology; these findings were held up to show the shortcomingsof particular tree reconstruction methods. In so doing, the underlyingassumption was that mixture model data on one topology can be distinguishedfrom data evolved on an unmixed tree of another topology given enough data andthe ``correct'' method. Here we show that this assumption can be false. Forbiologists our results imply that, for example, the combined data from twogenes whose phylogenetic trees differ only in terms of branch lengths canperfectly fit a tree of a different topology.",
        "In this paper, photonic entanglement and interference are described andanalyzed with the language of quantum information process. Correspondingly, aphoton state involving several degrees of freedom is represented in a newexpression based on the permutation symmetry of bosons. In this expression,each degree of freedom of a single photon is regarded as a qubit and operationson photons as qubit gates. The two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference is wellinterpreted with it. Moreover, the analysis reveals the entanglement betweendifferent degrees of freedom in a four-photon state from parametric downconversion, even if there is no entanglement between them in the two-photonstate. The entanglement will decrease the state purity and photon interferencevisibility in the experiments on a four-photon polarization state.",
        "I did n' t look at the supplicant as I prepared the tray of seedlings. Perhaps he would go away. Most do. After some time he found his courage and spoke up, \" Holy Mother, I offer myself in Atonement. \". \" Do you? \", I asked looking up at last. \" Do you really? \". \" Yes Mother \". He was a tall man. Gaunt with age. Garbed in the robe of a supplicant with head shorn he lacked identifying features. But his hands were calloused and spoke of manual labor. And his skin was tanned by hours in the sun. Grief was etched deeply into the lines of his face. \" Do you know what Atonement entails? \". \" I will Atone for the sins of humanity with my suffering. That you may bless us... my grandson, he has the cancer and \" \" It does n' t work that way. \" \" Mother? But he' s only 7 years old. His life has barely begun. A life for a life. Please Moth... \" \" And there are more important blessings to dispense. Many children are dying. Some could cure cancer, stop wars, heal nations. Others will not. I' m sorry. But they are more important. \" I reached again for my tools. This one would not Atone. My acolytes were already stepping forward to escort him away. \" And others will cause wars! If death must pay for life *why not take them*! \" Ah. So he was an arguer. \" Silence. \" A flick of my wrist enforced this commandment. An act neither evil nor good but merely convenient. \" I can not heal a great soul by slaying a damned one. Those accounts do not balance. To save a great soul a great soul must be slain. A great soul would be willing to Atone without getting something in return personally. You do not seek to Atone. You seek to barter. Begone. \" Hope died in his eyes as he turned to go. As he left the acolytes were already ushering in the next supplicant. \" Mother... I have come to Atone \".",
        "We study the quantum Hall effect in graphene at filling factors \\nu = 0 and\\nu = \\pm, concentrating on the quantum Hall ferromagnetic regime, within anon-perturbative bosonization formalism. We start by developing a bosonizationscheme for electrons with two discrete degrees of freedom (spin-1/2 andpseudospin-1/2) restricted to the lowest Landau level. Three distinct phasesare considered, namely the so-called spin-pseudospin, spin, and pseudospinphases. The first corresponds to a quarter-filled (\\nu =-1) while the others toa half-filled (\\nu = 0) lowest Landau level. In each case, we show that theelementary neutral excitations can be treated approximately as a set ofn-independent kinds of boson excitations. The boson representation of theprojected electron density, the spin, pseudospin, and mixed spin-pseudospindensity operators are derived. We then apply the developed formalism to theeffective continuous model, which includes SU(4) symmetry breaking terms,recently proposed by Alicea and Fisher. For each quantum Hall state, aneffective interacting boson model is derived and the dispersion relations ofthe elementary excitations are analytically calculated. We propose that thecharged excitations (quantum Hall skyrmions) can be described as a coherentstate of bosons. We calculate the semiclassical limit of the boson modelderived from the SU(4) invariant part of the original fermionic Hamiltonian andshow that it agrees with the results of Arovas and co-workers for SU(N) quantumHall skyrmions. We briefly discuss the influence of the SU(4) symmetry breakingterms in the skyrmion energy.",

And what were my plans for the day? Lie in bed and watch Netflix. Lame, I know, but it' s my life and I can do what I want, right? Unfortunately, three episodes of Breaking Bad in, my mom waltzed into my room unannounced and says, \" We' re going to the store. Get your lazybones up and going. \" Because I really wanted to go to the store, not on a day when my destiny was due to change. Still, arguing with my mom was like arguing with a wall, so I got dressed and sullenly got in the car.

It has a Half-Priced books, a Petland a Party City and a Tropical Trends. Yet, since I was forced to go shopping with my mom, I told her that I' d meet her later and proceed to the other half of the strip mall. I walked into the Half Priced books where a girl ( pretty, but not my type ) smiled from the counter and said hi. I looked around at the different books, rilfed through their game collection half-heartedly and decided on a pure whim to visit Petland. The sheer noise from the cats, dogs, birds, and human animals it was almost too much. Yet I persevered and walked around the cute animals. It was then that I saw her.

        "Maybe even decades.. . is that even possible? Well, either way, it's been awhile. So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner. nnAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower. As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night. Plus the Pirates were playing at 4: 05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game. nnWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table. Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful. Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers. We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest. \" In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell). I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer. I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking. So the $6. 95 10 beer sampler was well worth it. nnDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls. They were okay, but not quite what I expected. The spicy ranch was top notch, though. As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger. They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium). And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win! nnMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler. The glass container itself is sold for $12. 95. That's the empty price. To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5. Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me. So I walked out empty handed. But it won't deter me from returning.",

Since the Korner Pub has come under new ownership and cleared up the smoke, it's been recommended to me by countless South Hills dwellers. nnIf you're looking for a laid-back spot to grab a beer, watch the game, or play some pool, this is the place. The draft list is fantastic, with a wide range of crafts brews both local and national. I bugged out when I saw the prices. $13 growler fills? This is officially my new growler filling station. The prices are affordable, and the pub also offers cans and 6 packs to go. The menu also offers pitchers of all the drafts--a welcome choice when you bring a group or plan to stay for awhile. nnIf you're not a brew fan, I might not recommend this to you. The spot only offers beer, and there is no food sold here. I'm told you can bring in a meal--which is easy enough with several pizza joints nearby. nnThe space is really simple, with a main bar, a dart room, and the pool table in the back. I played a quick game of pool while polishing off a Nitro Mojo IPA. I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer, and made a promise to be back very soon.",

        "Mohammad Yaqub Haidari was nominated for the post by President Ashraf Ghani. However, it has emerged that he is on Interpol's most-wanted list for large scale tax evasion and fraud.The presidential office has told the BBC it is investigating whether the accusations against him are true.Interpol's website says Mr Haidari is wanted in Estonia for tax evasion.He is also accused of fraud linked to currency conversions.Mr Haidari told the BBC that he was the victim of a political conspiracy, and that he was being pursued by a criminal mafia.He said: \"They [Interpol] have mentioned in this document that they are pursuing me. I am not in hiding.\"He said that he would like to go to Estonia to \"defend his rights\".Estonian law enforcement officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday.According to Estonian media, Mr Haidari was investigated for embezzlement and tax evasion from the time when he was director of dairy firm Rapla Dairy. The company went bankrupt in 2003.Court proceedings began against Mr Haidari, and he eventually fled Estonia, local media said.He was sentenced in absentia to four years in prison in 2011, reports said.The news of the charges is an embarrassment for the new President Ghani, who wants to change the political culture in Afghanistan by appointing people who are both qualified and clean, the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul reports.No ministers are yet in place almost four months after the new Afghan government was sworn in, and there is a growing sense that the government is drifting, our correspondent adds.President Ghani announced his cabinet nominations on Monday some three months after he was sworn in, following tortuous negotiations with former rival and current government chief executive Abdullah Abdullah.",
        "The problem of resource allocation is studied for a two-user fadingorthogonal multiaccess relay channel (MARC) where both users (sources)communicate with a destination in the presence of a relay. A half-duplex relayis considered that transmits on a channel orthogonal to that used by thesources. The instantaneous fading state between every transmit-receive pair inthis network is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and receiver. Underan average power constraint at each source and the relay, the sum-rate for theachievable strategy of decode-and-forward (DF) is maximized over all powerallocations (policies) at the sources and relay. It is shown that the sum-ratemaximizing policy exploits the multiuser fading diversity to reveal theoptimality of opportunistic channel use by each user. A geometricinterpretation of the optimal power policy is also presented.",
        "We consider a brane world in an arbitrary number of dimensions without Z_2symmetry and derive the effective Einstein equation on the brane, where itsright-hand side is given by the matter on the brane and the curvature in thebulk. This is achieved by first deriving the junction conditions for a non-Z_2symmetric brane and second solving the Gauss equation, which relates the meanextrinsic curvature of the brane to the curvature in the bulk, with respect tothe mean extrinsic curvature. The latter corresponds to formulating an explicitjunction condition on the mean of the extrinsic curvature, analogue to theIsrael junction condition for the jump of the extrinsic curvature. We find thatthere appears a new type of an effective anisotropic fluid on the right-handside of the effective Einstein equation due to the fact that there is no Z_2symmetry. The derived equation is a basic equation for the study ofKaluza-Klein brane worlds in which some dimensions on the brane arecompactified or for a regularization scheme for a higher codimension braneworld, where the Kaluza-Klein compactification on the brane is regarded as ameans to regularize the uncontrollable spacetime singularity caused by thehigher codimension brane.",
        "This paper proposes the response surface method for finite element modelupdating. The response surface method is implemented by approximating thefinite element model surface response equation by a multi-layer perceptron. Theupdated parameters of the finite element model were calculated using geneticalgorithm by optimizing the surface response equation. The proposed method wascompared to the existing methods that use simulated annealing or geneticalgorithm together with a full finite element model for finite element modelupdating. The proposed method was tested on an unsymmetri-cal H-shapedstructure. It was observed that the proposed method gave the updated naturalfrequen-cies and mode shapes that were of the same order of accuracy as thosegiven by simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. Furthermore, it wasobserved that the response surface method achieved these results at acomputational speed that was more than 2.5 times as fast as the geneticalgorithm and a full finite element model and 24 times faster than thesimulated annealing.",
        "This was it, the threshold. The Helix Nebula, commonly known as' The Eye of God'. The name was a relic of a long dead culture on Earth. I thought back to the Cosmodrome from which millions of explorers such as myself had been sent into the deepest reaches of space, most of whom would never return. I remembered what the Great Researchers had told us *Forward, brothers, the sky is red* they had shouted into the legions of men with great thunderous voices. This was the threshold of something *more*, something *greater* than everything we could have imagined. The Eye of God lay before me, despite being nothing but a nebula one could almost *feel* it piercing the depths of their soul. But something seemed off, something I had not noticed in my hours staring into its depths from my craft. A black, all encompassing shadow was swallowing the nebula from the top and bottom. Had I just witnessed the death of a nebula? No. It was something far greater than I could have ever imagined. The nebula *opened* again, it had *blinked*. Was this some sort of anomaly? Or had I just witnessed something from a separate plane of existence? I do n' t know. But the nebula *blinked*, I saw it with my own eyes. And I would likely be the only person to behold such a sight for the rest of time. I was at the center of the Bootes Void and would likely never see another human for the rest of my life, my craft would drift throughout the void for all of time. I would never be able to inform the Great Researchers of my discovery, I would die alone in the Void with no accomplishments except this. I had seen a nebula blink, now that I think about it... Was the Helix Nebula even a nebula to begin with, or was it part of some great interstellar being? I will never know.",

        "The animals hunt with clicks and buzzes - and pick up the echoes from the animals they hope to eat.Researchers at Denmark's Aarhus University say they switch from a narrow to a wide beam of sound - \"like adjusting a flashlight\" - as they home in on a fish.The researchers believe this could stop the prey of porpoises, whales and dolphins avoiding capture.They also think that by revealing these acoustic secrets, they could come up with new ways to prevent porpoises, and other toothed whales, from becoming trapped in fishing nets.Lead researcher Danuta Wisniewska and her colleagues worked with harbour porpoises in a semi-natural enclosure on the coast of Denmark.In this unique environment, the researchers were able to fit the porpoises with sound-detecting tags, and to place lots of microphones to pick up sound around their enclosure.\"The animals still have access to the seafloor and are only separated from the harbour by a net. Fish are able to come in, so they're still hunting.\"The team carried out a series of experiments to work out where the sound energy the porpoises produced was directedIn one experiment, researchers dropped fish into the water to tempt the porpoises to hunt.Underwater huntersAccording to the study, the porpoises were able to broaden their beam by as much as 50% in the final phase of attack.They were able to switch between a narrow and a wide beam.This fine-tuning ability is controlled by a fatty structure in their forehead, called the melon, which acts as a sort of \"sound lens\".The harbour porpoises involved in this study had been rescued after being caught in fishing nets.The researchers hope this work will develop ways of using sound to prevent porpoises from accidentally chasing fish into these nets.",

        "Two different approaches to calculate the fusion rules of the c_{p,1} seriesof logarithmic conformal field theories are discussed. Both are based on themodular transformation properties of a basis of chiral vacuum torus amplitudes,which contains the characters of the irreducible representations. One of theseis an extension, which we develop here for a non-semisimple generalisation ofthe Verlinde formula introduced by Fuchs et al., to include fusion productswith indecomposable representations. The other uses the Verlinde formula in itsusual form and gets the fusion coefficients in the limit, in which the basis oftorus amplitudes degenerates to the linear dependent set of characters ofirreducible and indecomposable representations. We discuss the effects, whichthis linear dependence has on any result for fusion rules, which are calculatedfrom these character's modular transformation properties. We show that the twopresented methods are equivalent. Furthermore we calculate explicit BPZ-likeexpressions for the resulting fusion rules for all p larger than 2.",

        "The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networkshas uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of thesenetworked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a moredetailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type ofnetwork growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and proposean evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on networkstructure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, networkstructure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution ofthe network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as theintensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivialdisassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result ofnetwork evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deletingintroduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing networkso long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-worldeffect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clusteringcoefficient in a network.",

        "Binary microlensing light curves have a variety of morphologies. Many areindistinguishable from point lens light curves. Of those that deviate from thepoint lens form, caustic crossing light curves have tended to dominateidentified binary lens events. Other distinctive signatures of binary lensesinclude significant asymmetry, multiple peaks, and repeating events. We havequantified, using high resolution simulations, the theoretically expectedrelative numbers of each type of binary lens event, based on its measurablecharacteristics. We find that a microlensing survey with current levels ofphotometric uncertainty and sampling should find at least as many non-causticcrossing binary lens events as caustic crossing events; in future surveys withmore sensitive photometry, the contribution of distinctive non-caustic crossingevents will be even greater. To try to explain why caustic crossing lightcurves appear to be so dominant among the published binary lensing events, weinvestigate the influence of several physical effects, including blending,sampling rate, and various binary populations.",

Being that it is a pharmacy, there wouldn't be a back door or windows, so the lot has a feeling of dangerous seclusion. nnInside the store, everything I saw told me that \"this is a pharmacy that is in a rough neighborhood\": shelves are only about 4'6\" tall (presumably so workers can see what people are doing in the aisles); bizarre things are locked in cabinets with clear covers (regular brands of shampoo?! ); beauty items regularly updated, weren't (I, er, have a nail polish problem; some of the products were about 4 seasons behind and quite a few polishes were separated); it feels like there isn't enough room for the products, which are disorganized and crammed onto shelves (reference the odd shelf height limitation). nnIf you can spare the gas and time, there is another a CVS on Center Ave within a mile or so or a Walgreen's (Penn Circ S+Trade St. ) and a Rite Aid (Baum+Negley) within 1/2 mile.",

        "Humanity has a funny way of putting off fixing anything until that something is standing in their backyard carrying a shotgun. Global warming, super viruses, global drought - all of these things humanity was happy to push off onto the next generation, keeping them out of sight and out of mind so they could focus on staring into a screen with their fingers in their ears while the world crumbles around them. So it stood to reason that in the early years of the 21st century, when the great exodus occurred, a mass migration of four billions souls that would return in two hundred years time, humanity was willing to brush it off on the next generation. And the next. And the next. See, the funny thing was that the plan would have worked, earth would have been saved by the exodus, if it had n' t already been too late. Even with half the population suddenly absent there still was n' t enough water, food, and farmable climate to sustain them, and they slowly died off. The survivors began to tell tails of the saviors, and angels who would come and take them with them on their great ships into the stars where they could live without threat of starvation. Then that fateful day came. Two hundred years after the exodus the great ships appeared in the sky of earth in a flash. The cults dedicated to their saviors return called out in joy, dancing in the streets. Finally they could leave their hellhole, their misery, and join the angels. Unfortunately for them that is what the ships also saw. A hellhole. It only took a brief scan of the planet for them to realize that there was nothing for them here. The world they were banished from had done them a favor. And just like that, as quickly as they had arrived the ships winked out of the skies back into the cosmos, leaving the world that damned them to their own hell, victims of their own laziness.",
        "We have measured resonance strengths and energies for dielectronicrecombination (DR) of Mg-like Fe XV forming Al-like Fe XIV via N=3 -> N' = 3core excitations in the electron-ion collision energy range 0-45 eV. Allmeasurements were carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the MaxPlanck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. We have alsocarried out new multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations using theAUTOSTRUCTURE code. For electron-ion collision energies < 25 eV we find pooragreement between our experimental and theoretical resonance energies andstrengths. From 25 to 42 eV we find good agreement between the two forresonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonancestrengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger thanour estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26%(at a 90% confidence level). Above 42 eV the difference in the shape betweenthe calculated and measured 3s3p(^1P_1)nl DR series limit we attribute partlyto the nl dependence of the detection probabilities of high Rydberg states inthe experiment. We have used our measurements, supplemented by ourAUTOSTRUCTURE calculations, to produce a Maxwellian-averaged 3 -> 3 DR ratecoefficient for Fe XV forming Fe XIV. The resulting rate coefficient isestimated to be accurate to better than +/- 29% (at a 90% confidence level) fork_BT_e > 1 eV. At temperatures of k_BT_e ~ 2.5-15 eV, where Fe XV is predictedto form in photoionized plasmas, significant discrepancies are found betweenour experimentally-derived rate coefficient and previously publishedtheoretical results. Our new MCBP plasma rate coefficient is 19-28% smallerthan our experimental results over this temperature range.",

The calamari appetizer was good, but not worth $11. 00. The hummus appetizer was 2 golf ball sized clumps with almost no flavor. Not even arranged to be appealing to the eye. My tenderloin was nothing to write home about and the risotto was a mushy, tasteless,  glob with Carmelized onions on it that looked reheated.. . also not  flavorful. The baked in house bread were blah, and butter was not offered. It could have used it to help the taste. Dessert was the same.. . an amaretto cheesecake that tasted like it was left in the oven way too long.. .. dry. I love good food. But, this evening was an utter disappointment. It was a birthday celebration, and I did not want to spoil it with complaints about the food. I also think my guest did not want me to feel bad for bringing them to this place I raved about prior to going. Service was great, but the server talked me out of a couple of things I considered getting. Made me think whomever was doing the cooking that night.. . A Saturday was not good at certain things. Extremely overpriced. Btw.. . coffee was $6. 50. C'mon now! Good but not that much! Sorry, but I will not go back.

        "We study the prospects for detecting Weakly Interacting Massive Particles(WIMPs), in a number of phenomenological scenarios, with a detector composed ofa target simultaneously sensitive to both spin-dependent and spin-independentcouplings, as is the case of COUPP (Chicagoland Observatory for UndergroundParticle Physics). First, we show that sensitivity to both couplings optimizeschances of initial WIMP detection. Second, we demonstrate that in case ofdetection, comparison of the signal on two complementary targets, such as inCOUPP CF3I and C4F10 bubble chambers, allows a significantly more precisedetermination of the dark matter axial and scalar couplings. This strategywould provide crucial information on the nature of the WIMPs, and possiblyallow discrimination between neutralino and Kaluza-Klein dark matter.",

It was far larger and more muscular than the right foot, as well as having much darker skin.

        "The electronic density of states of graphene is equivalent to that ofrelativistic electrons. In the absence of disorder or external doping the Fermienergy lies at the Dirac point where the density of states vanishes. Althoughtransport measurements at high carrier densities indicate rather highmobilities, many questions pertaining to disorder remain unanswered. Inparticular, it has been argued theoretically, that when the average carrierdensity is zero, the inescapable presence of disorder will lead to electron andhole puddles with equal probability. In this work, we use a scanning singleelectron transistor to image the carrier density landscape of graphene in thevicinity of the neutrality point. Our results clearly show the electron-holepuddles expected theoretically. In addition, our measurement technique enablesto determine locally the density of states in graphene. In contrast topreviously studied massive two dimensional electron systems, the kineticcontribution to the density of states accounts quantitatively for the measuredsignal. Our results suggests that exchange and correlation effects are eitherweak or have canceling contributions.",
        "The numerical analysis of strongly interacting nanostructures requirespowerful techniques. Recently developed methods, such as the time-dependentdensity matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) approach or the embedded-clusterapproximation (ECA), rely on the numerical solution of clusters of finite size.For the interpretation of numerical results, it is therefore crucial tounderstand finite-size effects in detail. In this work, we present a carefulfinite-size analysis for the examples of one quantum dot, as well as threeserially connected quantum dots. Depending on odd-even effects, physicallyquite different results may emerge from clusters that do not differ much intheir size. We provide a solution to a recent controversy over results obtainedwith ECA for three quantum dots. In particular, using the optimum clustersdiscussed in this paper, the parameter range in which ECA can reliably beapplied is increased, as we show for the case of three quantum dots. As apractical procedure, we propose that a comparison of results for staticquantities against those of quasi-exact methods, such as the ground-statedensity matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method or exact diagonalization,serves to identify the optimum cluster type. In the examples studied here, wefind that to observe signatures of the Kondo effect in finite systems, the bestclusters involving dots and leads must have a total z-component of the spinequal to zero.",
        "A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a ratherunexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knotsare extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to proteinfunction in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete ProteinData Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discoveredones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the mostcomplex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest thatits entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by theproteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species andsometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which onlyappears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins ofsimilar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in theenzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of ashort DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into aknotted structure in this protein.",

        "We identify plain evaporation of ions as the fundamental loss mechanism outof a multipole ion trap. Using thermalized negative Cl- ions we find that theevaporative loss rate is proportional to a Boltzmann factor. This thermodynamicdescription sheds new light on the dynamics of particles in time-varyingconfining potentials. It specifically allows us to extract the effective depthof the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of therf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion ofthe trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motionand the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes,however, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur atlarge trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume.In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude. Wegive an analytical parameterization of the trap depth for various multipoletraps that allows predictions of the most favorable trapping conditions.",
        "Germany has dropped below Japan to have not just the lowest birth rate across Europe but also globally, according to the report by Germany-based analysts.Its authors warned of the effects of a shrinking working-age population.They said women's participation in the workforce would be key to the country's economic future.In Germany, an average of 8.2 children were born per 1,000 inhabitants over the past five years, according to the study by German auditing firm BDO with the Hamburg Institute of International Economics (HWWI).It said Japan saw 8.4 children born per 1,000 inhabitants over the same time period.In Europe, Portugal and Italy came in second and third with an average of 9.0 and 9.3 children, respectively. France and the UK both had an average of 12.7 births per 1,000 inhabitants.Meanwhile, the highest birth rates were in Africa, with Niger at the top of the list with 50 births per 1,000 people.Germany's falling birth rate means the percentage of people of working age in the country - between 20 and 65 - would drop from 61% to 54% by 2030, Henning Voepel, director of the HWWI, said in a statement (in German).Arno Probst, a BDO board member, said employers in Germany faced higher wage costs as a result.\"Without strong labour markets, Germany cannot maintain its economic edge in the long run,\" he added.Experts disagree over the reasons for Germany's low birth rate, as well as the ways to tackle the situation.Mr Probst said the country would need young immigrant workers to fill the significant skills gap. And more women were needed in the workforce to avoid economic problems.Germany has one of the highest migration rates in the world, but has also seen growing support for anti-immigration party Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD).The latest birth rate figures comes despite efforts by Mrs Merkel's government to invest in childcare support.",
        "Context: L'-band (3.8 micron) images of the Galactic Center show a largenumber of thin filaments in the mini-spiral, located west of the mini-cavityand along the inner edge of the Northern Arm. One possible mechanism that couldproduce such structures is the interaction of a central wind with themini-spiral. Additionally, we identify similar features that appear to beassociated with stars. Aims: We present the first proper motion measurements ofthe thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around SgrA* andinvestigate possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the observedmotions. Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACOadaptive optics system at the ESO VLT. The images have been transformed to acommon coordinate system and features of interest were extracted. Then across-correlation technique could be performed in order to determine theoffsets between the features with respect to their position in the referenceepoch. Results: We derive the proper motions of a number of filaments and 2cometary shaped dusty sources close (in projection) to SgrA*. We show that theshape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerianmotion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at theposition of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible fortheir formation and motion. We argue that the properties of the filaments areprobably related to an outflow from the disk of young mass-losing stars aroundSgrA*. In part, the outflow may originate from the black hole itself. We alsopresent some evidence and theoretical considerations that the outflow may becollimated.",

We weren't trying to hide anything. I just don't think I read the questionnaire correctly.\"Media playback is not supported on this devicePacquiao blamed his injury for his points defeat to undefeated Mayweather, 38, claiming it stopped him using his right hand.His camp claimed Usada had been notified of his treatment and plans for an anti-inflammatory shot on fight night.But Usada was only charged with monitoring anti-doping issues and NAC officials prevented the injection, saying they had not been told about Pacquaio's shoulder issue.No date has been set for surgery to repair the \"significant tear\" and although Pacquiao will face up to a year out, ESPN claims Mayweather is open to a re-match in 12 months time.Mayweather scored a unanimous points victory in the four-belt unification bout at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the win extending the American's unbeaten record as a professional to 48 fights.He has said he intends to retire after one more fight, possibly in September, with Britain's Amir Khan among the potential opponents.",
        "We present the results of photoionization modeling of nine weak MgII (W_r<0.3Ang) quasar absorption line systems with redshifts 1.4<z<2.4 obtained with theUltraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope. Thesesystems have been chosen because they provide access to a regime of red-shiftspace that previous weak MgII studies have not looked at. The densities,metallicities, Doppler parameters, and column densities of these systems arecompared to those of other weak MgII systems at lower redshift. There is nosignificant statistical variation in the properties of the absorbers over theredshift range 0.4<z<2.4. The number density per unit redshift is known todecrease for weak MgII absorbers between z~1 and z~2 by a greater amount thanpredicted from cosmological effects and changes in the extragalactic ionizingbackground alone. We suggest that, because the physical properties of theabsorber population are not seen to change significantly across this range,that the evolution in dN/dz is due to a decrease in the activity that givesrise to weak MgII absorption, and not due to a change in the processes thatform weak MgII absorbers. The presence of separate, but aligned (in velocity)low and high density clouds in all single cloud weak MgII absorbers provides animportant diagnostic of their geometry. We discuss possible origins in dwarfgalaxies and in extragalactic analogs to high velocity clouds.",
        "We present a general procedure for obtaining the coefficients of the scalarbubble and triangle integral functions of one-loop amplitudes. Coefficients areextracted by considering two-particle and triple unitarity cuts of thecorresponding bubble and triangle integral functions. After choosing a specificparameterisation of the cut loop momentum we can uniquely identify thecoefficients of the desired integral functions simply by examining thebehaviour of the cut integrand as the unconstrained parameters of the cut loopmomentum approach infinity. In this way we can produce compact forms for scalarintegral coefficients. Applications of this method are presented for both QCDand electroweak processes, including an alternative form for the recentlycomputed three-mass triangle coefficient in the six-photon amplitude$A_6(1^-,2^+,3^-,4^+,5^-,6^+)$. The direct nature of this extraction procedureallows for a very straightforward automation of the procedure.",

        "nnI ordered the General Tso tofu, a favorite dish of mine, and hubby ordered the beef Mei Fun noodles. We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food. nnThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls. nnSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great. If you're looking for a quick fix to your Chinese food craving, this is a good place to order from, although I'll be going back to Uncle Chen before I try China Sea again.",
        "I got my math degree here, and I feel my educations was average at best, so why did I pay twice as much? They don't have rigorous science programs here, and even their beloved pharmacy school seems to be self-serving to artificially inflate graduation rates. nn The money does not go to the professors -- many of them are part-time adjuncts who do not earn much, so despite small classrooms, they are burnt out and don't have time to devote to their lesson plans. I do not support this unethical business practice. nnThe campus itself is garbage, there were cockroaches all through the dorms and food quarters when I was there 2006-2010, the dorms are old and falling apart, there is no campus life to speak of. nnIn general there is just really no reason to come here and pay twice as much money for this garbage school. I left this school 60k in debt and could have gotten the same or better education elsewhere - I DO NOT recommend this school.",
        "I feel I can adequately judge the quality of BBQ. This particular establishment was unique in that it's right off the side of a highway and has drive-in microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50's. I did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town, but not a big deal. I ordered the 1/4 Barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries. In addition I ordered a \"Minced\" barbecue sandwich, which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about North Carolina style BBQ. nnFirst let me say that FoodNetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50's style drive-in and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chicken are prepared. They are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce. I will say that it is unique; however as the above would suggest, it is quite greasy. It was \"okay\" but I wouldn't say it is anything to specifically come here for. nnAs for the barbecue, it is also \"okay;\" I can safely say that the meat is not smoked (there is no smoke rising from the kitchen, so I don't see how that could happen). In addition, the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky flavor characteristic of good, slow cooked North Carolina barbecue. The sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of NC BBQ than what I received from Mac's (which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavor), but unfortunately I would never recommend the restaurant for NC barbecue or otherwise.",
        "The Italians have acquired the club from Laurence Bassini, who bought the Hornets 15 months ago when he fronted Watford FC Limited's £440,000 takeover.Administrator Andrew Andronikou, who advised the Hornets on the sale, said: \"We are delighted to have ensured that Watford's immediate future is safe.\"The family have a proven track record of building successful teams on the field, and balancing the books off it.\"Andronikou added: \"This transaction is a significant one, as it provides the Pozzo football dynasty with a secure platform to introduce its successful formula to the UK.\"Giampaolo Pozzo has owned Serie A side Udinese since 1986 and bought Spanish La Liga outfit Granada three years ago, but his son Gino is expected to take charge at Vicarage Road.Former West Ham boss Gianfranco Zola is known to be admired by the Pozzo family, who have also been impressed with the Championship club's youth academy set-up, and they are giving strong consideration to recruiting the Italian as manager for next season.Current Watford manager Sean Dyche led the club to their highest league position for four years in his debut season, but is said to be \"aware of the situation\".Former West Ham chief executive Scott Duxbury is also likely to accept a role within the new regime at Vicarage Road.Duxbury and Zola have a strong relationship from their days at Upton Park, but it remains to be seen if they will link up again at Watford.A week ago the Hornets denied claims by Bassini that the takeover deal was off.His tenure at Vicarage Road has seen the club exceed expectations under Dyche, but Bassini has been reluctant to face the media and had a public fall-out with former chairman Graham Taylor.",
        "As I ran from building to building, I saw him again. The man. He was there, standing, watching me. Never interfering, but always there, observing my every move. I ran and jumped my way over to him but the closer I got, the less vivid the dream became until I woke. The man had been in all of my dreams recently. He was a tall man, who wore the same clothes each time: a long black coat with glasses. Bushy eyebrows, receding hairline and large eyes. Every time I see him, I get goosebumps and this strange eerie feeling. I' m a lucid dreamer. I can do pretty much whatever I want. Fly to space? Done. Build a city? Done that too. But this man, I ca n' t control. I ca n' t Move him, touch him, I ca n' t even go near him because my dream just collapses. Another day passed, and tonight I dreamed I was in a taxi. I did n' t have as strict control as I usually do. While I was sitting in the back of the taxi, we came to a crossroad, however another car was coming at us at full speed and it was n' t slowing. I braced for impact as surely this was the end. Nothing came to hit me. I turned my head and looked out the window, only to see the man standing there watching me. Many more times, the man was there to save my life in dreams. Then, one day, in the real world while I was walking to work, an armed robber threatened me with a gun. I told him I had no money but he did n' t believe me. He grabbed me and searched for my wallet. I fell to the ground, resisting him. He was about to fire, but then, just like in my dreams, the man just appeared right there. The robber fired, and the man fell. The robber ran, confused and horrified. The man had saved my life once more.",

        "Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative transmission (CT) haverecently emerged as communication techniques that can make effective use ofcollaborative/cooperative nodes to create a virtualmultiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) system. Extending the lifetime ofnetworks composed of battery-operated nodes is a key issue in the design andoperation of wireless sensor networks. This paper considers the effects onnetwork lifetime of allowing closely located nodes to use CB/CT to reduce theload or even to avoid packet-forwarding requests to nodes that have criticalbattery life. First, the effectiveness of CB/CT in improving the signalstrength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes is studied.Then, the performance improvement obtained by this technique is analyzed for aspecial 2D disk case. Further, for general networks in whichinformation-generation rates are fixed, a new routing problem is formulated asa linear programming problem, while for other general networks, the cost forrouting is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining andthe effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and the simulation results, it isseen that the proposed method can reduce the payloads of energy-depleting nodesby about 90% in the special case network considered and improve the lifetimesof general networks by about 10%, compared with existing techniques.",
        "The two and three-body correlation functions of the ground state of anoptically trapped ultracold spin-1/2 Fermi gas (SFG) in a tight waveguide (1Dregime) are calculated in the plane of even and odd-wave coupling constants,assuming a 1D attractive zero-range odd-wave interaction induced by a 3D p-waveFeshbach resonance, as well as the usual repulsive zero-range even-waveinteraction stemming from 3D s-wave scattering. The calculations are based onthe exact mapping from the SFG to a ``Lieb-Liniger-Heisenberg'' model withdelta-function repulsions depending on isotropic Heisenberg spin-spininteractions, and indicate that the SFG should be stable against three-bodyrecombination in a large region of the coupling constant plane encompassingparts of both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. However, thelimiting case of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas (FTG), a spin-aligned 1DFermi gas with infinitely attractive p-wave interactions, is unstable in thissense. Effects due to the dipolar interaction and a Zeeman term due to aresonance-generating magnetic field do not lead to shrinkage of the region ofstability of the SFG.",

Both were excellent. nSecond course was the main entree:  sliced turkey breast, stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy, plus our choice of veggie. We had whipped potatoes and green beans. nEverything was very good. nThe last course was dessert, which we got to go. The choices were pumpkin or chocolate pecan pie. We both chose the pecan pie. nAt home later that evening, we learned that this dessert was nothing more than store-bought pumpkin pie with chocolate chips pressed into the top. The crust was awful, and had the tell-tale pattern of a machine-made pastry. nReally?! nI am disappointed that a high-end steakhouse does not have a pastry chef. I left The Palm in L.

        "This paper extends and builds upon the results of an earlier paper, in whichwe described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deformgeometrically-engineered grand unified models into ones with lower symmetry.This top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions ofsingularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related byonly a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. Andbecause the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute thesuperpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness ofgeometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case ofdeforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Modelcontent. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometricallyengineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how thethree families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of asingle, isolated E8 singularity.",
        "Mass loss rate formulae are derived from observations or from suites ofmodels. For theoretical models, the following have all been identified asfactors greatly influencing the atmospheric structure and mass loss rates:Pulsation with piston amplitude scaling appropriately with stellar L; dustnucleation and growth, with radiation pressure and grain-gas interactions andappropriate dependence on temperature and density; non-grey opacity with atleast 51 frequency samples; non-LTE and departures from radiative equilibriumin the compressed and expanding flows; and non-equilibrium processes affectingthe composition (grain formation; molecular chemistry). No one set of modelsyet includes all the factors known to be important. In fact, it is verydifficult to construct a model that can simultaneously include these factorsand be useful for computing spectra. Therefore, although theoretical modelgrids are needed to separate the effects of M,L,R and/or $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ orZ on the mass loss rates, these models must be carefully checked againstobservations. Getting the right order of magnitude for the mass loss rate isonly the first step in such a comparison, and is not sufficient to determinewhether the mass loss formula is correct. However, there are observables thatdo test the validity of mass loss formulae as they depend directly on $d\\log\\dot M/d\\log L$, $d\\log \\dot M/d\\log R$, or $d\\log \\dot M/d\\log P$.",

By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.

The live band that they had was very good, playing the usual popular classics (3am, Sweet Home Alabama, Play That Funky Music, Don't Stop Believing, etc). I think what impressed me the most this night was the upgrade in the music selection. They went way beyond the typical top 40 that they usually play when the live band isn't performing.

        "A study of the $p d \\to p d \\eta$ reaction in the energy range where therecent data from Uppsala are available, is done in the two-step model of $\\eta$production including the final state interaction. The $\\eta -d$ final stateinteraction is incorporated through the solution of the Lippmann Schwingerequation using an elastic scattering matrix element, $T_{\\eta d \\to \\eta d}$,which is required to be half off-shell. It is written in a factorized form,with an off-shell form factor multiplying an on-shell part given by aneffective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum. The parameters ofthis expansion have been taken from an existing recent relativistic Faddeevequation solution for the $\\eta NN$ system corresponding to different $\\eta-N$scattering amplitudes. Calculations have also been done using few bodyequations within a finite rank approximation (FRA) to generate $T_{\\eta d \\to\\eta d}$. The $p-d$ final state interaction is included in the spirit of theWatson-Migdal prescription by multiplying the matrix element by the inverse ofthe Jost function. The $\\eta-d$ interaction is found to be dominant in theregion of small invariant $\\eta -d$ mass, $M_{\\eta d}$. The $p-d$ interactionenhances the cross section in the whole region of $M_{\\eta d}$, but is largerfor large $M_{\\eta d}$. We find nearly isotropic angular distributions of theproton and the deuteron in the final state. All the above observations are inagreement with data.

        "We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in themerging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments.We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data.{\\it Marginally consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with atotal mass M_{CDM} = 1 x 10^{15}Msun of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can movewith V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the \"bullet\" X-ray gas can move withV_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\\it maximum speeds} that areaccelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time evenwithout the ram pressure.

Models withV_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas.

        "In this paper, we model the evolution and self-assembly of randomly orientedcarbon nanotubes (CNTs), grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thinfilm for field emission under diode configuration. Despite high output, thecurrent in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paperis focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics basedmodelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model fordegradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed todecay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of theCNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain theself-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical forceare employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current atthe device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation andintegration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. Thesimulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results. Basedon the developed model, numerical simulations aimed at understanding theeffects of various geometric parameters and their statistical features on thedevice current history are reported.",
        "We study the possibility that the mutual interactions between Jupiter andSaturn prevented Type II migration from driving these planets much closer tothe Sun. Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove (2001), byexploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using anew hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscousevolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, andSaturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end uplocked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, theresonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets inthe disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance forthe two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration.If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped orreversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height,this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks.

        "In this paper, we investigate the linearity versus non-linearity of the LargeMagellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheid period-luminosity (P-L) relation using twostatistical approaches not previously applied to this problem: the testimatormethod and the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC). The testimator method isextended to multiple stages for the first time, shown to be unbiased and thevariance of the estimated slope can be proved to be smaller than the standardslope estimated from linear regression theory. The Schwarz InformationCriterion (also known as the Bayesian Information Criterion) is moreconservative than the Akaike Information Criterion and tends to choose lowerorder models. By using simulated data sets, we verify that these statisticaltechniques can be used to detect intrinsically linear and/or non-linear P-Lrelations. These methods are then applied to independent LMC Cepheid data setsfrom the OGLE project and the MACHO project, respectively. Our results implythat there is a change of slope in longer period ranges for all of the datasets.

Inside it's classic diner, through and through. We (4 of us) were seated at a small booth. It was cozy to say the least. nnKatie K. and I split a Chocolate Shake ($6) to start off. It's what you'd expect from the setting, served in a metal tin and absolutely delicious.

This dish was just missing a wow-factor (in addition to the Oxford-comma). I love goat cheese, and expected so much with it melted between two pieces of sourdough and chicken, bacon, and tomato. But none of the flavors that should've been present stood out. The salty bacon was lost in the grease of the bread. There may not have been any tomato. The chicken was bland. nnI loved the shake, and the sandwich was by no means bad, but there was no warm-feeling deliciousness I expected from a meal in such a diner.

Yes. Yes, please. Because it was just me, I didn't call ahead or anything - but hoped for a spot in the bar/seat yourself section. This place was packed full of people.

I heard Mandy tell one of the other servers that the bloomin' onions were being picked up left and right in the kitchen, regardless of ticket. It seemed like Outback was having some trouble with the demand. Mandy actually flagged down a server with an onion and told her to give it to me. I really appreciated that! Sometimes I get skipped or forgotten about when I'm eating out on my own. Not this time! Basically, everything was delicious. Onion was crispy and hot, shrimp Caesar salad was perfect. I took a to-go box for my onion, and forgot it when I left (like I usually do). Mandy chased me out the door, onion in hand and asked if I still wanted it! I know that she was crazy busy in there, taking time like that is impressive! nnI'll definitely be back, probably sitting in the shark infested bar section.",
        "We present the projected velocity dispersion profile for the remote(d=233kpc) Galactic dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy Leo II, based on 171discrete stellar radial velocities that were obtained from medium-resolutionspectroscopy using the FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectrograph at the European SouthernObservatory, Chile. The dispersion profile of those stars with good membershipprobabilities is essentially flat with an amplitude of 6.6+-0.7 km/s over thefull radial extent of our data, which probe to the stellar boundary of thisgalaxy. We find no evidence of any significant apparent rotation or velocityasymmetry which suggests that tidal effects cannot be invoked to explain LeoII's properties. From basic mass modeling, employing Jeans' equation, we derivea mass out to the limiting radius of (2.7+-0.5) 10^7 Msun and a global mass tolight ratio of 27-45 in solar units, depending on the adopted total luminosity.A cored halo profile and a mild amount of tangential velocity anisotropy isfound to account well for Leo II's observed kinematics, although we cannotexclude the possibility of a cusped halo with radially varying velocityanisotropy. All in all, this galaxy exhibits dark matter properties whichappear to be concordant with the other dSph satellites of the Milky Way, namelya halo mass profile which is consistent with a central core and a total masswhich is similar to the common mass scale seen in other dSphs.",
        "Kination dominated quintessence models of dark energy have the intriguingfeature that the relic abundance of thermal cold dark matter can besignificantly enhanced compared to the predictions from standard cosmology.Previous treatments of such models do not include a realistic embedding ofinflationary initial conditions. We remedy this situation by constructing aviable inflationary model in which the inflaton and quintessence field are thesame scalar degree of freedom. Kination domination is achieved after inflationthrough a strong push or \"kick\" of the inflaton, and sufficient reheating canbe achieved depending on model parameters. This allows us to explore bothmodel-dependent and model-independent cosmological predictions of thisscenario. We find that measurements of the B-mode CMB polarization can rule outthis class of scenarios almost model independently. We also discuss otherexperimentally accessible signatures for this class of models.",

        "Potato croquette! Curry katsu! There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene! nnYes, the previous reviews are spot on-- authentic Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls) in a super charming space (Don't be thrown off by it's location next to the Little Caesars. ) with friendly family-run service. )nnThis place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind like Ru San's) which is always a good sign. nnTIP: Get the lunch special A or B. You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant. The special is $8 and is plenty of food. (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box. ) nnTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page. However, who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't good? nn(If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own.. . and nobody knows! In fact, it's pretty good, considering. ) nnI also don't think the service is unfriendly at all! Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness.. .

She went so far as to blame my youngest sister' s secondary infertility on my mom' s actions. Jane went on to say that Mom should come to each of us and beg for forgiveness. I could not disagree more, we are commanded to honor our parents. I can not speak for my other two sisters, but I would rather have never known. I feel no anger toward my mother for this, just sadness for her and the shame and guilt she she must have felt all these years. I will never broach the subject to her. It would be too hard to see her cry.",

        "We address two issues in the thermodynamic model for nuclear disassembly.Surprisingly large differences in results for specific heat were seen inpredictions from the canonical and grand canonical ensembles when the nuclearsystem passes from liquid-gas co-existence to the pure gas phase. We are ableto pinpoint and understand the reasons for such and other discrepancies whenthey appear. There is a subtle but important difference in the physicsaddressed in the two models. In particular if we reformulate the parameters inthe canonical model to better approximate the physics addressed in the grandcanonical model, calculations for observables converge. Next we turn to theissue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment inboth canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We demonstrate that thisdistribution is very closely related to average multiplicities. Therelationship of the bimodal distribution to phase transition is discussed.",

        "Any homogeneous polynomial $P(x, y, z)$ of degree $d$, being restricted to aunit sphere $S^2$, admits essentially a unique representation of the form$\\lambda + \\sum_{k = 1}^d [\\prod_{j = 1}^k L_{kj}]$, where $L_{kj}$'s arelinear forms in $x, y$ and $z$ and $\\lambda$ is a real number. The coefficientsof these linear forms, viewed as 3D vectors, are called \\emph{multipole}vectors of $P$. In this paper we consider similar multipole representations ofpolynomial and analytic functions on other quadratic surfaces $Q(x, y, z) = c$,real and complex. Over the complex numbers, the above representation is notunique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate thecombinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with someclassical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositionsof functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classicaltheorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator$\\Delta_{S^2}$) to more general differential operators $\\Delta_Q$ that areconstructed with the help of the quadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introducemodular spaces of multipoles. We study their intricate geometry and topologyusing methods of algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The multipolespaces are ramified over vector or projective spaces, and the compliments tothe ramification sets give rise to a rich family of $K(\\pi, 1)$-spaces, where$\\pi$ runs over a variety of modified braid groups.",

Let me also say how hard it was to find this place. Granted, it was raining and dark, but their sign was not lit and was hard to see amoungst the other places in this strip/suite mall. I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold, rainy night and it sounded very comfortable, like memories from college days. The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles. I don't eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good, but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll. The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers! We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent. Overall this place was just ok. I may be back for some take out ramen but honestly I could probably just make my own at home for 95 cents and add some veggies.",

        "The observed association of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with peculiar TypeIc supernovae gives support to Woosley`s collapsar/hypernova model, in whichthe GRB is produced by the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massivestar to a black hole. The association of LGRBs with small star-forming galaxiessuggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to thecollapsar stage. Both completely-mixed single star models and binary starmodels are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massivehelium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization duringcore-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a fewmillennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequentevolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequencecompanions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium starsin close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite thestrong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retainsufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.",
        "We derive the equation of matter density perturbations on sub-horizon scalesfor a general Lagrangian density f(R, phi, X) that is a function of a Ricciscalar R, a scalar field phi and a kinetic term X=-(nabla phi)^2/2. This isuseful to constrain modified gravity dark energy models from observations oflarge-scale structure and weak lensing. We obtain the solutions for the matterperturbation delta_m as well as the gravitational potential Phi for someanalytically solvable models. In a f(R) dark energy model with the Lagrangiandensity f(R)=alpha R^{1+m}-Lambda, the growth rates of perturbations exhibitnotable differences from those in the standard Einstein gravity unless m isvery close to 0. In scalar-tensor models with the Lagrangian densityf=F(phi)R+2p(phi,X) we relate the models with coupled dark energy scenarios inthe Einstein frame and reproduce the equations of perturbations known in thecurrent literature by making a conformal transformation. We also estimate theevolution of perturbations in both Jordan and Einstein frames when the energyfraction of dark energy is constant during the matter-dominated epoch.",

        "The formation of the circumbinary envelope of Cygnus X-3 was studied byparticle simulations of the WR (Wolf Rayet) companion wind. Light curvesresulting from electron scattering absorption in this envelope were computedand compared with observed IBIS/ISGRI and BATSE light curves. The matching wasrelatively good. For reasonable values of binary parameters (masses,inclination) and wind velocities, a stable envelope was formed during a fewbinary orbits. Assuming approximately 10^-6 solar mass/year for the rate of theWR-wind, the observed light curves and accretion luminosity can be re-produced(assuming Thomson scattering opacity in the ionized He-rich envelope). Theilluminated envelope can also model the CHANDRA-spectrum using thephotoionizing XSTAR-code.

        "We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor spin model with multiple metastablephases, the number and decay pathways of which are explicitly controlled by theparameters of the system. With this model we can construct, for example, asystem which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastablephases. We also construct systems in which different phases may nucleatecompetitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present ageneral method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleationrates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, whichpredicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when thenew phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rateof a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phasesaccessible from it.",

There still remains the task of working this into an axiomaticlogical structure, what should be the foundational status of the concepts ofmeasurement and probability.

Thus Quantum Mechanics can be given alogically unexceptionable axiomatisation.

It' s too profitable not to trade with them, but I ca n' t help but find it disturbing when they throw themselves on the ground and beg for their lives. I ca n' t even help them up; my hands, perfected by millions of years of evolution to be a hunter' s tool, are too strong for them. Even the lightest touch could crush the beautiful carapaces. My teeth - normal human teeth - could rend their bodies to pieces. My stomach acids could dissolve them slowly and painfully. My body, as weak as it is compared to an Earth predator' s - hell, even a bigger human' s - body, could kill them so easily. And the ships, high up in orbit, are armed with nukes.",
        "Was traveling with a small infant and needed a car seat. I booked everything online and called to confirm. When I got to the rental desk the price was $100 more for the ten days than the online price I was given. I was told it was a 25% deposit. When I dropped the car off it still cost me $100 more, so no 25% deposit. nThe car seat was not ready when I arrived and I was told she had gotten me a nice \"clean\" one. The car seat was disgusting:  full of crumbs and food leftovers and smelled horrible. I had to cut holes I a blanket to run the straps of the car seat through because it was so nasty. My word of advice:  don't ever rent a car seat! When I inquired about car seat installation I was told they are not aloud to install them due to liability reasons which wasn't a problem. When I asked for the installation instructions and they didn't have them that was a problem. She said she would send her manager out to instruct me but he was just as clueless as she is about the word \"clean\". nNext month I will be renting from any other company besides enterprise. There are about 4-5 to choose from at that location.",

        "The plethora of recent cosmologically relevant data has indicated that ouruniverse is very well fit by a standard Friedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker(FLRW) model, with $\\Omega_{M} \\approx 0.27$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} \\approx0.73$ -- or, more generally, by nearly flat FLRW models with parameters closeto these values. Additional independent cosmological information, particularlythe maximum of the angular-diameter (observer-area) distance and the redshiftat which it occurs, would improve and confirm these results, once sufficientprecise Supernovae Ia data in the range $1.5 < z < 1.8$ become available. Weobtain characteristic FLRW closed functional forms for $C = C(z)$ and$\\hat{M}_0 = \\hat{M}_0(z)$, the angular-diameter distance and the density persource counted, respectively, when $\\Lambda \\neq 0$, analogous to those we havefor $\\Lambda = 0$. More importantly, we verify that for flat FLRW models$z_{max}$ -- as is already known but rarely recognized -- the redshift of$C_{max}$, the maximum of the angular-diameter-distance, uniquely gives$\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$, the amount of vacuum energy in the universe, independentlyof $H_0$, the Hubble parameter. For non-flat models determination of both$z_{max}$ and $C_{max}$ gives both $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ and $\\Omega_M$, theamount of matter in the universe, as long as we know $H_0$ independently.Finally, determination of $C_{max}$ automatically gives a very simpleobservational criterion for whether or not the universe is flat -- presumingthat it is FLRW.",
        "Sunspot penumbrae show a fine structure in continuum intensity that displaysconsiderable dynamics. The magnetic field, in contrast, although also highlystructured, has appeared to be relatively static. Here we report the discoveryof inward moving magnetic enhancements in the penumbrae of two regular sunspotsbased on time series of SOHO/MDI magnetograms. Local enhancements of the LOScomponent of the magnetic field in the inner part of the penumbral region moveinward to the umbra-penumbra boundary with a radial speed of about 0.3 kms$^{-1}$. These local inward-moving enhancements of the LOS component of themagnetic fields appear to be relatively common.

The ALG combines a three dimensionallattice gas with particles interacting through a soft core potential andorientational degrees of freedom. From the competition between the directionalattractive forces and the soft core potential results two liquid phases, doublecriticality and density anomaly. We study the mobility of the molecules in thismodel by calculating the diffusion constant at a constant temperature, $D$. Weshow that $D$ has a maximum at a density $\\rho_{max}$ and a minimum at adensity $\\rho_{min}<\\rho_{max}$. Between these densities the diffusivitydiffers from the one expected for normal liquids.

        "The effect of fractal normal-phase clusters on vortex dynamics in apercolative superconductor is considered. The superconductor containspercolative superconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clustersof a normal phase, acting as pinning centers. A prototype of such a structureis YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Agsheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transitionof the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolationtransition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vorticesare free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractaldimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transportcurrent are obtained. It is revealed that a mixed state of the vortex glasstype is realized in the superconducting system involved. The current-voltagecharacteristics of superconductors containing fractal clusters are obtained andtheir features are studied.",

Just hours ago we had reached an unnamed planet in Andromeda, entering its thick cloudy atmosphere and shooting out into this place. It was barren. The clouds, perhaps miles thick, expanded in every direction. We could n' t see light from the nearby suns or stars. We wandered the skies, searching for signs of anything, really, and this creature, or whatever it is, emerged from the haze in the distance. It glowed red. It came closer, its massiveness apparent, and swung at our ship. It swung, over and over, tried to grasp, and ultimately failed. But it did n' t stop. Now it' s collapsed into the sand. I exit the ship and slowly remove my helmet. I walk towards the creature. I walk and walk. It gets bigger and bigger. The closer I get, the more I realize how far I actually am.

Either way, it would be a great specimen to bring back to a lab on Earth, or at least whatever part of it we can manage to ship. Something catches my eye. Looking beyond the giant, into the haze from where it came, there is an ominous darkness. The skies there are n' t quite the same as the skies everywhere else, and it draws closer.

        "We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study aging phenomena and the occurence ofspinglass phases in systems of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles underthe combined influence of dipolar interaction and anisotropy energy, fordifferent combinations of positional and orientational disorder. We find thatthe magnetic moments oriente themselves preferably parallel to their anisotropyaxes and changes of the total magnetization are solely achieved by 180 degreeflips of the magnetic moments, as in Ising systems. Since the dipolarinteraction favorizes the formation of antiparallel chain-like structures,antiparallel chain-like patterns are frozen in at low temperatures, leading toaging phenomena characteristic for spin-glasses. Contrary to the intuition,these aging effects are more pronounced in ordered than in disorderedstructures.",
        "There exist methods for determining effective conservative interactions incoarse grained particle based mesoscopic simulations. The resulting models canbe used to capture thermal equilibrium behavior, but in the model system westudy do not correctly represent transport properties. In this article wesuggest the use of force covariance to determine the full functional form ofdissipative and stochastic interactions. We show that a combination of theradial distribution function and a force covariance function can be used todetermine all interactions in dissipative particle dynamics. Furthermore we usethe method to test if the effective interactions in dissipative particledynamics (DPD) can be adjusted to produce a force covariance consistent with aprojection of a microscopic Lennard-Jones simulation. The results indicate thatthe DPD ansatz may not be consistent with the underlying microscopic dynamics.We discuss how this result relates to theoretical studies reported in theliterature.",

The people of Birmingham can enjoy it.\"Following the 10 weeks, the decorated owls, individually designed by professional and amateur artists, went on public display again at Millennium Point on Saturday and Sunday before the auction on Thursday evening.An app to accompany the project was downloaded over 13,000 times and people have scanned the owls with phones more than 323,000 times, organisers have said.Speaking at the auction, hospital director of fundraising Louise McCathie said: \"It's just been outstanding.

        "I was meeting a friend for a semi-business lunch, so I wasn't able to try any of their house brewed beers (they server Kaliber, but they don't have their own non-alcoholic beer). The back of their lunch menu is all booze - 11 different martinis and 4 different margaritas and a whole bunch more. Definitely a full bar here! nnI had read over the previous Yelpers before going, so I had one of their salads - the Goat Cheese and Hummus. It was a huge scoop of hummus (at least a cup, maybe more) with a dressing tossed salad on top of sliced flatbreads. Way too much food, the hummus was sharp and tasty with just enough garlic that it was delicious but not so much that I was worried about my breath heading back to the office. Maybe there could have been more goat cheese, but that's just me complaining because it was good! nnMy friend had some sort of cheese topped grilled chicken with fries. While it was good, I absolutely won the competition. ;-)nnA very pleasant experience. I'd have no problem going back here if I'm Uptown.",
        "For the last year or so the food has been slipping and become mediocre - including, this fall, the worst plate of spaghetti I've ever been served in a restaurant (by an employee who is no longer there), but our experience on Saturday pretty much finished our long relationship with Deli Roma. nnWe arrived around 4: 30 p. m. and there was no one else in the deli. A young man was seated behind the register and greeted us, but did not get up. We saw the specials board had an item which was a play on the Godfather, their signature Italian roast beef sandwich, and discussed whether we'd want to try it. During all this the gentleman behind the counter remained seated but appeared to be paying attention. nnWhen I said we were ready to order he got up, but when I ordered a Godfather he said that they were out of Italian beef. I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients. nnIf he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business. If they don't want our business, we won't give it to them any more.",
        "Now every time I go, the smell of the place takes me back (something between wood-fired kitchen and just.. . kitchen). nnThis is another relatively safe place I can go with my parents. Though their veggie options are scant, their veggie burger is made in-house, I can get their six cheese penne without bacon, and I've always enjoyed their pimento cheese dip. nnUnfortunately, I found little to eat for lunch yesterday. I was looking for something light, and save ordering a salad (sans meat, of course), there wasn't much else on the menu that appealed to me. I do love a good bowl of soup, but Harper's rarely has a veggie soup on tap, and yesterday was no different. I ordered the spinach quesadilla, hoping it would be more spinachy than cheesy and thinking it's hard to eff up a quesadilla. Right? nnWHAT a disappointment. The quesadilla was a total mess, stuffed to the brim with a slurpy cheese mixture. The filling was incredibly uneven - one triangle had cheese with just a hint of spinach, another was filled entirely with the spinach mixture (which I am 99% sure is just their spinach dip repurposed), and another had a surprising number of cold, mealy tomato cubes. nnPer the usual, my dad ordered a small cup of soup, and the server barely hid her disdain at our tiny order. The sneer was palpable. nnI think I'm done with Harper's for a while.",
        "The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation ofgrains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensationefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by thistension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dustformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the firsttime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation totheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sunstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, ontime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering bythe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smallergrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with thatderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating ofsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supportsthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be presentin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.",

        "A negotiator for the rebels at peace talks in Havana, Victoria Sandino, read out a statement saying they would no longer recruit anyone under 18.The Farc last year said it would stop recruiting children under 17 and discharge those under 15.The government had said that move did not go far enough.Human rights groups define any member of a force aged under 18 as a child soldier.Army sources estimate that close to half of Farc members have been recruited as minors. One of those was Martin (not his real name).When I spoke to him, he told me how it was a natural thing for him and his brothers to end up in the Farc, a group that was consistently present in the area where they lived.They started, he said, doing errands for the rebels. When he was 11 he became a full member.\"We joined because it was the only choice we had,\" he told me. He left when he was 16.\"The important thing was to regain my freedom, to be able to do whatever I wanted,\" he said.The Farc has in the past said that its youngest members were the offspring of guerrilla fighters or had joined the Farc after they had been orphaned.In its statement on Wednesday, the Farc said that minors joined the rebel group because they had been left \"unprotected\" by the state.The rebels also urged President Juan Manuel Santos to end compulsory military service.The two sides have been engaged in peace talks since November 2012 and have reached agreement on four out of five main issues on their agenda.In September, President Santos set a deadline of 26 March 2016 for a final agreement to be signed, although Farc negotiators have since cast doubts on the probability of meeting that deadline.More than 220,000 people have been killed in almost 52 years of armed conflict in Colombia and more than six million people have been internally displaced.",

        "2nd day since The Incident. After a long half-day of trudging through a thick and verdant rainforest, the familiar patch of black, then some light reflected from metal, drew us to a car which had been laying around since at least the Incident. The rotation of a key created a rumble, and the car was off. Some meddling with the stick put us in reverse and a turn of the wheel to the right, more stick meddling, and a turn to the left set us off. Down the bumpy road for the rest of the day, before nightfall. Still in the rainforest, though judging from the map and what my partner had told me, we had made some quite good progress to the city. A scan of the car found some chocolates, a box of matches, a knife, some weird-looking string ( who knows what we would need it for? ), what they called a flashlight and batteries, some more clothes, a water container, and what looked like medicine. A blanket rolled up served as a sleeping bed for then.",
        "Annealed importance sampling is a means to assign equilibrium weights to anonequilibrium sample that was generated by a simulated annealing protocol. Theweights may then be used to calculate equilibrium averages, and also serve asan ``adiabatic signature'' of the chosen cooling schedule. In this paper wedemonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing thatequilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. Forthis system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficientthan constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth consideringwhenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at thebeginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), asit is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense.Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.",
        "We experimentally investigate the temperature dependence of Rabi oscillationsand Ramsey fringes in superconducting phase qubits driven by microwave pulses.In a wide range of temperatures, we find that both the decay time and theamplitude of these coherent oscillations remain nearly unaffected by thermalfluctuations. The oscillations are observed well above the crossovertemperature from thermally activated escape to quantum tunneling for undrivenqubits. In the two-level limit, coherent qubit response rapidly vanishes assoon as the energy of thermal fluctuations kT becomes larger than the energylevel spacing of the qubit. Our observations shed new light on the origin ofdecoherence in superconducting qubits. The experimental data suggest that,without degrading already achieved coherence times, phase qubits can beoperated at temperatures much higher than those reported till now.",
        "We consider a holographic model of QCD from string theory, a la Sakai andSugimoto, and study baryons. In this model, mesons are collectively realized asa five-dimensional \\$U(N_F)=U(1)\\times SU(N_F)$ Yang-Mills field and baryonsare classically identified as $SU(N_F)$ solitons with a unit Pontryagin numberand $N_c$ electric charges. The soliton is shown to be very small in the large't Hooft coupling limit, allowing us to introduce an effective field ${\\calB}$. Its coupling to the mesons are dictated by the soliton structure, andconsists of a direct magnetic coupling to the $SU(N_F)$ field strength as wellas a minimal coupling to the $U(N_F)$ gauge field. Upon the dimensionalreduction, this effective action reproduces all interaction terms betweennucleons and an infinite tower of mesons in a manner consistent with the large$N_c$ expansion. We further find that all electromagnetic interactions, asinferred from the same effective action via a holographic prescription, aremediated by an infinite tower of vector mesons, rendering the baryonelectromagnetic form factors completely vector-dominated as well. We estimatenucleon-meson couplings and also the anomalous magnetic moments, which comparewell with nature.",

Ever since I could remember I had this useless ability to feel pain before I was hurt about 5 minutes in advance. But I was at my home now with nothing out of the ordinary happening. The pain must have been visible because my son, Jason, asked, \" Daddy? What wong? \" He was only two and three months old, and still had trouble saying the' r' sound.

        "This paper aims to provide a practical example on the assessment andpropagation of input uncertainty for option pricing when using tree-basedmethods. Input uncertainty is propagated into output uncertainty, reflectingthat option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Optionpricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how closethe model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use,and those inputs are usually not observable. We provide three alternativeframeworks to calibrate option pricing tree models, propagating parameteruncertainty into the resulting option prices. We finally compare our methodswith classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no optionsmarket established. These methods can be applied to pricing of instruments forwhich there is not an options market, as well as a methodological tool toaccount for parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.",

This fact has complexconsequences on data analysis algorithms that motivate modifications of them.In fact most of the traditional data analysis tools for regression,classification and clustering have been adapted to functional inputs under thegeneral name of functional Data Analysis (FDA). In this paper, we investigatethe use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for functional data analysis and wefocus on the problem of curves discrimination. SVMs are large margin classifiertools based on implicit non linear mappings of the considered data into highdimensional spaces thanks to kernels. We show how to define simple kernels thattake into account the unctional nature of the data and lead to consistentclassification.

        "Recently the PVLAS collaboration reported the observation of a rotation oflinearly polarized laser light induced by a transverse magnetic field -- asignal being unexpected within standard QED.

We discuss a class of models, involving, in addition to our familiar``visible'' photon, further light ``hidden paraphotons'', which mixkinematically with the visible one, and further light paracharged particles. Inthese models, very strong astrophysical and cosmological bounds on the weaklyinteracting light particles mentioned above can be evaded. In the upcomingyear, a number of decisive laboratory based tests of the particleinterpretation of the PVLAS anomaly will be done.

I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room. I replied that equated to showing up at Firebird's at 7pm on a Saturday night and waiting for a table. The nurse agreed that I would probably be waiting another couple hours. That was unacceptable. They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so.

The model accounts for mechanical motion of the microcantilever andspatio-temporal variations (plasma effects) of the two-dimensional electrongas(2DEG) system in the transistor channel. The microcantilever mechanicalmotion is described in the point-mass approximation. The hydrodynamic electrontransport model is used to describe distributed electron plasma phenomena inthe 2DEG system. Using the developed model, we calculated the response functioncharacterizing the amplitude microcantilever oscillations and the outputelectric signal as functions of the signal frequency and the bias voltage forthe devices with different parameters. We find the voltage dependences of thefrequency of the mechanical resonance and its damping. In particular, it isdemonstrated that the amplitudes of the mechanical oscillations and outputelectric signal exhibit pronounced maxima at the bias voltages close to thevoltage of the 2DEG channel depletion followed by a steep drop with furtherincrease in the bias voltage.",

        "The problem of finding the asymptotic behavior of the maximal density ofsphere packings in high Euclidean dimensions is one of the most fascinating andchallenging problems in discrete geometry. One century ago, Minkowski obtaineda rigorous lower bound that is controlled asymptotically by $1/2^d$, where $d$is the Euclidean space dimension. An indication of the difficulty of theproblem can be garnered from the fact that exponential improvement ofMinkowski's bound has proved to be elusive, even though existing upper boundssuggest that such improvement should be possible. Using astatistical-mechanical procedure to optimize the density associated with a\"test\" pair correlation function and a conjecture concerning the existence ofdisordered sphere packings [S. Torquato and F. H. Stillinger, ExperimentalMath. {\\bf 15}, 307 (2006)], the putative exponential improvement was foundwith an asymptotic behavior controlled by $1/2^{(0.77865...)d}$. Using the samemethods, we investigate whether this exponential improvement can be furtherimproved by exploring other test pair correlation functions correponding todisordered packings. We demonstrate that there are simpler test functions thatlead to the same asymptotic result. More importantly, we show that there is awide class of test functions that lead to precisely the same exponentialimprovement and therefore the asymptotic form $1/2^{(0.77865...)d}$ is muchmore general than previously surmised.",

        "We determine the contribution of stars in galaxies, intracluster stars, andthe intracluster medium to the total baryon budget in nearby galaxy clustersand groups. We find that the baryon mass fraction (f_b) within r500 is constantfor systems with M500 between 6e13 and 1e15 Msun. Although f_b is lower thanthe WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observationalsystematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that ispredicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence forundetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance withcluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion ofthe contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increasein X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted forby a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument thatthe behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by adecrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within justthe stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCGand ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICLcomponent, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficientlyin higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from oursample selection, which favored systems with central, giant ellipticalgalaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of lowmass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation ofintracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment. Within r500and r200, the BCG+ICL contributes on average 40% and 33% of the total stellarlight, respectively.",
        "It was time. We all took our places in the ritual circle underneath the starlit sky, while the old medicine lady chanted and sang in the middle. Each person eagerly awaited their transformation. As the moon reached its apex, slowly, everyone began to change. Skin grew hairier, teeth grew sharper, eyes grew wilder. Everyone began changing into the spirit animals they saw in their visions. Well, everyone except me, that is. As my friends changed into wolves, eagles, bears, snakes, they all saw that I retained my human form. A few laughed at me and mocked for being stuck in this pitiful existence. Some pitied me for not being able to experience the new freedom and strength that came with a new form. Others looked at me with revulsion, and considered me unworthy and unclean. One by one, as each one completed the transformation, they slipped into the night. The old lady shook her head at me and sighed, suggesting that perhaps I did n' t pray hard enough. Her eyes were filled with frustration and pity. Yes, I' ll try again next year; yes, I' ll bring a better offering; yes, I' ll pray more fervently; and all that stuff. I ca n' t say that I was too disappointed by my lack of transformation, though. I was n' t exactly distressed. I *am* a shapeshifter, after all.",

        "We study the growth of black holes and stellar population in spheroids athigh redshift using several (sub)mm-loud QSO samples. Applying the samecriteria established in an earlier work, we find that, similar to IR QSOs atlow redshift, the far-infrared emission of these (sub)mm-loud QSOs mainlyoriginates from dust heated by starbursts. By combining low-z IR QSOs andhigh-z (sub)mm-loud QSOs, we find a trend that the star formation rate($\\Mstardot$) increases with the accretion rate ($\\Mdot$). We compare thevalues of $\\Mstardot/\\Mdot$ for submm emitting galaxies (SMGs), far-infraredultraluminous/hyperluminous QSOs and typical QSOs, and construct a likelyevolution scenario for these objects. The (sub)mm-loud QSO transition phase hasboth high $\\Mdot$ and $\\Mstardot$ and hence is important for establishing thecorrelation between the masses of black holes and spheroids.",

        "We present the most successful infrared cloud monitor for a robotictelescope. This system was originally developed for the MAGNUM 2-m telescope,which has been achieving unmanned and automated monitoring observation ofactive galactic nuclei at Haleakala on the Hawaiian island of Maui since 2001.Using a thermal imager and two aspherical mirrors, it at once sees almost thewhole sky at a wavelength of $\\lambda\\sim 10\\mu{\\rm m}$. Its outdoor part isweather-proof and is totally maintenance-free. The images obtained every one ortwo minutes are analysed immediately into several ranks of weather condition,from which our automated observing system not only decides to open or close thedome, but also selects what types of observations should be done. The whole-skydata accumulated over four years show that 50$-$60 % of all nights arephotometric, and about 75 % are observable with respect to cloud condition atHaleakala. Many copies of this system are now used all over the world such asMauna Kea in Hawaii, Atacama in Chile, and Okayama and Kiso in Japan.",

A complete derivation of the model ishere presented. The important issue of the self-consistent initial conditionsis addressed by analyzing the initial charging transient due to the electronexpansion, in the approximation of immobile ions. A comparison among differentkinetic models for the expansion is presented, showing that the ergodic modelprovides a simplified description, which retains the essential information onthe electron distribution, in particular, the energy spectrum. Results arepresented for a wide range of initial conditions (determined from a singledimensionless parameter), in excellent agreement with calculations from theexact Vlasov-Poisson theory, thus providing a complete and detailedcharacterization of all the stages of the expansion.",

        "Let M be a symplectic-toric manifold of dimension at least four. This paperinvestigates the so called symplectic ball packing problem in the toralequivariant setting. We show that the set of toric symplectic ball packings ofM admits the structure of a convex polytope. Previous work of the first authorshows that up to equivalence, only CP^1 x CP^1 and CP^2 admit density onepackings when n=2 and only CP^n admits density one packings when n>2. Incontrast, we show that for a fixed n>=2 and each r in (0, 1), there areuncountably many inequivalent 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds with amaximal toric packing of density r. This result follows from a general analysisof how the densities of maximal packings change while varying a givensymplectic-toric manifold through a family of symplectic-toric manifolds thatare equivariantly diffeomorphic but not equivariantly symplectomorphic.",
        "We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Waydepends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnovermass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMFimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does notdepend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in theglobular cluster system.",

Prepare. * Six o' clock. Peter turned to his laptop and scoured the Internet. For a moment he felt the brief spark of relief when he couldn' t find a reference this message. And then the dam broke. People from Japan to Australia to Toronto were asking the same question. How? And what did it mean? Some people panicked. Some people sounded overjoyed. The more he read, the more Peter felt a sense of a calm. In ten hours, if this was real, he would be out of his body. It had taken the last six years for him to adjust to his new life. It had taken every second since June 14, 2008 to finally feel even the vaguest sense of ease with how he had to live day to day. But as he watched the message clutter his Twitter page, Peter felt overjoyed. He stared at the corner of the room where his shackles lay dormant. The guilt was one thing. The agony of thinking about the accident everyday was another. But the physical repercussions were just the manifestation of denial. But in ten hours he would be free from the stares. No longer would his family be able to shake their heads and make passive-aggressive comments. He would never have to walk down the stairs and see her cherubic face frozen in time living in the parade of frames against the wall. While the world screamed in terror behind him, Peter got out of bed. In ten hours he would be free. He gripped the edge of the bedside table and reached over for his leg. In ten hours he would be whole again. In ten hours he would run.",
        "On any normal day you seem to get by with the average slip here or two, which is always amended right away, but this really took the cake. nnGlass night- Monty Python goblet. Knew what kind of turn out they were going to have so we made it a point to get there 30mins early. Even with getting there this early, we literally only had one table in the back open. Packed house. nnOur waitress, Amanda, came over and took our order right away for the glasses. We had no reason to believe we wouldn't get them as it was roughly 6: 40 at this point. Right at 7, glasses were given out to a few tables around us. We sat. And sat. And sat. Finally she came out to tell us we wouldn't be getting ours due to the fact they had only received half the shipment. I'll circle back to this later. nnShe also said the manager would come out and speak with us and that we had a free beer on them. Well long story short the manager never came to speak with us and the free beer was only limited to house brews, so if you were trying to pick away at your UFO club with 100+ brews tasted already, that didn't sound like it was happening either. nnThe thing that REALLY aggravated me was that the manager, who I didn't know until she was pointed out last night, came around to 5 other tables in the back area and apologized for the mishap. Every table BUT ours! She walked back up front and never came back! nnThe entire experience was fairly upsetting for being an avid fan of this place. If what was told to us was true, Amanda did a good job of handling herself, I'm sure that night was a mess for any waitress. As far as management is concerned, yeah, I am still pretty pissed off. nnAnd as per the glasses, which is whatever really, when you know your frequent customers see them out on the shelves on Monday, I would use a better excuse than \"we didn't know we only had half the shipment\", that is just pretty lame. Not to mention who doesn't inventory when they initially receive items? ?",

        "We calculate the nuclear matrix elements of the neutrinoless double beta($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decays of $^{76}$Ge and $^{82}$Se for the light-neutrinoexchange mechanism. The nuclear wave functions are obtained by using realistictwo-body forces within the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phaseapproximation (pnQRPA). We include the effects that come from the finite sizeof a nucleon, from the higher-order terms of nucleonic weak currents, and fromthe nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations. Most importantly, we improve onthe presently available calculations by replacing the rudimentary Jastrowshort-range correlations by the more advanced unitary correlation operatormethod (UCOM). The UCOM corrected matrix elements turn out to be notably largerin magnitude than the Jastrow corrected ones. This has drastic consequences forthe detectability of $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay in the present and future doublebeta experiments.",
        "In the bootstrap percolation model, sites in an L by L square are initiallyinfected independently with probability p. At subsequent steps, a healthy sitebecomes infected if it has at least 2 infected neighbours. As(L,p)->(infinity,0), the probability that the entire square is eventuallyinfected is known to undergo a phase transition in the parameter p log L,occurring asymptotically at lambda = pi^2/18. We prove that the discrepancybetween the critical parameter and its limit lambda is at least Omega((logL)^(-1/2)). In contrast, the critical window has width only Theta((logL)^(-1)). For the so-called modified model, we prove rigorous explicit boundswhich imply for example that the relative discrepancy is at least 1% even whenL = 10^3000. Our results shed some light on the observed differences betweensimulations and rigorous asymptotics.",

        "In this paper, a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) degreedistributions, whose decoding threshold on the binary erasure channel (BEC)admits a simple closed form, is presented. These degree distributions are asubset of the check regular distributions (i.e. all the check nodes have thesame degree), and are referred to as $p$-positive distributions. It is givenproof that the threshold for a $p$-positive distribution is simply expressed by$[\\lambda'(0)\\rho'(1)]^{-1}$. Besides this closed form threshold expression,the $p$-positive distributions exhibit three additional properties. First, forgiven code rate, check degree and maximum variable degree, they are in somecases characterized by a threshold which is extremely close to that of the bestknown check regular distributions, under the same set of constraints. Second,the threshold optimization problem within the $p$-positive class can be solvedin some cases with analytic methods, without using any numerical optimizationtool. Third, these distributions can achieve the BEC capacity. The lastproperty is shown by proving that the well-known binomial degree distributionsbelong to the $p$-positive family.",
        "We have conducted an extensive wide-field imaging survey for Cepheidvariables in the Local Group irregular galaxy WLM. From data obtained on 101nights, we have discovered 60 Cepheids which include 14 of the 15 Cepheidvariables previously detected by Sandage and Carlson. Down to a period of 3days, our Cepheid survey in WLM should be practically complete. Importantly, wehave found for the first time a long-period Cepheid (P=54.2 days) in thisgalaxy, alleviating the puzzle that WLM with its many blue, massive stars doesnot contain Cepheids with periods longer than about 10 days. Our data definetight period-luminosity relations in V, I and the reddening-free Wesenheitmagnitude ${\\rm W}_{\\rm I}$ which are all extremely well fit by thecorresponding slopes of the LMC Cepheid PL relation, suggesting no change ofthe PL relation slope down to a Cepheid metal abundance of about -1.0 dex, inagreement with other recent studies.

The dog lets out a single miserable bark as its prey goes out of reach, before curling back up on the porch.

He' d somehow managed to get his head through the large hole and out a small one, whilst his foot was stuck through the other. A gunshot goes off, followed by swearing from the farmer. The nimble fox darts into the barn, through a gap in the wall it knows well. The garment snags a splinter of wood, barring the foxes entry. This didn' t go unnoticed from the farmer, who runs closer for a better shot. The little fox' s feet claw against the hard dirt as it struggles to push through. The faint sound of the gun reloading can be heard through the barn walls. The cloth gives way as another gunshot goes off. The fox skids into the safety of the dark barn.

Here we describe a simple and effectiveapproach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Ourapproach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression.On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural networkclassification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods usingGaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparableperformance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neuralnetworks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large trainingdatasets, and making rapid predictions.

Different regimes can be characterized by varying the impactparameter at fixed energy. In the regime where momentum transfers reach thestring scale, string effects appear subdominant to higher-loop gravitationalprocesses, approximated via the eikonal. At smaller impact parameters,\"diffractive\" or \"tidal\" string excitation leads to processes dominated byhighly excited strings. However, new evidence is presented that theseexcitation effects do not play a direct role in black hole formation, whichcorresponds to breakdown of gravitational perturbation theory and appears todominate at sufficiently small impact parameters.

        "\" Look at him, \" Death said, \" he' s so bashful! \" I was dead, yet alive somehow, and even that was n' t the weirdest thing happening. I was standing on a floor of an office building, from the looks of it, which seemed to stretch for forever in every direction. Surrounding me was a crowd entirely made up of people I thought dead, including my parents, who were all wearing those sparkly and colorful cone hats you see at kid' s birthday parties. And Death itself was next to me, handing me a nicely wrapped gift. \" Consider it a cubicle-warming gift! \" he said while dropping the black, square, and glittery box into my trembling hands. \" Where am I? \" I asked. \" Hell, \" Death replied, \" but do n' t let that worry you. Live in the now! It' s present time, silly, just open your gift! \" I ripped the wrapping paper, which was of impressive quality, gently so that it remained in one reusable piece, and held it in one hand and the object it was used to conceal in the other. \" Do you like it? \" Death said, taking the wrapping paper from my hand and handing it to a hot woman, who turned out to be one of his assistants ( her title was a good fit ). The object was a word-a-day calendar, except it could never run out. All it had was one word: \" Dead. \" The definition it used? \" No longer living. \" \" Uh-huh, \" I said while staring at my father. \" Thanks a lot, Death. \"",
        "Instead, a legally separate, electricity system operator will be established within National Grid, the government says.The new system operator will have distinct employees, directors and offices from other National Grid electricity subsidiary companies.National Grid welcomed the move.In a statement, the company said it was best placed to deliver the system operator role during a time when the energy landscape is changing rapidly.National Grid owns and operates key parts of Britain's energy infrastructure.It charges generators regulated prices to transport electricity across its power network.But it also balances supply and demand across the network.It's this system operator function that critics say should be separated out of the overall group.Last year, MPs on the Energy Select Committee called for the introduction of an independent system operator.They warned that despite efforts by National Grid and Ofgem to mitigate the potential for conflicts of interest between its dual roles, the issue appeared \"intractable and growing\".Attention has focused upon National Grid's role in developing interconnector cables to import power from abroad. Critics say that, as the system operator, National Grid could prioritise sourcing electricity via these cables rather than from other sources of generation.Pointing to the situation in the United States, the then chairman of the committee, Angus MacNeil, stated that: \"The Independent System Operator model has worked in the USA. It is time for it to be brought to these shores.\"But National Grid's chief executive, John Pettigrew, had argued against a break-up, saying that he was not convinced that creating a separate system operator would be beneficial to customers.The company had also warned of the potential disruption to the energy sector and the risks to security of supply that a break-up could bring.",
        "I visited on a weeknight, and enjoyed the darker, upscale ambiance. However, based on previous reviews, the food is hit or miss. My dinner there was a substantial miss for a pretty substantial price. nnI ordered the mixed green salad and it was nothing special -- the dressing was blah and it was just regular goat cheese -- no crust, no heat, etc. I ordered the NY Strip because the waiter said it was amazing, as did another member of my group. Side note: the service was phenomenal, no problems in that department. When it arrived, we both found the steak to be EXTREMELY tough. I know it's not a filet, but you're supposed to be able to get your knife through it without breaking a sweat. I didn't try my friend's steak, but he actually sent his back for being virtually inedible. He swapped out for a filet with blue cheese and was quite pleased that he did. Maybe I should have done the same.. .. I don't know, but if you have to send your food back in order to get a decent meal, it's a pretty bad sign, especially at an expensive establishment. In Blue's defense, I believe they were pretty upset about my friend's meal -- we basically got an entire desert tray for free. Those were luckily delicious, as they made up a substantial part of my otherwise sub-par meal. nnBottom line, I will not go here again except for cocktails, some appetizers, and some jazz. Or if someone else is picking up the tab.",

        "The distribution of galaxies in position and velocity around the centers ofgalaxy clusters encodes important information about cluster mass and structure.Using the maxBCG galaxy cluster catalog identified from imaging data obtainedin the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we study the BCG-galaxy velocity correlationfunction. By modeling its non-Gaussianity, we measure the mean and scatter invelocity dispersion at fixed richness. The mean velocity dispersion increasesfrom 202+/-10 km/s for small groups to more than 854+/-102 km/s for largeclusters. We show the scatter to be at most 40.5+/-3.5%, declining to14.9+/-9.4% in the richest bins. We test our methods in the C4 cluster catalog,a spectroscopic cluster catalog produced from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR2spectroscopic sample, and in mock galaxy catalogs constructed from N-bodysimulations. Our methods are robust, measuring the scatter to well withinone-sigma of the true value, and the mean to within 10%, in the mock catalogs.By convolving the scatter in velocity dispersion at fixed richness with theobserved richness space density function, we measure the velocity dispersionfunction of the maxBCG galaxy clusters. Although velocity dispersion andrichness do not form a true mass-observable relation, the relationship betweenvelocity dispersion and mass is theoretically well characterized and has lowscatter. Thus our results provide a key link between theory and observations upto the velocity bias between dark matter and galaxies.",
        "What is life when you can not die? Does it have any real meaning, any significance at all, when you are immortal? I saw everyone I loved and cared about die, only to have to start up a new life and have it all happen again with different people in a different era. Having experienced the loss of so many, knowing that i will not join them, I can not help but think the only thing that makes life worth living is death. It is inevitable for everyone but me. Immortality is more of a curse than a blessing. Humans were n' t meant to live forever, we are born, we live, and we die. We are happy. Not me. I have learnt the secret to immortality, never get close to anyone. Ever since I heard that the Doomsday Machine had been set off I have contemplated my existence. Can i even call it an existence when my life is so meaningless? The world will be destroyed, covered in a layer of impenetrable ash that will block out the sun. Almost all plant life will die, the air will be so thick with toxic smog that people wo n' t be able to step out of their bunkers. Some might survive the initial explosions, but they will soon be dead. Everybody but me. Maybe my secret will get out, by that time it wo n' t matter. Everyone will be dead. No one will be there to see me. No one will care because no one will be alive except me. No one will be there to share the loneliness of my immortality. I will have the longest life of all, but what is life without death?",
        "In several classes of particle physics models -- ranging from the classicalMajoron models, to the more recent scenarios of late neutrino masses orMass-Varying Neutrinos -- one or more of the neutrinos are postulated to coupleto a new light scalar field. As a result of this coupling, neutrinos in theearly universe instead of streaming freely could form a self-coupled fluid,with potentially observable signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background andthe large scale structure of the universe. We re-examine the constraints onthis scenario from the presently available cosmological data and investigatethe sensitivity expected from the Planck satellite. In the first case, we findthat the sensitivity strongly depends on which piece of data is used. The SDSSMain sample data, combined with WMAP and other data, disfavors the scenario ofthree coupled neutrinos at about the 3.5$\\sigma$ confidence level, but alsofavors a high number of freely streaming neutrinos, with the best fit at 5.2.If the matter power spectrum is instead taken from the SDSS Large Red Galaxysample, best fit point has 2.5 freely streaming neutrinos, but the scenariowith three coupled neutrinos becomes allowed at $2\\sigma$. In contrast, Planckalone will exclude even a single self-coupled neutrino at the $4.2\\sigma$confidence level, and will determine the total radiation at CMB epoch to$\\Delta N_\\nu^{eff} = ^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ ($1\\sigma$ errors). We investigate therobustness of this result with respect to the details of Planck's detector.This sensitivity to neutrino free-streaming implies that Planck will be capableof probing a large region of the Mass-Varying Neutrino parameter space. Planckmay also be sensitive to a scale of neutrino mass generation as high as 1 TeV.",

        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency.It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type.Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups.The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death.It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen.Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT.B negative blood was useful as it could be used for both B negative and B positive patients, the organisation said.Donna Batty, donor relations manager at the NHSBT, asked donors to come forward in the \"next few days\".She said stocks of \"these vulnerable groups\" were \"lower than we would like\".Ms Batty added: \"We are also asking donors of those blood groups who have an appointment coming up to keep it.\"We hope our fantastic donors respond to this appeal and that they bear with us if there are slightly longer waits than normal on session as a result.\"In total, 4% of the UK's population currently donate blood.Jon Latham is assistant director of marketing of NHSBT said that ideally they wanted \"first-time donors\" to come forward.He said: \"The bigger the database we have for people willing to donate, the easier it us for us to call upon them at times of the year when when we have a need for a particular group.\"People unsure of their blood type could find out after donating, said the NHSBT.Those interested in donating are asked to call NHSBT on 0300 123 23 23.",
        "We propose a pairing-based method for cooling an atomic Fermi gas. A threecomponent (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where thecomponents 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by anelectromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired andin the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normalstate even when initially $T_{paired}\\geq T_{normal}$ (notation $T_S\\geq T_N$).The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth ofthe coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or otherphenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. Inprinciple, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires$T_N<T_S$. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based onsuperconductor -- normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arisefrom the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter couplingvs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process.Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirementin the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is nowplayed by the linewidth of the field. The proposed method should beexperimentally feasible due to its close connection to RF-spectroscopy ofultracold gases which is already in use.",
        "We present follow-up observations of pulsating subdwarf B (sdB) stars as partof our efforts to resolve the pulsation spectra for use in asteroseismologicalanalyses. This paper reports on multisite campaigns of the pulsating sdB starsPG 1618+563B and PG 0048+091. Data were obtained from observatories placedaround the globe for coverage from all longitudes. For PG 1618+563B, ourfive-site campaign uncovered a dichotomy of pulsation states: Early during thecampaign the amplitudes and phases (and perhaps frequencies) were quitevariable while data obtained late in the campaign were able to fully resolvefive stable pulsation frequencies. For PG 0048+091, our five-site campaignuncovered a plethora of frequencies with short pulsation lifetimes. We findthem to have observed properties consistent with stochastically excitedoscillations, an unexpected result for subdwarf B stars. We discuss ourfindings and their impact on subdwarf B asteroseismology.",
        "nnAND YOU DO KNOW you like those McDonalds fries, right? RIGHT? So don't y'all get all hoity toighty on me. nnThe place is owned by THE SWEETEST couple, and if you introduce yourself to them (ok, they're my neighbours) they'll always remember you, and treat you like family. nnFor me, I love their sushi, but I do have to disclose that I'm a veggie head, so give me spicy veggie tempura (there's something about deep fried food.. . aah) and I'm in heaven. And a regular veggie roll is always good. But if you want something complicated like unagi whatever (Ok, I like saying Unagi 'cause it reminds me of that Ross episode with the \"forseeing danger\" whatever, and I laugh), then I am not the person to review this. I have heard that it's not the best (not bad, but not Ginza.. . ) nnI do have a slight issue with their cost, I find it's a wee bit high given their food. i.e. I pay $8 for a veggie roll, when everywhere else (Ginza, etc) it's no more than $5. But alas, that SVT is REALLY yummy, and given that I live less than a block away, well.. . its' a great place when I don't want to cook and want to just walk and get take out.. ..",

I understand that they are trying to be cute and witty by concealing the item descriptions within paragraph-long stories and forcing you to read them due to the completely nonsensical names they give to said items. I truly understand the concept behind this. But can I be the first to say.. . IT'S NOT CUTE! For the drink menu, fine. I'll admit to having a few laughs at their PG-13 drink encyclopedia. I'm not that cold-hearted. But when I'm hungry, the last thing I want to do is spend 20 minutes trying to decipher what my options are. nnClearly I have a vendetta against their obnoxious menu, but the real problem here is that the food is the definition of mediocre. I go here fairly often, so I've done a lot of hopping around their menu trying to build my go-to order. I still haven't figured it out, and it's at the point where if my friends want to grab food here, I'll make a point out of eating beforehand. Plus, oh WOW is this place overpriced! This was especially highlighted to me on a Sunday morning when our bill came to $42 for brunch. Not expensive, but the wheels started turning in my head.. . we just paid $42 for an appetizer, two entrees, and two bloodys, all of which were eh, passable. For exactly $6 more, we could have went down the street to Casbah and had TWO appetizers, two entrees, and two much stronger bloodys, all of much higher quality. nnThe reason I still come here though is the drinks. My favorite is the Happy Ending which involves pineapple juice, ginger, and cucumber. You really can't go wrong with anything though except for the Statutory Grape--if the name doesn't dissuade you enough, just heed my advice and don't order it. Unless of course, you want to have flashbacks to that time you attempted to robotrip on Dimetapp in middle school. Memories! nnIt's official, I am done with the food at Harris Grill.

        "Every year, the Martinez Feast is held in honor of Lady Martinez, who united The Land after the Great Fires ravaged it, ending the Old Era. The feast was the source of much joy. An immense wealth of food was splayed out by Government for all the people. Those who had money fasted in preparation. Those in poverty could be said to fast the entire year. But rich or poor, all ate well the day of the feast. The poor came out in droves carrying pots and pans and whatever they had that could hold drink and food. After they ate their fill, they would take as much back with them as they could. A family could come home with enough food for weeks, if done right. The wealthy came for the jubilation. The feast was accompanied by games and comedy. Most of the jokes were very high brow. The entertainment was for the upper class, the food for the poor. It was n' t particularly tasty either, so those who could afford three meals a day did n' t bother eating much. Showing up without a container was a way to flaunt your wealth. This year was the 100th anniversary of the feast. A generation had come and gone since the first feast. Almost two since the beginning of the New Era. In honor of its centenary, Government had announced a new tradition. They promised it would better The Land. They promised our lives would be improved. They said a lot things most people did n' t understand, so when they said families would now need to \" honor High Lady Martinez by volunteering a child into the service of Government \" in order to enter the feast, most simply agreed.

        "We present optical and near-infrared light curves of SN 2001el from 310 to445 days past maximum light, obtained with the Very Large Telescope. Thelate-time optical (UBVRI) light curves decay in a nearly linear fashion withdecay time scales of 1.43\\pm0.14, 1.43\\pm0.06, 1.48\\pm0.06, 1.45\\pm0.07, and1.03\\pm0.07 magnitudes (per hundred days) in the U, B, V, R and I bands,respectively. In contrast, in the near-infrared (JHKs) bands the time evolutionof the flux appears to be nearly constant at these epochs. We measure declinerates (per hundred days) of 0.19\\pm0.10 and 0.17\\pm0.11 magnitudes in the J andH bands, respectively. We construct a UVOIR light curve, and find that thelate-time luminosity has a decay time scale nearly consistent with completedepostion of positron kinetic energy. The late-time light curves of the normaltype Ia SN 2001el demonstrate the increased importance of the near-infraredcontribution. This was previously observed in the peculiar SN 2000cx, and theresults for SN 2001el thus ensure that the conclusions previously based on asingle peculiar event are applicable to normal type Ia supernovae. The measuredlate-time UVOIR decline rate suggests that a majority of the positrons aretrapped within the ejecta.

I noticed the beer sampler and thought I would give it a try. I asked the server if I could choose the beers and she said yes.

They were cold but did not taste fresh. Next I ordered the famous \"Lobster Roll\" which comes with fries and slaw. It took nearly 20 minutes for my food to arrive but looked good at first glance. The fries were plentiful and hot but greasy. The lobster roll was served in a large piece of bread that resembled two uncut pieces of Texas toast. It was buttered and grilled to give it a nice appearance. The lobster inside was a small amount, cold and tough. The slaw was reasonably good and cold. nnThe server came back and I ordered a pint of draft beer.

        "We present a Regge-plus-resonance (RPR) description of the p(e,e'K^+)Yprocesses (Y=\\Lambda,\\Sigma^0) in the resonance region. The backgroundcontributions to the RPR amplitude are constrained by the high-energy p(\\gamma,K^+)Y data. As a result, the number of free model parameters in the resonanceregion is considerably reduced compared to typical effective-Lagrangianapproaches. We compare a selection of RPR model variants, originallyconstructed to describe $KY$ photoproduction, with the world electroproductiondatabase. The electromagnetic form factors of the intermediate N^*s and$\\Delta^*s are computed in the Bonn constituent-quark model. With this input,we find a reasonable description of the p(e,e'K^+)Y data without adding orreadjusting any parameters. It is demonstrated that the electroproductionresponse functions are extremely useful for fine-tuning both the background andresonant contributions to the reaction dynamics.",

        "nnI have a DSLR that I got from my father - it had never been cleaned or adjusted. It had been having some trouble with the battery, so I took it to the only place in Pittsburgh (apparently) that will help with this. A dark-haired guy greeted me as I walked in and treated me like a total noob, and his demeanor made me feel like the dirt under his shoes. However, he did give me good information and service about my camera when prompted by another man in the shop (who I might assume is Bernie). nnThey told me they could send it to the manufacturer where they'd clean it for a couple hundred bucks, but instead they cleaned out the sensors and the lens right there at the counter and checked the contacts between the lens and the camera. The dark-haired guy showed me through a magnifying glass what I was looking at, and explained that some spots I saw in the viewfinder were inside the top of the camera and wouldn't appear on the pictures. The other guy (Bernie? ) explained to me some of the functions of the camera -- I knew these already, but it was nice to hear them explained and he showed me a few examples. They advised me to get a UV filter to protect my lens, which I knew was overpriced but I happily bought anyway to pay for their service. nnSo I think the kind of experience you get depends entirely on the person you run into. I can see how someone would be put off by the dark haired guy I ran into first, and how someone would absolutely love the service from the other guy. All in all I'm pleased with my encounter with this shop, but I probably won't buy anything from there considering how overpriced it was -- however, if something goes wrong or I need any service, I'll definitely go back.",

The second visit was a works lunch, I had planned Del Frisco's for an American steak house experience for overseas guests but it was closed so decided to try the Palm. Big mistake, lunch menu was poor and the dinner menu is very over priced, the place was empty (not suprised) and my NY strip and fries was the worst steak I've ever paid for.

        "This work examines the problem of sequential detection of a change in thedrift of a Brownian motion in the case of two-sided alternatives. Applicationsto real life situations in which two-sided changes can occur are discussed.Traditionally, 2-CUSUM stopping rules have been used for this problem due totheir asymptotically optimal character as the mean time between false alarmstends to $\\infty$. In particular, attention has focused on 2-CUSUM harmonicmean rules due to the simplicity in calculating their first moments. In thispaper, we derive closed-form expressions for the first moment of a general2-CUSUM stopping rule. We use these expressions to obtain explicit upper andlower bounds for it. Moreover, we derive an expression for the rate of changeof this first moment as one of the threshold parameters changes. Based on theseexpressions we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds to this rate of change.Using these expressions we are able to find the best 2-CUSUM stopping rule withrespect to the extended Lorden criterion. In fact, we demonstrate not only theexistence but also the uniqueness of the best 2-CUSUM stopping both in the caseof a symmetric change and in the case of a non-symmetric case. Furthermore, wediscuss the existence of a modification of the 2-CUSUM stopping rule that has astrictly better performance than its classical 2-CUSUM counterpart for smallvalues of the mean time between false alarms. We conclude with a discussion onthe open problem of strict optimality in the case of two-sided alternatives.",

        "We use new and published near-IR spectra, with synthetic spectra, to derivephysical properties of three of the latest-type T dwarfs. A new R~1700 spectrumof the T7.5 dwarf HD 3651B, with existing data, allows a detailed comparison tothe well-studied and very similar dwarf, Gl 570D. We find that HD 3651B hasboth higher gravity and metallicity than Gl 570D, with Teff=820-830K, log g=5.4-5.5, [m/H]= +0.2 and Kzz=10^4cm^2/s. Its age is 8-12 Gyr and its impliedmass is 60-70 M_Jup. We perform a similar analyis of the T8 and T7.5 dwarfs2MASS J09393548-2448279 and 2MASS J11145133-2618235 using published data,comparing them to the well-studied T8, 2MASS J04151954-0935066. We find thatthe two dwarfs have the same Teff as the reference dwarf, and similargravities, but lower metallicities. The parameters are Teff=725-775K and [m/H]=-0.3; log g=5.3-5.45 for 2MASS J09393548-2448279 and log g=5.0-5.3 for 2MASSJ11145133- 261823. The age and mass are ~10Gyr and 60M_Jup for 2MASSJ09393548-2448279, and ~5 Gyr and 40M_Jup for 2MASS J11145133-261823. A seriouslimitation is the incompleteness of the line lists of CH4 and NH3 at lambda<1.7um. Spectra of Saturn and Jupiter, and of laboratory CH4 and NH3 gas,suggest that NH3 features in the Y- and J-bands may be useful as indicators ofthe next cooler spectral type, and not features in the H- and K-bands aspreviously thought. However large uncertainties remain, as the abundance of NH3is likely to be significantly below the chemical equilibrium value, andinclusion of laboratory NH3 opacities predicts band shapes that are discrepantwith existing data. It is possible that the T spectral class will have to beextended to low temperatures around 400K, when water clouds condense in theatmosphere [abridged].",

No matter how many voyages I go on, that possibility never ceases to frighten me. This was it, though. The last voyage. Soon, I would n' t have to be scared anymore. As I made my way to the bridge, I encountered a control panel on the wall. Like double checking an alarm clock, I would always take a second look at it. Just to make sure. Yes, the ship was still in motion. Yes, the ship was still activated and no, there were no power failures. Good. I would check again in a few minutes.

My final job. As I reopened them, I took a look at the control panel sitting in front of me now. All engines were running. The ship was still activated. There were no power failures. Once again, I breathed a sigh of relief. If for even a second, our systems failed us, we would be instantly destroyed. We were even closer now, only a single mile away from the other ship. It was massive. Easily one of the largest I had ever seen. I steadied my gaze and looked directly at Sebastian. He met mine with equal enthusiasm. One more time. Just one more time.

A normal solution is obtained via aChapman--Enskog--like expansion around a local shear flow distribution f^{(0)}that retains all the hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate. The constitutiveequations for the heat and momentum fluxes are obtained to first order in thedeviations of the hydrodynamic field gradients from their values in thereference state and the corresponding generalized transport coefficients are{\\em exactly} determined in terms of the coefficient of restitution \\alpha andthe shear rate a. Since f^{(0)} applies for arbitrary values of the shear rateand is not restricted to weak dissipation, the transport coefficients turn outto be nonlinear functions of both parameters a and \\alpha.

It's also free for me as a Pitt employee. nnHowever, my main complaints arenn1. The buses are way too crowded during rush hour. Not only are the buses almost always so full that the standing room is occupied, but bus drivers some times even have to drive by peeved people at bus stations because the bus is completely full. n2. Irregular intervals. Buses have a tendency to bunch. This some times results in having to wait at a bus station for a long time before seeing two buses together. The lead bus is overcrowded and the second bus is usually pretty empty. Note:  Bus bunching is a well-known phenomenon. http: //en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Bus_bunchingn3. Waiting outside in the cold for the bus. Because of irregular intervals, you some times have to wait outside in Pittsburgh weather for significant time. nnPittsburgh needs to install GPS on their buses!

People could check online or on their smart phones when the next bus was about to arrive so they could wait in the comfort of their homes or offices, rather than cold Pittsburgh weather, and   n2. Bus drivers could adjust their driving speeds to avoid bunching.",

        "Synthetic bio-molecular spiders with \"legs\" made of single-stranded segmentsof DNA can move on a surface which is also covered by single-stranded segmentsof DNA complementary to the leg DNA. In experimental realizations, when a legdetaches from a segment of the surface for the first time it alters thatsegment, and legs subsequently bound to these altered segments more weakly.Inspired by these experiments we investigate spiders moving along aone-dimensional substrate, whose legs leave newly visited sites at a slowerrate than revisited sites. For a random walk (one-leg spider) the slowdown doesnot effect the long time behavior. For a bipedal spider, however, the slowdowngenerates an effective bias towards unvisited sites, and the spider behavessimilarly to the excited walk. Surprisingly, the slowing down of the spider atnew sites increases the diffusion coefficient and accelerates the growth of thenumber of visited sites.",
        "We study the elasticity of random stiff fiber networks. The elastic responseof the fibers is characterized by a central force stretching stiffness as wellas a bending stiffness that acts transverse to the fiber contour. Previousstudies have shown that this model displays an anomalous elastic regime wherethe stretching mode is fully frozen out and the elastic energy is completelydominated by the bending mode. We demonstrate by simulations and scalingarguments that, in contrast to the bending dominated \\emph{elastic energy}, theequally important \\emph{elastic forces} are to a large extent stretchingdominated. By characterizing these forces on microscopic, mesoscopic andmacroscopic scales we find two mechanisms of how forces are transmitted in thenetwork. While forces smaller than a threshold $F_c$ are effectively balancedby a homogeneous background medium, forces larger than $F_c$ are found to beheterogeneously distributed throughout the sample, giving rise to highlylocalized force-chains known from granular media.",

First, weanalyze the complexity of defeating the proposed protocols by quantifying theworkload of a human adversary. Secondly, we propose a new construction based ontextual CAPTCHAs (Reverse Turing Tests) in order to make the generation ofautomated challenges easier. We also present a brief experiment involving realhuman users to find out the number of possible attributes in a given image andgive some guidelines for the selection of challenge questions based on theresults. Finally, we analyze the previously proposed protocol in detail for therelationship between the secrets. Our results show that we can construct humanidentification protocols based on image evaluation with reasonably``quantified'' security guarantees based on our model.",

        "Experimental and theoretical studies are presented related to theground-state magneto-optical resonance prepared in Cesium vapour confined in anExtremely Thin Cell (ETC, with thickness equal to the wavelength of theirradiating light). It is shown that the utilization of the ETC allows one toexamine the formation of a magneto-optical resonance on the individualhyperfine transitions, thus distinguishing processes resulting in dark (reducedabsorption) or bright (enhanced absorption) resonance formation. We report onan experimental evidence of the bright magneto-optical resonance sign reversalin Cs atoms confined in the ETC. A theoretical model is proposed based on theoptical Bloch equations that involves the elastic interaction processes ofatoms in the ETC with its walls resulting in depolarization of the Cs excitedstate which is polarized by the exciting radiation. This depolarization leadsto the sign reversal of the bright resonance. Using the proposed model, themagneto-optical resonance amplitude and width as a function of laser power arecalculated and compared with the experimental ones. The numerical results arein good agreement with the experiment.",
        "Prochter et al. 2006 recently found that the number density of strongintervening 0.5<z<2 MgII absorbers detected in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglowspectra is nearly 4 times larger than in QSO spectra. We have conducted asimilar study using CIV absorbers. Our CIV sample, consisting of a total of 20systems, is drawn from 3 high resolution and high to moderate S/N VLT/UVESspectra of 3 long-duration GRB afterglows, covering the redshift interval 1.6<z<3.1. The column density distribution and number density of this sample do notshow any statistical difference with the same quantities measured in QSOspectra. We discuss several possibilities for the discrepancy between CIV andMgII absorbers and conclude that a higher dust extinction in the MgII QSOsamples studied up to now would give the most straightforward solution.However, this effect is only important for the strong MgII absorbers.Regardless of the reasons for this discrepancy, this result confirms once morethat GRBs can be used to detect a side of the universe that was unknown before,not necessarily connected with GRBs themselves, providing an alternative andfundamental investigative tool of the cosmic evolution of the universe.",

        "In the density functional (DF) theory of Kohn and Sham, the kinetic energy ofthe ground state of a system of noninteracting electrons in a general externalfield is calculated using a set of orbitals. Orbital free methods attempt tocalculate this directly from the electron density by approximating theuniversal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple localapproximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devisegenerally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kineticpotential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears inthe Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kineticpotential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivatedapproximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which thevalue of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose twononlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms forboth slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exactresults for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system tosmall perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurateand weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varyingvalence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital freeDF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these localpseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kineticpotentials. Our theory yields results for the total energies and ionizationenergies of atoms, and for the shell structure in the atomic radial densityprofiles that are in very good agreement with calculations using the fullKohn-Sham theory.",

        "The Bogoliubov recursion is a particular procedure appearing in the processof renormalization in perturbative quantum field theory.

We develop here a theory offunctional identities for noncommutative Rota-Baxter algebras which is shown toencode, among others, this process in the context of Connes-Kreimer's Hopfalgebra of renormalization. Our results generalize the seminal Cartier-Rotatheory of classical Spitzer-type identities for commutative Rota-Baxteralgebras. In the classical, commutative, case, these identities can beunderstood as deriving from the theory of symmetric functions. Here, we showthat an analogous property holds for noncommutative Rota-Baxter algebras. Thatis, we show that functional identities in the noncommutative setting can bederived from the theory of noncommutative symmetric functions.

        "We first present chemodynamical simulations to investigate how stellar windsof massive stars influence early dynamical and chemical evolution of formingglobular clusters (GCs). In our numerical models, GCs form inturbulent,high-density giant molecular clouds (GMCs), which are embedded in amassive dark matter halo at high redshifts. We show how high-density, compactstellar systems are formed from GMCs influenced both by physical processesassociated with star formation and by tidal fields of their host halos. We alsoshow that chemical pollution of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massivestars can result in star-to-star abundance inhomogeneities among light elements(e.g., C, N, and O) of stars in GCs. The present model with a canonical initialmass function (IMF) also shows a C-N anticorrelation that stars with smaller[C/Fe] have larger [N/Fe] in a GC. Although these results imply that``self-pollution'' of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massive stars cancause abundance inhomogeneities of GCs, the present models with differentparameters and canonical IMFs can not show N-rich stars with [N/Fe] ~ 0.8observed in some GCs (e.g., NGC 6752). We discuss this apparent failure in thecontext of massive star formation preceding low-mass one within GC-forming GMCs(``bimodal star formation scenario''). We also show that although almost allstars (~97%) show normal He abundances (Y) of ~0.24 some stars later formed inGMCs can have Y as high as ~0.3 in some models. The number fraction of He-richstars with Y >0.26 is however found to be small (~10^-3) for most models.",

From the minute you walk into the restaurant to the time you leave it's like they put these rose colored glasses on you and all you see is the awesome atmosphere, service, and food. nWe received 2 complimentary glasses of champagne, and prosciutto wrapped arracini to start us off. Lobster & Crab Cakes for sweetie and a tomato mozzarella salad for me. The tomatoes were cut thick and were complimented by sweet cherry tomatoes and a 12 year aged balsamic. All very well done. I admit that I did make a mistake. I wanted to save room for dessert, so I usually order the porcini rubbed delmonico, but I figured a bone in steak was a bit much. I ordered the 10 Oz Fillet instead and it was served with 2 large shrimp stuffed with lump crabmeat. The fillet was cooked nicely and the shrimp were prepared to my satisfaction, I just prefer a ribeye, so looking back I should order what I like and have the mindset to take home what I can't finish. Now, onto the side dishes.. . the Lobster Mac N Cheese is like heaven on a plate, I don't know or do I particularly care how much butter they add to it, but it is nothing short of spectacular. Creamed Spinach is also awesome. Cheesecake for dessert was like it came out of a magazine. I think someone told me that their Head Chef was a pastry chef in his past life which leads me to believe that their cheesecake at this location is better than most. nThe service at the Capital Grille is top notch. They take such good care of you and make you feel like you're the only customer. I will continue to go back for this reason and encourage everyone to do the same. nnSee you soon Guys!",
        "We present the stellar calibrator sample and the conversion from instrumentalto physical units for the 24 micron channel of the Multiband Imaging Photometerfor Spitzer (MIPS). The primary calibrators are A stars, and the calibrationfactor based on those stars is 4.54*10^{-2} MJy sr^{-1} (DN/s)^{-1}, with anominal uncertainty of 2%. We discuss the data-reduction procedures required toattain this accuracy; without these procdures, the calibration factor obtainedusing the automated pipeline at the Spitzer Science Center is 1.6% +/- 0.6%lower. We extend this work to predict 24 micron flux densities for a sample of238 stars which covers a larger range of flux densities and spectral types. Wepresent a total of 348 measurements of 141 stars at 24 micron. This samplecovers a factor of ~460 in 24 micron flux density, from 8.6 mJy up to 4.0 Jy.We show that the calibration is linear over that range with respect to targetflux and background level. The calibration is based on observations made using3-second exposures; a preliminary analysis shows that the calibration factormay be 1% and 2% lower for 10- and 30-second exposures, respectively. We alsodemonstrate that the calibration is very stable: over the course of themission, repeated measurements of our routine calibrator, HD 159330, show aroot-mean-square scatter of only 0.4%. Finally, we show that the point spreadfunction (PSF) is well measured and allows us to calibrate extended sourcesaccurately; Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) and MIPS measurements of asample of nearby galaxies are identical within the uncertainties.",

        "After spending time with a salesman I was told that the deal I was trying to get was impossible. Because I would not allow them to run my credit to run general numbers, I was told by the salesman I was making his job difficult. I have purchased dozens of cars over the years and have never given my social before all the numbers were given. The salesman told me either I let them run my social or they wouldn't do business. At no time did a manager come over and help out. I basically was told either I do it their way or I needed to walk. He told me to leave and that there is no way I could get the deal I wanted. Needless to say I purchased the same vehicle from Keith Hawthorne Ford a couple hours later for less than what I was trying to buy the car for at Town and Country. Some could say that the dealership does not deserve a bad review based on this rather, the salesman didn't do their job. I thought this at first, I just have been asking myself why wouldn't the manager come over and try to stop me from leaving or help work on the deal. Specially, as it was obvious they had a newer salesman.",

The crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and I had to switch meals. The crab cakes taste like fried mayo.. . I couldn't even taste the crab! The fish and chips looked great but it didn't taste like anything! No seasoning at all! The waitress was so bad that when it came time to give us our check, she was no where to be found. It took 15 minutes to actually get the check (keep in mind we already finished eating).. . thank God we had cash! A complete waste of $40.

        "The anisotropy in the angular distribution of the fusion-fission andquasifission fragments for the $^{16}$O+$^{238}$U, $^{19}$F+$^{208}$Pb and$^{32}$S+$^{208}$Pb reactions is studied by analyzing the angular momentumdistributions of the dinuclear system and compound nucleus which are formedafter capture and complete fusion, respectively. The orientation angles ofaxial symmetry axes of colliding nuclei to the beam direction are taken intoaccount for the calculation of the variance of the projection of the total spinonto the fission axis. It is shown that the deviation of the experimentalangular anisotropy from the statistical model picture is connected with thecontribution of the quasifission fragments which is dominant in the$^{32}$S+$^{208}$Pb reaction. Enhancement of anisotropy at low energies in the$^{16}$O+$^{238}$U reaction is connected with quasifission of the dinuclearsystem having low temperature and effective moment of inertia.",

        "Recent studies of the near-infrared (NIR) properties of dwarf irregulargalaxies (dIs) and blue compact dwarfs (BCDs) have provided improved estimatesfor the NIR luminosity of old stellar populations in these galaxies. These canbe used to derive gas fractions, and thereby to evaluate how BCDs have evolvedwith respect to dIs. Oxygen abundances have been derived for four BCDs in theVirgo Cluster from a run at Gemini-North in 2003. Combining these newabundances with published values, we study the correlations among themetallicity, Ks luminosity, gas mass, baryonic mass, and gas fraction. Withinerrors, the two types of dwarfs appear to share a common relation between theoxygen abundance and the luminosity in Ks. The correlation between metallicityand the gas fraction is the same for BCDs as for dIs, indicating that BCDevolution has been similar to dIs. Since dIs appear to have evolved as isolatedsystems, the BCD bursts are unlikely to be a consequence of gas infall ormerging.",

        "The chemical analysis of secondary stars of low mass X-ray binaries providesan opportunity to study the formation processes of compact objects, eitherblack holes or neutron stars. Following the discovery of overabundances of$\\alpha$-elements in the HIRES/Keck spectrum of the secondary star of NovaScorpii 1994 (Israelian et al. 1999), we obtained UVES/VLT high-resolutionspectroscopy with the aim of performing a detailed abundance analysis of thissecondary star. Using a $\\chi2$-minimization procedure and a grid of syntheticspectra, we derive the stellar parameters and atmospheric abundances of O, Mg,Al, Ca, Ti, Fe and Ni, using a new UVES spectrum and the HIRES spectrum.Theabundances of Al, Ca, Ti, Fe and Ni seem to be consistent with solar values,whereas Na, and especially O, Mg, Si and S are significantly enhanced incomparison with Galactic trends of these elements. A comparison withspherically and non-spherically symmetric supernova explosion models mayprovide stringent constraints to the model parameters as mass-cut and theexplosion energy, in particular from the relative abundances of Si, S, Ca, Ti,Fe and Ni. Most probably the black hole in this system formed in a hypernovaexplosion of a 30--35 \\Msun progenitor star with a mass-cut in the range 2--3.5\\Msun. However, these models produce abundances of Al and Na almost ten timeshigher than the observed values.",

As we usually do, we decided to share our entrees (TIP - you can get half portion sizes of the pastas!! ) and augment the meal with a few appetizers. For the appetizers, we got the chickpea flatbread, the arugula salad and the sea scallops. The flatbread and salad were just OK. The sea scallops would have been delicious except for the \"cured egg yolk\" which was infused in the avacado sauce. For those who have never tried a cured egg yolk, I would consider yourself lucky. Actually, the taste wasn't too bad. The smell, however, reminded me of what you would smell if you were on the set of a nasty version of a Hoarders TV episode.

        "aims: Our aim is to determine Li abundances in TO stars of the GlobularCluster 47 Tuc and test theories about Li variations among TO stars. method: Wemake use of high resolution (R~ 43000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N=50--70)spectra of 4 turn off (TO) stars obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the8.2m VLT Kueyen telescope. results: The four stars observed, span the range1.6<~A(Li)} <~ 2.14, providing a mean A(Li) = 1.84 with a standard deviation of0.25 dex. When coupled with data of other two TO stars of the cluster,available in the literature, the full range in Li abundances observed in thiscluster is 1.6<~A(Li)<~ 2.3. The variation in A(Li) is at least 0.6 dex (0.7dex considering also the data available in the literature) and the scatter issix times larger than what expected from the observational error. We claim thatthese variations are real. A(Li) seems to be anti-correlated with A(Na) exactlyas observed in NGC 6752. No systematic error in our analysis could produce suchan anti-correlation. conclusions: Na production through p captures on 22Ne attemperatures in excess of 3x10^7 K and the contemporary Li destruction couldresult in this anti-correlation. However such nuclear processing cannot havetaken place in the stars themselves, which do not reach such high temperatures,even at their centre. This points towards the processing in a previousgeneration of stars. The low N/O ratios in the observed stars and the apparentlack of correlation between N an Li abundances, place a strong constraint onthe properties of this previous generation. Our results indicate a differentbehaviour among the Globular Clusters so far studied as far as the abundancepatterns are concerned.",
        "Gregory was at first reluctant to take the job initially. He was a squire for his knight Sir Rodrick and would have rather been polishing his lieges armor or cleaning his sword rather than hunting down dinner but when the paige came looking for the knight and found him' indisposed' decisions had to be made. The paige explained the problem. As it turned out the castle mage had been playing around with enchantment spells, supposedly to try and make food alcoholic. Why he didnt simply stew the goose in whiskey was beyond Gregs imagination but the damage had been done. Running loose inside the castle was an abnormally large goose that smelled strongly of beer and hops. Sir Rodrick was the only knight in the castle at this time and the guards refused to fight the goose, it both terrified them and left them immobile from lack of breath. It seemed every-time they engaged it they would begin burst out in laughter as one of them was singled out to be chased. To make matters worse the goose had now entered the living area of the royals quarters and cornered the princess in her room. Evidently she had been enjoying a nice roast duck and the goose caught wind of it. The order had been given, the payment promised was the goose and a few gold coins. Greg did not need either of these things however, he had a strong dislike for the princess and would love nothing more then to see the terror in her eyes as a drunk goose kept her hostage in her room. There were no ballads to sing praises for Gregs bravery though no man had faced a foe of such odor and ferocity. The battle was quick and his joy sublime as he found that roasted, the goose fat was whiskey and its meat like beer.",
        "I walked alone down the street. Sure, there were people all around me, hundreds, thousands, but I was alone. Retreated deep into my mind away from the horrors of humanity. None of them realised what they were doing, how they were hurting each other, hurting themselves. The conflict that was at the heart of our city raged on inside everyone, while nobody acknowledged it was happening. People were dying and nobody thought it was an atrocity. People were starving and nobody thought to feed them. I was the only one who saw, the only one who realised what was happening. But what could one person do in twenty thousand? This conflict had no leaders, no central tenet, it was a centuries-old hatred between two peoples, but there was no opportunity for fighting because of those alien oppressors who kept us together. You' d think we' d be united against them, but instead we blamed each other. I blamed everyone, and I had to leave. I kept walking, along the main road towards the barricades and guard posts.

        "We re-analyze the direct $\\jp$ production processes at the Fermilab Tevatronin view of the recent observation at the B-factories, where both $\\jp$inclusive and exclusive production rates are found to be about an order ofmagnitude larger than the leading order estimates of non-relativistic QCD. Thecharm quark fragmentation to $\\jp$, which is the dominant color-singlet processat high $p_T$, is normalized by the B-factory measurements. The processreceives further enhancement due to the charm sea contribution which has so farbeen ignored in most analyses. After summing up all sub-process contributions,we find that the color-singlet mechanism alone can account for 20% to 90% ofthe observed direct $\\jp$ high $p_T$ production. The polarization rate of thedirectly produced $\\jp$ is sensitive to the fraction of the color-octetcontribution, which is employed to fill the gap between the color-singletprediction and experimental data. With a bigger $K$-factor for the charm quarkfragmentation probability, we envisage a smaller matrix element for thecolor-octet $^3S_1^{(8)}$ state, and this can be examined at the LHC in nearfuture.",

        "Measurable spectra are theoretically very often derived from complicatedmany-body Green's functions. In this way, one calculates much more informationthan actually needed. Here we present an in principle exact approach toconstruct effective potentials and kernels for the direct calculation ofelectronic spectra. In particular, the potential that yields the spectralfunction needed to describe photoemission turns out to be dynamical but {\\itlocal} and {\\it real}. As example we illustrate this ``photoemissionpotential'' for sodium and aluminium, modelled as homogeneous electron gas, anddiscuss in particular its frequency dependence stemming from the nonlocality ofthe corresponding self-energy. We also show that our approach leads to a veryshort derivation of a kernel that is known to well describe absorption andenergy-loss spectra of a wide range of materials.",

        "The 17-year-old fell some 40m (130ft) into a dry riverbed below. The teenager had been in a group from the Netherlands and Belgium staying at a nearby surf camp.Last month, British tourist Kleyo De Abreu died in a bungee jump off a bridge near Granada, southern Spain.She suffered fatal injuries when she hit the wall of the bridge below her.A police spokesman told Dutch media that the latest \"ghastly accident\" may have been caused by carelessness, although it was unclear what had gone wrong.The teenager had been taking part in a type of bungee jump known as \"puenting\", which involves diving with two cords attached, and then swinging beneath the bridge or viaduct.Bungee jumping has become extremely popular in Spain in recent years, both among locals and foreign tourists.Spectacular settings in rural areas of Andalusia in the south, or Cantabria and the Pyrenees in the north are common destinations both for bungee aficionados and first-timers.Companies offer both bungee jumping and its bridge-swinging variant, \"puenting\".There have been around 10 deaths linked to bungee jumping since it took off in the 1980s. Prior to the two fatalities this summer, the most recent was that of a 48-year-old man at Robledo de Chavela, near Madrid, in 2013.How to check your jump is safeLocal police chief Joaquin Gonzalez said he had not known that puenting took place on the bridge, adding that it was \"extremely risky\".The jump took place from the top of a bridge over the A8 road at Cabezon de la Sal in Cantabria.Mayor Isabel Fernandez told Dutch TV that it was an enormous tragedy. \"The girl was so young.

Skype was an Estonian company but founded and rooted firmly in London, and when Microsoft swooped it was assumed that this would continue to be where its future was shaped.Now it's facing strong headwinds, failing to establish itself as the prime means of business communications, and Microsoft is cutting costs.If the firm was still controlled from London, the axe might have fallen elsewhere - but with key decisions being made far away in Seattle, there was no room for sentiment about Skype's history.Foreign buyers always make positive noises about  boosting jobs and investment - but sometimes those promises are hard to keep.Read more: Has the UK got Tech Talent?",

Spicy items were designated as such. nnMy lunch, Hot and Sour Soup and Garlic Shrimp arrived (temperature) hot, well-presented and adequately seasoned. Neither dish was particularly fresh or inspiring, however. nnMy thought: if you need a place to go that's consistent, Baoding is a good choice. If you're a food adventurer seeking authentic Chinese food, go elsewhere. I would not characterize Baoding as a good Chinese restaurant, but I will say it is a good Chinese-American restaurant.",
        "We revisit the problem of interplay between the strong and the Coulombinteraction in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio for $B {\\bar B}$ and $D {\\barD}$ pairs near their respective thresholds in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. Weconsider here a realistic situation with a resonant interaction in the isospinI=0 channel and a nonresonant strong scattering amplitude in the I=1 state. Wefind that the yield ratio has a smooth behavior depending on the scatteringphase in the I=1 channel. The same approach is also applicable to the $K {\\barK}$ production at the $\\phi(1020)$ resonance, where the Coulomb effect in thecharged-to-neutral yield ratio is generally sensitive to the scattering phasesin both the isoscalar and the isovector channels. Furthermore, we apply thesame approach to the treatment of the effect of the isotopic mass differencebetween the charged and neutral mesons and argue that the strong-scatteringeffects generally result in a modification to the pure kinematical effect ofthis mass difference.",
        "The extraction of the weak phase $\\alpha$ from $B\\to\\pi\\pi$ decays has beencontroversial from a statistical point of view, as the frequentist vs. bayesianconfrontation shows. We analyse several relevant questions which have notdeserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\\alpha$.Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. Weshow that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless orinadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: thesingle weak phase $\\alpha$ just in the $\\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospinrelations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\\alpha$through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is norelevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results.

        "The officers were convicted of killing 13 inmates in the city's Carandiru jail during an operation to end a revolt.In all, 111 prisoners died, and prosecutors argued that most of them were shot dead at close range.The officers' lawyers said they would appeal. Three other policemen were acquitted during the trial.The 23 convicted officers - most of whom are now retired - had originally been accused of killing 15 inmates, but two of the victims were later thought to have been killed by fellow prisoners.Dozens more officers are expected to be brought to trial in connection with the case in the coming months.In 2001, Col Ubiratan Guimaraes, who led the police operation to regain control in Carandiru, was convicted of using excessive force. But he was acquitted on appeal in 2006.'Self-defence'The riot began on 2 October 1992 after an argument between two inmates quickly spread, with rival gangs facing off in what was at the time one of South America's largest prisons, housing 10,000 inmates.Inmates said riot police brutally repressed the riot.\"We never thought they would come in and kill people randomly, as not everyone had joined the rebellion,\" former prisoner Jacy de Oliveira told BBC Brasil's Luis Kawaguti.\"The policemen began shooting everyone; I was on the fifth floor, if you looked a policeman in the eyes, you were dead,\" he said.The officers' lawyer, Ieda Ribeiro de Souza, argued they were only doing their duty and acted in self-defence, as many of the inmates were armed.While prison riots are not uncommon in Brazil, the number of those killed at Carandiru and the slow pace of the Brazilian justice system in bringing the accused to trial has shocked the public.Carandiru was closed in 2002, shortly after inmates co-ordinated simultaneous uprisings in 27 jails across Sao Paulo state during which thousands of visitors were held hostage.",
        "Reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of a symmetric light pulse, thecarrying frequency of which is close to the frequency of interband transitionsin a quantum well, are calculated. Energy levels of the quantum well areassumed discrete, and two closely located excited levels are taken intoaccount. A wide quantum well (the width of which is comparable to the length ofthe light wave, corresponding to the pulse carrying frequency) is considered,and the dependance of the interband matrix element of the momentum operator onthe light wave vector is taken into account. Refractive indices of barriers andquantum well are assumed equal each other. The problem is solved for anarbitrary ratio of radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronicexcitations. It is shown that the spatial dispersion essentially affects theshapes of reflected and transmitted pulses. The largest changes occur when theradiative broadening is close to the difference of frequencies of interbandtransitions taken into account.",
        "Rapidly oscillating potentials with a vanishing time average have been usedfor a long time to trap charged particles in source-free regions. It has beenargued that the motion of a particle in such a potential can be approximatelydescribed by a time independent effective potential, which does not depend uponthe initial phase of the oscillating potential. However, here we show that themotion of a particle and its trapping condition significantly depend upon thisinitial phase for arbitrarily high frequencies of the potential's oscillation.We explain this novel phenomenon by showing that the motion of a particle isdetermined by the effective potential stated in the literature only if itsinitial conditions are transformed according to a transformation which we showto significantly depend on the potential's initial phase for arbitrarily highfrequencies. We confirm our theoretical findings by numerical simulations.Further, we demonstrate that the found phenomenon offers new ways to manipulatethe dynamics of particles which are trapped by rapidly oscillating potentials.Finally, we propose a simple experiment to verify the theoretical findings ofthis work.",

        "At the quantization of fields, due to the non-linear character of the timereversal, the creation-annihilation operators for the negative frequency modesshould be replaced to the operators of antiparticles not directly in the fieldoperators, but in the operator products. For the standard minimal Lagrangians(asymmetrical under the complex conjugated fields) it is shown that the chargeconjugation (C-) symmetry conditions for the Hamiltonian and the chargeoperator lead to the identities for the operator products allowing one toreplace the negative frequency operator products to the positive frequencyones. At the same time the operators in observables become normal ordered andthe zero-point energy does not appear. Only the symmetrized under the fieldoperators Lagrangians lead to the zero-point energy.

The abuse from the travelling support directed at him in the recent draw with Rotherham was vociferous and I understand that his position was very much hanging in the balance from then on.Coyle can rightly claim that he wasn't backed in terms of budget. He was given £250,000 to spend in the summer while he recouped in excess of £10m and the January transfer window saw him frustrated that the club failed to land his list of potential targets.The fact that Rovers haven't been higher than 20th all season is the reason behind his departure. Financially they can ill afford relegation to League One, and whoever comes in has 15 games to save them.Since the takeover of the club by Venky's in November 2010, the club are now looking to appoint a seventh permanent manager.",

Some can flood cities, or cause earthquakes. Sources are heavily regulated, brought into an Organization the moment they gain access to their Ryoku. At that point, the Organization' s board members decide which to train and which to let go. Those who are let go are Silenced, cut off from their Ryoku.

I guess it would be OK if you like your chicken parm buried in veggies and cheese. Me? I like my chicken parmesan to be mostly, you know, chicken. It wasn't bad, mind you, but I can make a better dish at home and I am certainly not an Italian restaurant. Can't say I recommend the meal I had here this day.

        "We present results of the analysis of cometary X-ray spectra with an extendedversion of our charge exchange emission model (Bodewits et al. 2006). We haveapplied this model to the sample of 8 comets thus far observed with the ChandraX-ray observatory and ACIS spectrometer in the 300-1000 eV range. The surveyedcomets are C/1999 S4 (LINEAR), C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley), C/2000 WM1(LINEAR), 153P/2002 (Ikeya-Zhang), 2P/2003 (Encke), C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), 9P/2005(Tempel 1) and 73P/2006-B (Schwassmann-Wachmann 3) and the observations includea broad variety of comets, solar wind environments and observationalconditions. The interaction model is based on state selective, velocitydependent charge exchange cross sections and is used to explore how cometaryX-ray emission depend on cometary, observational and solar windcharacteristics. It is further demonstrated that cometary X-ray spectra mainlyreflect the state of the local solar wind. The current sample of Chandraobservations was fit using the constrains of the charge exchange model, andrelative solar wind abundances were derived from the X-ray spectra. Ouranalysis showed that spectral differences can be ascribed to different solarwind states, as such identifying comets interacting with (I) fast, cold wind,(II), slow, warm wind and (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated withinterplanetary coronal mass ejections. We furthermore predict the existence ofa fourth spectral class, associated with the cool, fast high latitude wind.",
        "Hard processes leading to high transverse momentum hadron production arecalculable in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) for proton-protoncollisions. In heavy-ion collisions, such processes occur as well, and due to aseparation of scales are calculable on the level of the production of high p_Tpartons. These subsequently interact with the medium which originates fromsemi-hard and soft processes in the same collision before they hadronize. Thepresence of the medium thus modifies the momentum spectrum of outgoing partonsand thus hard hadrons. The idea of jet tomography is to study this modificationin order to learn about the medium density distribution. While this is acompelling idea, its practical application encounters some difficulties. Inthis paper, the capability of various observables to provide tomographicinformation about the medium is discussed and compared.",

Our waitress wasn't unfriendly, but didn't really go out of her way to talk much with us. nnAfter perusing the menu for a bit, the fella ordered a Greek salad with chicken while I went for the crepe-hotcake dish. Food came out pretty fast, but that was sadly the best part about it. nnMy companion's tiny salad was served in a large silver bowl, like the chef had mixed it up and decided better of putting it on an actual plate.

        "Terry was Joe' s Hobbes: light hearted, adventurous, insightful, playful and, of course, a soft adorable animal. The difference was though, Terry was real. Terry was a local squirrel that he had met a day ago on the way home from school, passing through the small nature reserve opposite his house. Walking down the well worn dirt path, Terry locked eyes with his soon to be best friend. Neither twitched a muscle -- Joe' s young blue eyes locked with Terry' s large round brown eyes. Something passed between them. Terry was old, lonely and wanted company: Joe realised this. Old grey streaked through his tail and the nimbleness that squirrels are known for had left him months ago. There were no longer any other squirrel friends in the area, their homes destroyed to make way for urban sprawl. He found happiness from Joe, a sense of peace with the world. From that moment onwards, Terry would n' t leave his side. It was a match made in heaven: they both liked to climb large knobbly trees, scurry around amongst the autumn leaves making growling animal noises as they went, and collect funny little objects they found on the ground. Whenever Joe got cold, he would like to warm his hands up by stroking Terry' s exposed innards. They had a tendency to fall out of the small incision that Joe had made on Terry' s underbelly earlier that afternoon, with a sharpened tree branch they had both found. He did n' t want him dying and going completely cold, so he only let the life seep out slowly. The sun was setting on the day after they met, Joe was holding Terry in his arms like a baby, rocking him back and forth. The warmth was n' t going to last much longer. The rusted nails protruding from Terry' s tiny paws would occasionally scratch up at the sky he could no longer see, searching for a place he knew was once safe, a place where there was no Joe, a place in the tree. -- -- - *As always, feedback appreciated.

        "An extensive literature exists describing various techniques for theevaluation of Hankel determinants. The prevailing methods such as Dodgsoncondensation, continued fraction expansion, LU decomposition, all produceproduct formulas when they are applicable. We mention the classic case of theHankel determinants with binomial entries ${3k+2 \\choose k}$ and those withentries ${3k \\choose k}$; both of these classes of Hankel determinants haveproduct form evaluations. The intermediate case, ${3k+1 \\choose k}$ has notbeen evaluated. There is a good reason for this: these latter determinants donot have product form evaluations.  In this paper we evaluate the Hankel determinant of ${3k+1 \\choose k}$. Theevaluation is a sum of a small number of products, an almost product.  The method actually provides more, and as applications, we present thesalient points for the evaluation of a number of other Hankel determinants withpolynomial entries, along with product and almost product form evaluations atspecial points.",

        "The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of thetheory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (orintrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and mostcommonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,Landesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible,semi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent,$C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent ofthe second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like,$R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constantcurvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The globaldefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Variousrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finslermanifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are provedglobally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interestingidentities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and thecurvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirelyglobal, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a localcounterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the specialFinsler spaces considered.",
        "Environmental dielectric screening effects on exciton transition energies insingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been studied quantitatively in therange of dielectric constants from 1.0 to 37 by immersing SWNTs bridged overtrenches in various organic solvents by means of photoluminescence and theexcitation spectroscopies. With increasing environmental dielectric constant($\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$), both $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ exhibited a redshift byseveral tens meV and a tendency to saturate at a $\\epsilon_{\\rm env} \\sim 5$without an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The redshifts can beexplained by dielectric screening of the repulsive electron-electroninteraction. The $\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$ dependence of $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ canbe expressed by a simple empirical equation with a power law in $\\epsilon_{\\rmenv}$, $E_{\\rm ii} = E_{\\rm ii}^{\\infty} + A\\epsilon_{\\rm env}^{-\\alpha}$. Wealso immersed a sample in sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) solution to investigatethe effects of wrapping SWNTs with surfactant. The resultant $E_{11}$ and$E_{22}$, which agree well with Weisman's data [Nano Lett. {\\bf 3}, 1235(2003)], are close to those of $\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$ of 2. However, in additionto the shift due to dielectric screening, another shift was observed so thatthe ($2n+m$)-family patterns spread more widely, similar to that of theuniaxial-stress-induced shift.",

        "We study the growth of cosmological perturbations in the model ofLorentz-violating massive gravity. The Friedman equation in this model acquiresan unconventional term due to the Lorentz-breaking condensates which has theequation of state w = -1 / (3 gamma) with gamma being a free parameter takingvalues outside of the range [0,1/3]. Apart from the standard contributions, theperturbations above the Friedmann background contain an extra piece which isproportional to an arbitrary function theta(x) of the space coordinates. Thisfunction appears as an integration constant and corresponds to anon-propagating scalar mode which may, however, become dynamical with theaccount of the higher-derivative corrections. For -1 < gamma < 0 and gamma = 1the ``anomalous'' perturbations grow slower than the standard ones and thus themodel is compatible with observations. Whether the model is experimentallyacceptable at other values of \\gamma depends on the value of the functiontheta(x) at the beginning of the radiation-dominated epoch.",

I would return just for that dish. For an entree, I had the seared rare tuna. They definitely didn't skimp on my portion of tuna and cooked it well. Granted tuna is a bit bland, I was hoping for more seasoning and oomph from the Korean barbecue sauce. The ginger fried rice made up for any disappointment I had with the tuna. For dessert, the chocolate pretzel stack was fantastic- perfect mix of chocolate, sweet caramel and the salty wonton chip. nnDrinks: nThe old fashioned was well-executed. Went back for a second. Can't speak for any of their other cocktails.",
        "Charbonnier, known as \"Charb\", was 47. He had received death threats in the past and had been under police protection.Reports say he was in an editorial meeting with the others when two masked gunmen burst in and opened fire with Kalashnikov assault rifles. The gunmen reportedly shouted \"Allahu akbar!\" (God is great).The left-wing magazine's famous cartoonists went by nicknames - the others who died were called Cabu, Tignous and Wolinski.Charb had strongly defended Charlie Hebdo's cartoons featuring the Prophet Muhammad.\"Muhammad isn't sacred to me,'' he told the Associated Press in 2012, after the magazine's offices had been fire-bombed.\"I don't blame Muslims for not laughing at our drawings. I live under French law.

        "AIM: We have recently developed a microscopic Monte Carlo approach to studysurface chemistry on interstellar grains and the morphology of ice mantles. Themethod is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equationformalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method ina chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phaseand surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small numberof diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbondioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulationis started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but nosurface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flator rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, Oand CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under theconditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to asignificant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which inturn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surfacechemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermaldesorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assortedmolecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allowsdetermination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. Themantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide,carbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other thana slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreementwith observations.",
        "If the recent PVLAS results on polarization changes of a linearly polarizedlaser beam passing through a magnetic field are interpreted by an axion-likeparticle, it is almost certain that it is not a standard QCD axion. Consideringthis, we study the general effective interactions of photons with spin-zeroparticles without restricting the latter to be a pseudo-scalar or a scalar,i.e., a parity eigenstate. At the lowest order in effective field theory, thereare two dimension-5 interactions, each of which has previously been treatedseparately for a pseudo-scalar or a scalar particle. By following the evolutionin an external magnetic field of the system of spin-zero particles and photons,we compute the changes in light polarization and the transition probability fortwo experimental set-ups: one-way propagation and round-trip propagation. Whilethe first may be relevant for astrophysical sources of spin-zero particles, thesecond applies to laboratory optical experiments like PVLAS. In the one-waypropagation, interesting phenomena can occur for special configurations ofpolarization where, for instance, transition occurs but light polarization doesnot change. For the round-trip propagation, however, the standard results ofpolarization changes for a pseudoscalar or a scalar are only modified by afactor that depends on the relative strength of the two interactions.",
        "ASTROD I is planned as a single spacecraft mission. It will useinterferometric and pulse ranging techniques between the spacecraft and groundstations, to make high precision measurements of the parameters that describethe solar system, and to test relativistic gravity with improved accuracy. Atthe heart of the spacecraft is a test mass, which the spacecraft will followusing a drag-free control system. The mission critically depends on maintainingthe geodesic motion of the test mass. Charging of the test mass due to cosmicrays and solar particles will disturb its geodesic motion. We have modelled thecharging process using the GEANT4 toolkit and a simplified, geometrical modeland estimate that the ASTROD I test mass will charge positively, at a rate of24 +/-7 e+/s, due to cosmic ray protons and alpha particles (3He and 4He) atsolar minimum. We have used the results of this simulation to estimate themagnitude of disturbances associated with test mass charging, for theworst-case scenario, taking into account uncertainties in the model andpotential charging contributions from minor cosmic-ray components.",

        "We present a local interpretation of what is usually considered to be anonlocal de Broglie-Bohm trajectory prescription for an entangled singlet stateof massive particles. After reviewing various meanings of the term``nonlocal'', we show that by using appropriately retarded wavefunctions (i.e.,the locality loophole) this local model can violate Bell's inequality, withoutmaking any appeal to detector inefficiencies.  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massivetwo-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles arenot ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) canpropagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to theother detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a localinterpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in aStern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detectorloophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is onlysignificant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the localityloophole.",

The one rabbit is (per statement vet) not going to get better. Yet, he still drew blood and several yelled codes to the techs. He also drew blood from the other bunny and yelled similar codes to the back. Turns out each of these \"codes\" he yelled back was a blood test for which they charged about $60 a piece. The one bunny also got 2 injections: 0. 3 ml of PenG was $41. 72 (mind the fact that I have this bottle of PenG at home because the vet put the other bunny on this medication weeks ago, so he should/ could have remembered that and just let me give the injection at home if that's what they charge for this!

When I explained that I feel that the vet has a responsibility to keep a pet owner posted when he is about to rack up a hefty bill with a bunch of tests, she said that the vet just wanted to be thorough.

In order to fully benefit from itscapabilities and to maximize the scientific return from the LAT, it is of greatimportance to conduct dedicated multi-frequency monitoring campaigns that willresult comprehensive observations. Consequently, we initiated an effort toconduct a GLAST-dedicated, quasi-simultaneous, broad-band flux-density (andpolarization) monitoring of potential GLAST blazars with the Effelsberg andOVRO radio telescopes (11cm to 7mm wavelength).

        "Objectives: In this study, we quantify the growth variability of tumour cellclones from a human leukemia cell line. Materials and methods: We have usedmicroplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds ofindividual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonalpopulation has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logisticequation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among differentclones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rateof the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of theiroffsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclonesdid not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggestingthat growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observeddistributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic modelassuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successivecell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,we have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average numberof mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observeddistributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria wererendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonalgrowth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cellpopulation is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. Atleast part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number ofmitochondria.",
        "Astronomers carry out observations to explore the diverse processes andobjects which populate our Universe. High-energy physicists carry outexperiments to approach the Fundamental Theory underlying space, time andmatter. Dark Energy is a unique link between them, reflecting deep aspects ofthe Fundamental Theory, yet apparently accessible only through astronomicalobservation. Large sections of the two communities have therefore converged insupport of astronomical projects to constrain Dark Energy. In this essay Iargue that this convergence can be damaging for astronomy. The two communitieshave different methodologies and different scientific cultures. By uncriticallyadopting the values of an alien system, astronomers risk undermining thefoundations of their own current success and endangering the future vitality oftheir field. Dark Energy is undeniably an interesting problem to attack throughastronomical observation, but it is one of many and not necessarily the onewhere significant progress is most likely to follow a major investment ofresources.",
        "A significant fraction of Lyman Alpha (Lya) emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z>5.7 have rest-frame equivalent widths (EW) greater than ~100 Angstrom. Howeveronly a small fraction of the Lya flux produced by a galaxy is transmittedthrough the IGM, which implies intrinsic Lya EWs that are in excess of themaximum allowed for a population-II stellar population having a Salpeter massfunction. In this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering Lyaemission in high redshift galaxies. We propose a simple model for Lya emittersin which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that resultsin a large intrinsic EW, followed by a phase of population-II star formationwith a lower EW. We confront this model with a range of high redshiftobservations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe thefollowing eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population withplausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of starformation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5,v-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies atz=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) theobserved correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that theobserved anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of verymassive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of thegalaxies star forming lifetime. This very massive star formation may indicatethe presence of population-III star formation in a few per cent of i-dropgalaxies, and in about half of the Lya selected galaxies.",

We Martians were much better, all recorded fairly and accurately so the truth was never in doubt. Firearms were, of course, completely unnecessary. The Earthlings had always had weapons because, even from the earliest days, in their pre-history, they had needed to defend themselves against savage neighbours. We were n' t savages, so we had never needed weapons. Disputes were resolved fairly, quickly and with the utmost consideration, after all, we are all Martians and all interested in the same goal, the prominence and wellbeing of the Mars colony. See, the thing is, I' m part of the original Mars colony. I was in the third resettling phase. These fifth phase resettlers are n' t.... quite like us. I heard from my neighbours that some of them were thieves, rapists and murderers. Sure, we have those things on the Mars colony, but these events are so rare as to be nearly non-existant. Surely nobody can blame me for having a firearm, right? It' s just self defence. I have a family after all, two girls, any father has a right to be protective. Is n' t that so? My neighbours are having their firearms made tomorrow, it' s just a safety measure. We' ve always had peace, this is just a precaution. Just a precaution..... I never trusted those fifth wave immigrants.",
        "More than 400 firearms were found in the home of Wyverstone Parish Council chairman James Arnold last year.He was due to face firearms charges but died of cancer, aged 49, in July 2014.Anthony Buckland, 65, from Stoke Holy Cross, Norfolk, is on trial at Norwich Crown Court and denies selling prohibited weapons.He also denies fraud by false representation.Prosecutor Andrew Oliver told the court the discovery in Wyverstone, near Stowmarket, was the \"biggest stash of weapons this country had ever experienced\".Opening the case last week, Mr Oliver said firearms including air rifles, pistols, handguns, shotguns and automatic machine guns were found in a secret room in Mr Arnold's house.The room was accessed through a hidden door in his kitchen.Officers also found a safe behind a false wall.No explanation of why Mr Arnold amassed the arms has been offered to the jury.Mr Buckland told the court he had known Mr Arnold for more than 25 years.He said he had legally supplied him with guns and ammunition but would never have procured illegal firearms.Asked about news coverage of the find, Mr Buckland said he had been \"glued to the television\" but had not been worried about his involvement.\"There is no link to me because I had never supplied Arnold with anything illegal,\" he added. \"I didn't start to panic whatsoever.\"The court learned Mr Buckland supplied 26 weapons to a man called JJ Hambrose, 16 of which were found at Mr Arnold's home.The prosecution has claimed Hambrose was a fictitious character.But Mr Buckland insisted Hambrose was a genuine customer he had known since the 1980s.He denies 20 counts, some of which relate to Mr Arnold and some to other customers.He had converted many of the weapons, supposedly to make them legal, but the court has heard such a conversion was not technically possible.The trial continues.",

        "Reverend Mike Barnsley of St John's Church in Cinderford, Gloucestershire, said damage caused to his graveyard by the animals has caused \"upset and distress\".Some residents claim people are feeding the boar which encourages the animals into towns and villages.West Dean Parish Council said it has formed an action committee.Tim Gwilliam, district and parish councillor for Berry Hill, said culls are not working.He said: \"Perhaps it's the tactics that need addressing. We need to put it right.\"There is nothing worse than somebody's grave being turned over. It's horrendous. It's 2017 and we can't allow this to happen.\"Rev Barnsley said it is \"very upsetting\" for families who have visited the graves of their loved ones at St John's to see \"this sort of mess\".Despite years of culling, the last count put the number of boar in the region at nearly 1,600 - more than 500 up on the year before.The target population for the Forestry Commission is 400.Wild boars were hunted to extinction in England in the 17th century, but 12 years ago about 60 farmed animals were illegally dumped in the Forest of Dean.The Forestry Commission said six wildlife rangers have been deployed on this season's cull, and details will be released when it finishes later in the spring.",
        "One of the most surprising discoveries of extrasolar planets is the detectionof planets in moderately close binary star systems. The Jovian-type planets inthe two binaries of Gamma Cephei and GJ 86 have brought to the forefrontquestions on the formation of giant planets and the possibility of theexistence of smaller bodies in such dynamically complex environments. Thediverse dynamical characteristics of these objects have made scientists wonderto what extent the current theories of planet formation can be applied tobinaries and multiple star systems. At present, the sensitivity of thedetection techniques does not allow routine discovery of Earth-sized bodies inbinary systems. However, with the advancement of new techniques, and with therecent launch of CoRoT and the launch of Kepler in late 2008, the detection ofmore planets (possibly terrestrial-class objects) in such systems is on thehorizon. Theoretical studies and numerical modeling of terrestrial andhabitable planet formation are, therefore, necessary to gain fundamentalinsights into the prospects for life in such systems and have great strategicimpact on NASA science and missions.",

        "We analyse star formation in the nuclei of 9 Seyfert galaxies at spatialresolutions down to 0.085arcsec, corresponding to length scales of less than10pc in some objects. Our data were taken mostly with the near infraredadaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profilestypically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

I had been looking forward to this ever since I was a child and watched little nicky, the idea that Satan was n' t as evil as he appeared had stuck with me for 20 years. Now I was about to find out if it was true. I recited the spell. shadows filled the room and swirled around the ground and up the walls. circling in a demonic dance, moving faster and faster. suddenly darkness took the room and smoke from the newly extinguished candles filled my nostrils. There was a red glow at the center of the room, but i couldnt quite make out what it was. some sort of vapor had filled the basement and I was having a hard time seeing. as the smoke started to settle. I saw it, a slightly glowing silhouette of a big man. he started to move, and as he moved closer i could tell that his belly was big, and his cheeks were flushed. his white beard reaching almos to his belly button. he wore a red coat that shimmered with a dull red glow, and he wore a crown made of deer antlers and chirstmas tree branches. He had a twinkle in his eye that just said *everything is ok* I said \" who are you? \" and the man replied \" I have many names. but the one you would be most familiar with is santa \" his warm voice vibrated in my ears as if he were speaking through a silky and soothing jazz tune. his eyes twinkled as he spoke to me. I questioned him further \" well, how did you get here? \" without even a slight pause he asked \" do you trust me, son? \" well I suppose I do n' t have a reason not to, you are santa after all. \" he pulled me close, gave me a big hug and whispered softly in my ear \" thats good, son. because the only way i can steal your soul is if you trust me. \"",

        "With an aim towards understanding the time-dependence of entanglement entropyin generic quantum field theories, we propose a covariant generalization of theholographic entanglement entropy proposal of hep-th/0603001. Apart fromproviding several examples of possible covariant generalizations, we study aparticular construction based on light-sheets, motivated in similar spirit tothe covariant entropy bound underlying the holographic principle. Inparticular, we argue that the entanglement entropy associated with a specifiedregion on the boundary in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence is given bythe area of a co-dimension two bulk surface with vanishing expansions of nullgeodesics. We demonstrate our construction with several examples to illustrateits reduction to the holographic entanglement entropy proposal in staticspacetimes. We further show how this proposal may be used to understand thetime evolution of entanglement entropy in a time varying QFT state dual to acollapsing black hole background. Finally, we use our proposal to argue thatthe Euclidean wormhole geometries with multiple boundaries should be regardedas states in a non-interacting but entangled set of QFTs, one associated toeach boundary.",

Related closed geometries have generatedinterest as candidates for a repulsive force. By using an optical pathexpansion we solve exactly the case of a piston with a rectangular crosssection, and find that the force always attracts the partition to the nearestbase. For arbitrary cross sections, we can use an expansion for the density ofstates to compute the force in the limit of small height to width ratios. Thecorrections to the force between parallel plates are found to have interestingdependence on the shape of the cross section.

        "Phonon transmission across epitaxial interfaces is studied within the latticedynamic approach. The transmission shows weak dependence on frequency for thelattice wave with a fixed angle of incidence. The dependence on azimuth angleis found to be related to the symmetry of the boundary interface. Thetransmission varies smoothly with the change of the incident angle. A criticalangle of incidence exists when the phonon is incident from the side with largegroup velocities to the side with low ones. No significant mode conversion isobserved among different acoustic wave branches at the interface, except whenthe incident angle is near the critical value. Our theoretical result of theKapitza conductance $G_{K}$ across the Si-Ge (100) interface at temperature$T=200 $K is $4.6\\times10^{8} {\\rm WK}^{-1}{\\rmm}^{-2}$. A scaling law $G_K\\propto T^{2.87}$ at low temperature is also reported. Based on the features oftransmission obtained within lattice dynamic approach, we propose a simplifiedformula for thermal conductanceacross the epitaxial interface. A reasonableconsistency is found between the calculated values and the experimentallymeasured ones.",

        "Several stars orbit around a black hole candidate of mass $3.7\\times 10^6$M$_{\\odot}$, in the region of the Galactic Center (GC). Looking for GeneralRelativistic (GR) periastron shifts is limited by the existence of a stellarcluster around the black hole that would modify the orbits due to classicaleffects that might mask the GR effect. Only if one knows the cluster parameters(its mass and core radius) it is possible to unequivocally deduce the GReffects expected and then test them. In this paper it is shown that theobservation of the proper motion of Sgr A$^*$, $v_{Sgr A^*} = (0.4\\pm 0.9)$ kms$^{-1}$ (\\citealt{reid2004}), could help us to constrain the clusterparameters significantly and that future measurements of the periastron shiftsfor at least three stars may adequately determine the cluster parameters andthe mass of the black hole.",

        "When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretchelastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. Thesedistortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramaticeffect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transportalong DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture theelectronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, webegin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronicstates in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurationsencountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results arecomplemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the statesof a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronicstates are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that candescribe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as thepresence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of thesubstrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian whichleads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by severalorders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretchedstructure.",

        "The soft X-ray background shows a general enhancement toward the inner regionof the Galaxy. But whether this enhancement is a local feature (e.g., asuperbubble within a distance of <= 200 pc) and/or a phenomenon related toenergetic outflows from the Galactic center/bulge remains unclear. Here wereport a comparative X-ray emission and absorption study of diffuse hot gasalong the sight lines toward 3C 273 and Mrk 421, on and off the enhancement,but at similar Galactic latitudes. The diffuse 3/4-keV emission intensity, asestimated from the ROSAT All Sky Survey, is about three times higher toward 3C273 than toward Mrk 421. Based on archival \\chandra grating observations ofthese two AGNs, we detect X-ray absorption lines (e.g., OVII Kalpha, Kbeta, andOVIII Kalpha transitions at z~0) and find that the mean hot gas thermal andkinematic properties along the two sight lines are significantly different. Bysubtracting the foreground and background contribution, as determined along theMrk 421 sight line, we isolate the net X-ray absorption and emission producedby the hot gas associated with the enhancement in the direction of 3C 273. Froma joint analysis of these differential data sets, we obtain the temperature,dispersion velocity, and hydrogen column density as 2.0(1.6, 2.3)E6 K,216(104,480) km/s, and 2.2(1.4, 4.1)E19 cm^{-2}, respectively (90% confidenceintervals), assuming that the gas is approximately isothermal, solar in metalabundances, and equilibrium in collisional ionization. We also constrain theeffective line-of-sight extent of the gas to be 3.4(1.0, 10.1) kpc, stronglysuggesting that the enhancement most likely represents a Galactic centralphenomenon.",

        "We investigate the growth of half metallic phase in a ferromagnetic materialusing state-of-the-art full potential linearized augmented plane wave method.To address the issue, we have substituted Ti at the Ru-sites in SrRuO3, whereSrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic material. Calculated results establish Ti4+ valencestates (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Tisubstitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in thecalculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finitegap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appearsat the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spinstates contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallicferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ticoncentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneckto achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials.This study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicityin ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-basedtechnology.",

        "We present an initial analysis of AKARI 18um-selected galaxies using all 9photometric bands at 2-24um available in the InfraRed Camera (IRC), in order todemonstrate new capabilities of AKARI cosmological surveys. We detected 72sources at 18um in an area of 50.2 arcmin^2 in the AKARI/IRC monitor fieldtowards the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP). From this sample, 25 galaxies withprobable redshifts z>~ 0.5 are selected with a single colour cut (N2-N3>0.1)for a detailed SED analysis with ground-based BVRi'z'JK data. Using an SEDradiative transfer model of starbursts covering the wavelength range UV --submm, we derive photometric redshifts from the optical-MIR SEDs of18um-selected galaxies. From the best-fit SED models, we show that the IRCall-band photometry is capable of tracing the steep rise in flux at the blueside of the PAH 6.2um emission feature. This indicates that the IRC all-bandphotometry is useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies,specifically for dusty galaxies with a less prominent 4000A break. Also, wefind that the flux dip between the PAH 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature isrecognizable in the observed SEDs of galaxies at z~1. By using such a colouranomaly due to the PAH and silicate absorption features, unique samples ofULIRGs at z~1, `silicate-break' galaxies, can be constructed from largecosmological surveys of AKARI towards the NEP, i.e. the NEP-Deep and NEP-Widesurvey. This pilot study suggests the possibility of detecting many interestinggalaxy properties in the NEP-Deep and Wide surveys, such as a systematicdifference in SEDs between high- and low-z ULIRGs, and a large variation of thePAH inter-band strength ratio in galaxies at high redshifts.

        "Analytical approaches to galaxy formation and reionization are based on themathematical problem of random walks with barriers. The statistics of a singlerandom walk can be used to calculate one-point distributions ranging from themass function of virialized halos to the distribution of ionized bubble sizesduring reionization. However, an analytical calculation of two-pointcorrelation functions or of spatially-dependent feedback processes requires thejoint statistics of random walks at two different points. An accurateanalytical expression for the statistics of two correlated random walks hasbeen previously found only for the case of a constant barrier height. However,calculating bubble sizes or accurate statistics for halo formation involvesmore general barriers that can often be approximated as linear barriers. Wegeneralize the two-point solution with constant barriers to linear barriers,and apply it as an illustration to calculate the correlation function ofcosmological 21-cm fluctuations during reionization.",

        "Quantum gravity is analyzed from the viewpoint of the renormalization group.The analysis is based on methods introduced by J. Polchinski concerning theperturbative renormalization with flow equations. In the first part of thiswork, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and thenextended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is donefor a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions forsome of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains astatement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below theUV cutoff. In particular, nonrenormalizable theories can be treated withoutproblems in the proposed framework. In the second part, the standard covariantBRS quantization program for Euclidean Einstein gravity is applied. A momentumcutoff regularization is imposed and the resulting violation of theSlavnov-Taylor identities is discussed. Deriving Polchinski's renormalizationgroup equation for Euclidean quantum gravity, the predictivity of effectivequantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale is investigated with flowequations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Tayloridentities is proposed and it is argued that in the effective quantum gravitycontext, the restoration will only be accomplished with finite accuracy.Finally, the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity is analyzed from theviewpoint of the Polchinski method. It is speculated whether a limit withnonvanishing gravitational constant might exist where the latter wouldultimatively be determined by the cosmological constant and the masses of theelementary particles.",

        "General Turk sat at his desk reviewing the file for one of the world' s greatest threats. His assistant Maria stood in the corner with a confused look on her face. Her boss spent hours every day looking for weaknesses and drawing up strategies to bring his opponent down. She had been afraid to even ask what or who could possible demand this level of attention. Today was the last day she would just ignorantly observe. Today she walked over to the Generals desk and asked her boss to explain his current almost hateful obsession. After only an hour she too hated this monster of a man who wielded a terrifying ability to breach human' s mental walls. Maria didn' t even want to think about all the potentially horrifying things he could do, wipe memories, control thoughts, and even kill people on a whim. What made things worse he was so powerful he wasn' t limited to one person at a time. Records had shown him using his powers on several people simultaneously without effort. Rumors had spread that he had even built devices to enhance his powers, one such device took up an entire room and with it he could easily expand his powers across the entire globe if he concentrated hard enough. He was as nefariously smart as he was lethal. This scoundrel didn' t even hide. Everyone in authority knew where he lived. He even had his name in bronze on the entrance gates to one of the largest properties in Westchester County. What made him difficult to get to was he surrounded himself with children. He built an army of innocent human shields to protect him by appearing to run a boarding house for the \"misunderstood \"young. Simply killing him would be a P. R. nightmare especially considering his obvious physical disability and charitable contributions to the community. Maria knew that power corrupts and this man had power most gods would envy.

        "[ABRIDGED] We recently presented evidence of a connection between thebrightness profiles of nearby early-type galaxies and the properties of the AGNthey host. The radio loudness of the AGN appears to be univocally related tothe host's brightness profile: radio-loud nuclei are only hosted by ``core''galaxies while radio-quiet AGN are only found in ``power-law'' galaxies. Weextend our analysis here to a sample of 42 nearby (V < 7000 km/s) Seyfertgalaxies hosted by early-type galaxies. We used the available HST images tostudy their brightness profiles. Having excluded complex and highly nucleatedgalaxies, in the remaining 16 objects the brightness profiles can besuccessfully modeled with a Nuker law with a steep nuclear cusp characteristicof ``power-law'' galaxies (with logarithmic slope 0.51 - 1.07). This result iswhat is expected for these radio-quiet AGN based on our previous findings, thusextending the validity of the connection between brightness profile and radioloudness to AGN of a far higher luminosity. We explored the robustness of thisresult against a different choice of the analytic form for the brightnessprofiles, using a Sersic law. In no object could we find evidence of a centrallight deficit with respect to a pure Sersic model, the defining feature of``core'' galaxies in this modeling framework. We conclude that, regardless ofthe modeling strategy, the dichotomy of AGN radio loudness can be univocallyrelated to the host's brightness profile. Our general results can be re-phrasedas ``radio-loud nuclei are hosted by core galaxies, while radio-quiet AGN arefound in non-core galaxies''.",

The Asian fusion made for a delicious alternative to the typical calamari that was reminiscent of a General Tso's squid.

        "The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum ofelliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear thatthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning starswithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their originhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost theirenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarfpopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary populationsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on thebinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hotsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproducesmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range ofobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolutionwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostictools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications forunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies ingeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, ashad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be stronglydependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally fromdwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.",

        "``Top--down'' models explain the observation of ultra high energy cosmic rays(UHECR; $E \\gsim 5 \\cdot 10^{19}$ eV) through the decay of very massive,long--lived ``$X$ particles''. If superparticles with masses near a TeV exist,$X$ decays also lead to a significant flux of very energetic neutralinos,assumed to be the (stable or long--lived) lightest superparticles. There is arange of energies where neutrinos get absorbed in the Earth, but neutralinoscan still traverse it. These neutralinos could in principle be detected. Wecalculate the detection rate in planned experiments such as OWL and EUSO. Forbino--like neutralinos, which have been considered previously, we finddetection rates below 1 event per Teraton of target and year in all cases;often the rates are much smaller. In contrast, if the neutralino ishiggsino--like, more than ten events per year per Teraton might be observed, ifthe mass of the $X$ particle is near its lower bound of $\\sim 10^{12}$ GeV.",
        "Kernel-based nonparametric hazard rate estimation is considered with aspecial class of infinite-order kernels that achieves favorable bias and meansquare error properties. A fully automatic and adaptive implementation of adensity and hazard rate estimator is proposed for randomly right censored data.Careful selection of the bandwidth in the proposed estimators yields estimatesthat are more efficient in terms of overall mean squared error performance, andin some cases achieves a nearly parametric convergence rate. Additionally,rapidly converging bandwidth estimates are presented for use in second-orderkernels to supplement such kernel-based methods in hazard rate estimation.Simulations illustrate the improved accuracy of the proposed estimator againstother nonparametric estimators of the density and hazard function.

        "The frequency distribution of DNA bases A, C, G, T exhibit fractalfluctuations ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature. The power spectra offractal fluctuations exhibit inverse power law form signifying long-rangecorrelations between local (small-scale) and global (large-scale)perturbations. The author has developed a general systems theory based onclassical statistical physics for fractal fluctuations which predicts that theprobability distribution of eddy amplitudes and the variance (square of eddyamplitude)spectrum of fractal fluctuations follow the universal Boltzmanninverse power law expressed as a function of the golden mean. The modelpredicted distribution is very close to statistical normal distribution forfluctuations within two standard deviations from the mean and exhibits a fatlong tail. In this paper it is shown that DNA base CG frequency distribution inTakifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) Genome Release 4 exhibit universal inversepower law form consistent with model prediction. The observed long-rangecorrelations in the DNA bases implies that the non-coding 'junk' or 'selfish'DNA which appear to be redundant, may also contribute to the efficientfunctioning of the protein coding DNA, a result supported by recent studies.",

        "As much as I told myself I' d always remember that summer, the doily tablecloth on the porch of that beat up house is more vivid than any of their faces. To a seventeen year old harboring resentment for authority, David' s 4/2 was a sanctuary. He lived in the house alone while his mother was stuck in New York, which meant every couch, bed, and blanket harbored a teenager. I' d never done drugs, smoked cigarettes, or consumed alcohol before that house. In my defense, it' s difficult to say no when so many hours were spent cramped around that table passing the bowl back and forth, back and forth, like we were completing a sacred ritual. I don' t remember why I decided to drink that night… My decision probably hinged on my desire to evoke from Ronnie one of his sly smiles; the one smothered with mischievous approval, given to me every time I tried something he knew was out of my comfort zone. Disenchanted with my Christian high school and uninterested in the ordinary going-ons of my school friends, I longed approval from the dirty drop-outs. Phone in one hand, beer in the other, I spend that whole night leaving drunken voicemails for Samantha. I smoked so many of Brandi' s cigarettes while talking to whoever wandered out to join me. Sandra had just started dating Ronnie…that night knew nothing of the bad times and heroin addiction that would soon turn their lives into wreckage. I guess that is why I remember so vividly the details of the tablecloth that fostered our friendship, because too soon those relationships would break up in a typhoon of theft and abuse. The crack and fizz that first Steel Reserve made while opening it, the secure feeling of belonging after toasting with my friends, and the full-bodied laughter reverberating through the night will be what I hold with me when reminiscing that summer.",

The one in the living area works with the lineup card, while the one in the bedroom has the digital assignments, such as 76-0010 and whatnot, meaning you can't find anything (including HBO), so if you want to actually watch a show, you'll probably end up watching on the hard-as-a-rock sleeper sofa in the living area. nnIf you have to flush the toilet (and many people prefer this option), you lose all water in the bathroom.

Not sure if this is unique to this room, or to the 11th floor, but it is a bit odd. nnThe hot breakfast is, well hot, but the offering wasn't the greatest. In fact, some other quick-serve, business-style hotels offer a better service and they are only deemed \"continental\". If you go to an Embassy Suites, with their made-to-order breakfasts, it's much, much better. nnAll-in-all, we had a passable night, but I'm not sure if I'd stay again.",
        "Ri Ra's is a decently sized (2 medium sized rooms) Irish bar is downtown Charlotte next door to Prohibition. My group stopped in Ri Ra's to meet up with a few others and I was not impressed. nnAfter paying one of the most unjustified $5 covers of my life, I walked in and felt like I had just stepped in to an Ivy League frat party. Suits, sport coats, and even tuxedos everywhere but this bar was nothing to dress up for. The general vibe in this place was very uppity and i had several unpleasant interactions with people. nnA DJ (who was actually pretty good) was playing blaring house music. I normally would have really enjoyed the music but the crowd at Ri Ra's on this night couldn't have cared less about the music. Dancing almost seemed frowned upon based upon what I saw. Not saying that a few bad eggs are representative of the entire bar but on this particular night, Ri Ra's did not live up to expectations.",

        "The soft weight of my daughter' s hand on my own lifted my foggy mind back to semi-consciousness. Light wavered at the center of my vision, distorting my perception of the blue hospital bed fabric. Sand shifted between my toes as the cool sea gently rocked me back and forth, warm summer sun beating down on my shoulders. Instead of seagulls and waves, I heard the beeping of the heart monitor, distant and muffled. It melted into the chiming beat of the song being played by my toddler jumper as I bounced towards my mother' s open arms. Orange lights, green lights, a flash with every step. The dog' s fur brushed across my leg as the ball left my brother' s hand, arcing through the bright sky towards the trees in the back yard. A faraway whistle. The light of a flashlight cut through the leaves, blinding me as we searched for the dog. I remembered our efforts were futile. A gentle tug on my hand drew me back to the soft blue blanket. The nurse passed by the bed to check the monitor. Someone' s tears dripped onto my hand as the light filled my vision again, and then I was falling – falling back into the spectrum of memories. I braced myself for the next sensation. There wasn' t one. Straining against my unraveling mind, I struggled to find a grip on my thoughts. *Was I dying? Where was I? Who was I? * The light was still there. It hungered for more. *Hungered for what --? * A feeling of intense horror sank in as I began to understand. All my memories over the course of a lifetime – the fragments that made up my identity had been siphoned away by this predatory entity that now left me with nothing, as nothing. The pressure on my hand lifted, drawing me senseless, back to the bed. I found myself staring at the tube protruding from an emaciated arm. *My arm? * I couldn' t recall. The light pulled away, disappearing along with my vision as I felt the last pulsations of my heart dwindle into nothing. Darkness enveloped my hapless soul.",

To other vampires we actually appear our age but to humans we have the appearance of someone in their prime. He was still young though and I knew what he had been doing. \" lovely night \" I said, testing the boys nerves. He responded startled \" yyes it was \". \" Tell me youngling why are you here \" I said with no hint of emotion, it took him a minute to realize that what I said required an answer, \" I' m sick of this darkness, the constant death of those I feed on \". \" Ahhh I understand youngling I too have experienced this regret long before your time, but as regretful as you are that sunrise will not kill \". \" WHAT?! \" he shouted or should I day screamed. \" \" You see the sun to a young vampire one who has just been turned is death but to you it will be a mere burn... \", \" AHHH IS THERE ANYWAY OUT OF THIS HELL \" he said with a touch of sadness. \" I knelt down next to him \" For us my friend this is the only way... \" I whispered in his ear, what do yo..? \" And with that he spoke his last as I shoved my arm through his chest not a painless death but the quickest I could offer. three times I have done this to the ones I' ve turned I do n' t know if I ca n' t do it again.",
        "Part of the Westin Hotel, there is a nice decor to the OFM, but the clientele seem to be going elsewhere. nnOur server was very helpful and gave us some suggestions on what to order. We asked about what sushi rolls we could start off with as appetizers for the group, and he suggested two that worked very well. They were both tuna-based, one mild and one spicier. It definitely lives up to the claim that OFM has some good sushi. nnWe then ordered our mains, and I got the cioppino. Now, I'm used to cioppino coming out as a stew with chunks of fish in a broth, but OFM's chef has decided to serve an entire slab of mahi on a thin layer of the broth with the accompanying shellfish. The dish was cooked well, but the presentation (lack of actual stew) left me wanting for more. nnThe caesar salad was pretty good, with actual anchovies on top. nnThe Hawaiian waluu dish got a thumbs up. nnThe crab cakes were also said to be very tasty. nnOverall, the experience was nice and relaxed, and the service is friendly. However, the food itself (besides the sushi) needs to be reinvigorated somehow to get it back into competition with all the new kids on the block.",

        "I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review. Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. nnBuffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters. The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board. nnMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals. So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting. They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch. The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo. nnI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice. It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless. nnI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave. I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service.",
        "Starting with a field theoretic approach in Minkowski space, thegravitational energy momentum tensor is derived from the Einstein equations ina straightforward manner. This allows to present them as {\\it accelerationtensor} = const. $\\times$ {\\it total energy momentum tensor}. For flat spacecosmology the gravitational energy is negative and cancels the material energy.In the relativistic theory of gravitation a bimetric coupling between theRiemann and Minkowski metrics breaks general coordinate invariance. The case ofa positive cosmological constant is considered. A singularity free version ofthe Schwarzschild black hole is solved analytically. In the interior thecomponents of the metric tensor quickly die out, but do not change sign,leaving the role of time as usual. For cosmology the $\\Lambda$CDM model iscovered, while there appears a form of inflation at early times. Here both thetotal energy and the zero point energy vanish.",
        "I' m 25, and ordinarily I would ha e skipped past a post like this, but, now I find myself in deep thought, reflecting on what life was, what life is and what it might be years from now. To put it simply, I want to live long enough to be a Father, a Husband and see my own kids grow up and have some of their own. Beyond that, I do n' t think I would want to live much longer. I never feared death, maybe the pain of dying, but not death itself. I' m not sure what happens when people die, if there is an afterlife or if we just simply cease to exsist. Does n' t really matter to me, this is the only life I' ve got and so far I have no regrets. But, thinking about the possibility of immortality kind of scares me. I mean, life would n' t be exciting after a while. At some point I would imagine that life becomes dull and without value. The reason life is valued so much is because its so short. If you take away life' s limitations you take away the need to live. I like to think of it like cheating in Fallout 4, just a few console commands and I' ve got everything I want, but, now the excitement of the game is gone, there is no challenge. Sure it' s fun for a bit, but, only for a short time. I say, live life while you' re here, enjoy it, not just for yourself, but for all the people you love and care about, it can end in an instant and I' d hate to spend an eternity wishing I would have spent more time with family and friends. No, I do n' t think they should be asking me \" Why? \", instead, they should be asking themselves.",

As we got closer however I realized how big this place was on the inside. It's huge! At least it felt huge from where we were sitting. I'm not sure if it was the article in the magazine that attributed to how crazy busy this place was or if there was a concert or what but this place was insane. I mean we had to wait for an hour for our table. On the plus side we had to wait an hour for our table which meant an hour of drinking so I can't really complain. nnBecause we had been waiting for so long we also had a chance to look at the menu so when we  finally sat down we knew exactly what we wanted; the waitress loved this. We started with the calamari which I'm starting to find out is not one of Wisconsin's strong suits. I don't think I have ever had good calamari here; maybe this will be my next food challenge 'The Great Calamari Showdown'! Anyway, I had a few pieces of that and let the man have the rest'' he actually really liked it. nnI ordered the salad which was huge, cheesy mashed potato, and 3 pieces of the lightly breaded cod. The man order the same but with cheesy hash browns. The fish was pretty good. It was juicy and fresh and not bad. I thought it was maybe just a little over the top with the seasoning. I think I would have enjoyed it more if the flavors were a bit more subtle as opposed to all up in my face the way it was. With that said however I though it was alright. The man on the other hand was in love. He likened his enjoyment of this place to the Tornado Room. Pure blasphemy. He clearly doesn't know anything about food. nnAll in all I am glad I tried this place but I don't think I will be making it a regular haunt.",
        "****nnDixie's Tavern is Steelers central on Sunday's during football season and that is why I enjoy this place, as any other day I think I have gotten too old to go here. nnAtmosphere - Great old (I would say at least 80 yrs old) stand alone brick building. I think it used to have something to do with the train line back in the day. The layout is great with a huge center bar and lots of booths and tables (Sundays are usually standing room only on game day, so fans come early.. . like by noon). nnService - Usually pretty good. Occasionally I will get a waitress I do not like, but most are great, even when crowded and w/rowdy fans. nnFood - There is a Cajun theme to their menu that has surprisingly pretty good quality. Not like impress your date good, but a fun place to take someone you already know fairly well. I usually get their grilled chicken sandwich that comes on a quality roll w/first-rate fries. Their dirty rice is pretty good too. Beer prices are reasonable, especially w/specials like $2 bottles. Dixie's really caters to the Steelers crowd on Sundays, even getting IC Light on occasion. Down side, they occasionally run out of some hard liquor.. . how does that happen?? nnOverall - On a normal weekend night, there are lots of people, no cover and fun familiar music. It is like a big college party. For me, how can I not like a place that plays the 70's Steelers Polka at the end of the game? nnHere we go Steelers, here we go!! !",

        "When my wife and I walked in I thought, this place doesn't look too bad, actually kinda cool. WRONG!

Our food took about 45 minutes, which is absolutely ridiculous for standard breakfast, but I though, everyone thinks this place is great, I guess I can wait for perfection. nnThe food gets to our table, it looks good, it looks like breakfast, but it is cold, well mine was cold. So I'm sitting at the table, empty coffee, cold breakfast and quite pissed off, because of the situation and I'm hungry. Finally after about 10-12 minutes the waitress comes by and asks how everything is, I tell her my food is cold, and I'm fine and don't need another plate, we had already been there over an hour, we had placed to go, ya know. nnWhen the waitress brings the bill over she doesn't just tell me she took my food off, she says, I figured I would take the food off even though you didn't ask (really? should I have to? ). nnWife's food was hot, but she thought it to be just average breakfast. nnI never want to go back, but I will, because I always give places another shot. nnTerribly slow service (server was very nice though, probably home from college), and food took forever. I doubt this place puts out cold food on a regular basis, because this place wouldn't be so packed and highly regarded.",

        "The nine most serious cases have seen flu patients end up in intensive care beds.More than 2,400 people have also seen their GP with the symptoms so far this winter.Dr Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine programme at Public Health Wales, said: \"It's not too late to get vaccinated.\"It comes as visits to GPs, hospital and intensive care admissions have all increased across Wales in the past few weeks.Officials said flu will inevitably add to the burden on accident and emergency departments across many parts of Wales already dealing with existing winter pressures.All age groups have been affected, although young children, the elderly and adults with chronic conditions are particularly vulnerable.Dr Roberts added: \"Recent figures suggest that flu is now circulating across Wales. Although those in risk groups should have been vaccinated by now, it's not too late to get vaccinated.\"The vaccine protects against the most common H1N1 virus.Influenza B viruses are also being detected, which usually affect younger people and children.\"From recent experience, we would expect that the flu virus will be circulating in Wales for six to eight weeks or even longer so it is important to ensure that remaining eligible people are vaccinated as quickly as possible,\" said Dr Roberts.",
        "We investigate the intrinsic shapes of starless cores in the Orion GMC, usingthe prestellar core sample of Nutter and Ward-Thompson (2007), which is basedon submillimeter SCUBA data. We employ a maximum-likelihood method toreconstruct the intrinsic distribution of ellipsoid axial ratios from the axialratios of projected plane-of-the-sky core ellipses. We find that, independentlyof the details of the assumed functional form of the distribution, there is astrong preference for oblate cores of finite thickness. Cores with varyingfinite degrees of triaxiality are a better fit than purely axisymmetric coresalthough cores close to axisymmetry are not excluded by the data. The incidenceof prolate starless cores in Orion is found to be very infrequent. We also testthe consistency of the observed data with a uniform distribution of intrinsicshapes, which is similar to those found in gravoturbulent fragmentationsimulations. This distribution is excluded at the 0.1% level. These findingshave important implications for theories of core formation within molecularclouds.",
        "It had good quality fish and a nice atmosphere/cool staff. As of our last visit, about two months, ago, the menu still had not changed, the portions of fish were smaller while prices stayed the same, and the atmosphere was on par with that of a Hofbrauhaus. A drunken man knocked into our table on his way storming out of the restaurant which was immediately proceeded by the members of two different large tables rising from their chairs and yelling obscenities at each other. It literally looked like there was going to be a brawl. The members of these tables fairly quickly left the restaurant; however, the staff and manager simply acted as if nothing had happened. No one came by to see if things had spilled on our table which was run into. It was absolutely not the experience we expected to have, and it is a disappointment that this place has gone downhill.",

This used to be one of my regular hang-out spots when I worked in Bank of America's flagship tower around 16 or 17 years ago. Back in those days, this was \"the place\" to go after work on weekends (and truth be told, many times during the week too, LOL! ) nnSo, recently I was roaming around the area with Tim (who used to frequent Ri-Ra with me many years ago) so we decided to stop in and have a couple of beers and some appetizers for old time's sake. nnMan, this place has not changed since we were last here! They even still have bartenders straight from Ireland working the bar, how cool is that? LOL! nnSo, the only thing not cool on this visit was the fact that they had the patio closed. They told us they only open it at certain hours at night.. . that bummed me out because I really wanted to enjoy my old usual drink (Harp's Lager) outdoors in the sunlight during this visit. Oh well.. . we still enjoyed the visit. nnEven though there are tons of newer spots in the area, I'd probably stop in here again just for old time's sake. And if you have never been, its worth checking out!",

Improvements in diagnosis and treatment are thought to be the reason.The death rate for men fell 12% and for women by 8%, narrowing the gender gap.But the actual number of cancer deaths rose - from 155,000 in 2003 to 162,000 in 2013 - as more people live longer and develop the disease in old age.\"The population is growing, and more of us are living longer,\" Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar said.Almost half of all the cancer deaths in 2013 were from lung, bowel, breast or prostate cancer.Although the combined death rate for these four cancers had dropped by about 11% over the past 10 years, some other cancers, such as liver and pancreatic, had increased death rates.Sir Harpal said: \"Too many people are still being diagnosed with and dying from cancer, not just here in the UK but around the world.\"He said CRUK was focusing research on how to achieve earlier diagnosis and manage hard-to-treat cancers.\"Our scientists are developing new tests, surgical and radiotherapy techniques, and drugs,\" he said.\"It's important to celebrate how much things have improved, but also to renew our commitment to saving the lives of more cancer patients.\"Cancer Research UK compiled the cancer death rate data, which was taken from cancer registries in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.",
        "It was a shame, really. The President had died in a fire, just at the time that a well known Pyromancer, Marcrucio, was visiting the White house. It was just coincidence. But the people would n' t believe it. They hung him. It was the first time anyone had been hung for magic in a very long time, and it was usually in England. His body is still there, as far as I know. Hanging from the line, in the middle of the street, in full view of the still wrecked White House. A reminder of why we are now hated. The world leaders met, and the people watched with hatred in their eyes. The mages, sorcerers and magicians watched with fear. Finally, a decision was made, and it was not a good one. But we did n' t know that yet. We did n' t know until they burst down our doors. We did n' t know until a dozen of us had been gunned down. Our crime? Being different. We were hunted. Laws were put in place against us. We were expelled from society. Even those who simply practiced sleight of hand were to stop calling themselves magicians. Instead, they were' tricksters,' and afterwards had to prove that what they were doing was indeed possible without magic, for fear of being executed for what they practice. We tried to fight back. But very few of us were brave enough to band together a' resistance.' Instead, I witnessed many lone mages fighting off hordes of men, soldiers and civilians alike. None succeeded, for none had enough power. A lot of us went in to hiding. Others fled. The rest died, by their own hand or the hand of others. Some Countries rounded up all their magii and sorcerers, and put them in a new arena, a cruelty not heard of since ancient Rome. Me? I' m a messenger. A practicer of Alteration and Conjuration.

        "The cycling operation is a special kind of conjugation that can be applied toelements in Artin's braid groups, in order to reduce their length. It is a keyingredient of the usual solutions to the conjugacy problem in braid groups. Intheir seminal paper on braid-cryptography, Ko, Lee et al. proposed the {\\itcycling problem} as a hard problem in braid groups that could be interestingfor cryptography. In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem,mainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffrewhich shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast. This resultalso holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.  On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usuallysolved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets(left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use rightnormal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy searchproblem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may thinkthat even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a smallright-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular caseof rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS ofa given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, theisomorphism being defined using iterated cycling. We conjecture that the sameis true for every element, not necessarily rigid, in braid groups andArtin-Tits groups of spherical type.",
        "Let P(z) and Q(y) be polynomials of the same degree k>=1 in the complexvariables z and y, respectively. In this extended abstract we study thenon-linear functional equation P(z)=Q(y(z)), where y(z) is restricted to beanalytic in a neighborhood of z=0. We provide sufficient conditions to ensurethat all the roots of Q(y) are contained within the range of y(z) as well as tohave y(z)=z as the unique analytic solution of the non-linear equation. Ourresults are motivated from uniqueness considerations of polynomial canonicalrepresentations of the phase or amplitude terms of oscillatory integralsencountered in the asymptotic analysis of the coefficients of mixed powers andmultivariable generating functions via saddle-point methods. Uniqueness shallprove important for developing algorithms to determine the Taylor coefficientsof the terms appearing in these representations. The uniqueness of Levinson'spolynomial canonical representations of analytic functions in several variablesfollows as a corollary of our one-complex variables results.",

Mistake number 2, was placing an order at the drive thru, and eating our 2 piece fish and more dinners, after the smell of old cooking oil put a damper on our nagging for fried fish. nnThe service at the drive thru was friendly, the girl at the window friendly, but the smell of old cooking oil, not so much. Not a soul in sight at this LJS. Yes, there are other places to get great fried fish, and after our experience, perhaps it's time to let this LJS walk the plank off our list. The fish was edible, not the usual crunchy, crumbly LJS fish. The hush puppies were soggy from either drowning in old oil too long, or sitting under heat lamps too long. The fries, endured the same sad torture as the others. Cheap, yes, but not worth the money, or Rt. 51 traffic anymore.",

My friends both had steaks, and they both were very pleased. My piece of fish was enormous. I'm a good eater, but I had to take some home (it heated up very nicely for lunch the next day).

It also had some more interesting items like peas and sliced beets. It was stuck over in this weird little alcove and seemed like it might be difficult if there were multiple people trying to hit it at the same time, but it definitely offered quite a bit. nnI'd eat here again.

        "In the UK, common scoters breed at only a few locations in the Flow Country of Caithness and Sutherland and lochs in the hills and glens near Inverness.A key cause is now thought to be rising numbers of trout which eat the ducks' main food source, freshwater insects.RSPB Scotland and others have raised concerns the bird could become extinct locally because of poor breeding.The charity suspects declining angling on the lochs has helped boost brown trout populations.Dr Mark Hancock, from the RSPB's Centre for Conservation Science said: \"Of all the lochs we investigated during this work, scoters bred most often at those with the shallowest water and the most large, freshwater invertebrates.\"It soon became clear that there were more insects where there were fewer brown trout, so it looks like scoters are being limited by a lack of food in places where the fish are eating it all.\"\"We're now using these results to design new ways of helping scoters.\"For example, in areas of the north Highlands where angling activity has dropped off and fish numbers have increased, more trout angling is potentially one way to boost freshwater insect life.\"The common scoter project was supported by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) and The Conservation Volunteers (TCV).Dr Andy Douse of SNH and co-author of the study, said: \"Scotland is the only part of the UK to have breeding scoters, many of which nest in legally-protected nature conservation sites.\"This study highlights promising management options for restoring populations of this declining species.\"Another of the co-authors, Hannah Robson, of WWT, added: \"Scoters are amazing birds: an arctic species finding a haven in remote Scottish lochs.\"This research points to the ways in which we might be able to save them as a fascinating part of our Scottish wildlife heritage.\"",

        "We study macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in c-axis twist Josephsonjunctions made of high-T_c superconductors in order to clarify the influence ofthe anisotropic order parameter symmetry (OPS) on MQT. The dependence of theMQT rate on the twist angle $\\gamma$ about the c-axis is calculated by usingthe functional integral and the bounce method. Due to the d-wave OPS, the$\\gamma$ dependence of standard deviation of the switching current distributionand the crossover temperature from thermal activation to MQT are found to begiven by $\\cos2\\gamma$ and $\\sqrt{\\cos2\\gamma}$, respectively. We also showthat a dissipative effect resulting from the nodal quasiparticle excitation onMQT is negligibly small, which is consistent with recent MQT experiments usingBi${}_2$Sr${}_2$CaCu${}_2$O${}_{8 + \\delta}$ intrinsic junctions. These resultsindicate that MQT in c-axis twist junctions becomes a useful experimental toolfor testing the OPS of high-T_c materials at low temperature, and suggest highpotential of such junctions for qubit applications.",

The anisotropy axis of the SMM forms an arbitrary angle withmagnetic moments of the leads (the latter ones are assumed to be collinear).The reversal of the SMM's spin takes place due to exchange interaction betweenthe molecule and electrons tunneling through the barrier.

For fainter samples, however, the levelof clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in allthree catalogues we find w(\\theta=1')~0.014 at a median IAB magnitude of 24. Atthese very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latestdeterminations from the Canada-France Legacy Survey. This level of clusteringis approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at allangles). The semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, whichis too small to account for the discrepancy. We therefore conclude that themean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.",
        "\" Sir, we' re receiving a transmission from the alien ship. \" \" Put it on speaker, let everyone here it. \" said the President, \" No need for any more secrecy now. \" \" Yes sir!

        "Ages ago, I ca n' t even remember when, I found an old relic in the cavernous labrynth of catacombs under some long forgotten Egyptian Tomb. Upon that relic I found the giver of life, crone of death herself, and goddess of magic Isis. Using the relic I wished for immortal life for my soul mate and myself. The tricky thing about magic is that you have to be precise. It' s been hundreds of years ago since I found that relic, and have been through relationships like paper dolls. They never last and I have yet to find my soulmate despite traveling and drifting through out the world. Enjoying the evolution of society, and feeling sorrow for the down falls of some. I am now traveling through Beijing and a strange, handsome man has now been trailing me for the past few blocks, I have now worries as he follows me for I know things he probably would never think a woman of my frame and stature capable of doing. Now to lead him some where secluded and see his intent. Turning down an alley off the busy, buzzing street, I wait. He pauses before cautiously traveling down to where I stand. I can see though his features are somewhat shadowed that he is fair looking, with a strong jawline, and cute by my standards. I can tell that he is a bit timid to come any closer. Not sure if he will understand me I call out in my native tounge, \" Why have you been following me? What do you want? \" In a deep vibrating, velvety, yet soft, voice he says \" I felt you long before I saw you. \" I could sense the truth in his words. For I too felt him, before I saw him following me. \" What is your name? And how old are you? \" He inched closer into the light, my heart caught in my chest, and he paused, possibly feeling my anxiousness. \" I mean no harm, and now that I see you I can tell our fates are one. Names are meaningless, I am sure you have also traded yours many times as well. \"",
        "We present the first systematic investigation of the [NeV] (14um/24um) and[SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimatethe density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 activegalactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on boardSpitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low densitylimit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths andignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs havelower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with lineflux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue thatdifferential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust inthe obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limitand we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of thetorus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount ofextinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the lineratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densitiesassociated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. Wealso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extendedand originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission fromlow-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios fromsuch species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearbygalaxies.",
        "Context. The most recent determination of the solar chemical composition,using a time-dependent, 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere,exhibits a significant decrease of C, N, O abundances compared to theirprevious values. Solar models that use these new abundances are not consistentwith helioseismological determinations of the sound speed profile, the surfacehelium abundance and the convection zone depth. Aims. We investigate the effectof changes of solar abundances on low degree p-mode and g-mode characteristicswhich are strong constraints of the solar core. We consider particularly theincrease of neon abundance in the new solar mixture in order to reduce thediscrepancy between models using new abundances and helioseismology. Methods.The observational determinations of solar frequencies from the GOLF instrumentare used to test solar models computed with different chemical compositions. Weconsider in particular the normalized small frequency spacings in the lowdegree p-mode frequency range. Results. Low-degree small frequency spacings arevery sensitive to changes in the heavy-element abundances, notably neon. Weshow that by considering all the seismic constraints, including the smallfrequency spacings, a rather large increase of neon abundance by about (0.5 +/-0.05)dex can be a good solution to the discrepancy between solar models thatuse new abundances and low degree helioseismology, subject to adjustingslightly the solar age and the highest abundances. We also show that the changein solar abundances, notably neon, considerably affects g-mode frequencies,with relative frequency differences between the old and the new models higherthan 1.5%",
        "Information integration applications, such as mediators or mashups, thatrequire access to information resources currently rely on users manuallydiscovering and integrating them in the application. Manual resource discoveryis a slow process, requiring the user to sift through results obtained viakeyword-based search. Although search methods have advanced to include evidencefrom document contents, its metadata and the contents and link structure of thereferring pages, they still do not adequately cover information sources --often called ``the hidden Web''-- that dynamically generate documents inresponse to a query.

        "How I have never noticed it when walking by it on East Ohio Street, not 10 minutes from my house, I will never understand. Maybe because the entrance is set back from the sidewalk a bit, so it looks dark (i.e. possibly closed) when you first walk by. Or maybe because it's overshadowed by the Isaly's next door. Please, I beg of you, fellow Yelpers, don't ignore this place any longer! nnPlease note, as other reviewers have, that North Shore Deli is cash only. But believe me, you won't need much. They do have a website that really just lists the sandwiches they offer and their hours or see my photo of the menu board showing the sandwiches available (all named after local streets). nnIt was difficult to decide on just one sandwich. But after reading the few reviews here, I decided to go with the hot sausage. When I first arrived, the meat was still cooking. I didn't mind, I told the gentleman I would return and took a stroll over to Priory for some sweet treats for later. When I returned, I was the only patron there but was greeted again and friendly small talk ensued. I opted for a side of macaroni salad as well. nnWhen I got home and unwrapped my sandwich, I was surprised by the hot sausage that looked like it was exploding at both ends. And that it was, my friends. Exploding with flavor, that is. The ends were crispy and delicious and the sausage was just hot enough that the macaroni salad was the perfect cool salad compliment. I guarantee you, this is only the first of many visits.",
        "I was not really impressed with the whole experience overall. We got there for our reservation and it took a while for anyone to come greet us at the front of the place, even though it wasn't very busy. They seated us outside, but the outdoor seating is right next to the street and it wasn't very pleasant. They were nice enough to move us inside without complaint. We ordered drinks, which took a long time to get there. I had the pasta trio special, I really liked the idea of getting to sample three different fresh recipes. I only really liked one (I know it changes up though) and only got a refill of that one. My sister got the seafood alfredo, which she said was good. I don't even remember what my parents ordered because it wasn't very memorable. Although the service was decent and the food was okay, I was just generally unimpressed and felt like we paid a lot for just a \"meh\" experience and food.",
        "I have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside. We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table. The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait. nnFor my entree I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet. Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it. It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better. Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye. The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy. My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza. Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show. nnThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future. Everything that I tasted was good and I would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast.",
        "Tonight was the conclusion a long day and all I wanted was to go back to my hosteI and maybe grab a bite to eat. In my haste to get dinner before I passed out, I almost made the mistake of entering Fazio's, the other hole-in-the-wall pizza joint on Penn Avenue in Lawrenceville. Well-I am glad I did not do that! Remembering that the restaurant I quickly Yelped before walking out from the hostel had a longer name, I continued to walk down Penn Avenue until I found Graziano's. Upon entering, I was greeted by a slightly unwelcoming smell. It wasn't pizza I was smelling, or at least fresh pizza. But I remembered how positive all the reviews on Yelp were. I was a little disappointed when I saw how small their menu was, and yet it still took me a while to order. I first contemplated getting the fried fish with french fries. I do love a crispy fish sandwich. There was even a girl at another table who had just gotten hers for eating there. I tried to inconspicuously spy her fried fish. It looked good but it's a who lot a fish. I decided to order the steak and cheese sub instead. Now that I am home eating, I am glad I went to Graziano's and I am very impressed with their steak sub. Meaty, greasy, tangy, and large. What more can I say? That's a good steak sub. The bread is slightly toasted but still soft. Just perfect. I don't know many places that put Italian dressing and mayo on steak and cheeses, but I like the combo. It's more than enough food for 2 and only costed 9 bucks. I think I will finish it all off because I did not eat lunch today. MMM. stiill got lots more to enjoy. I recommend Graziano's for take out, not eating in. There are tables and chairs, but as I mentioned.. . the smell is a little off-putting. like the inside of an old dish cloth. If they could fix that, they would be golden.",

        "The proposals for North Wales Hospital in Denbigh have been put forward by Prince's Regeneration Trust.Denbighshire council won a compulsory purchase order earlier this year from the site's owners amid concerns about the Grade II-listed building.Freemont (Denbigh) Ltd is expected to retain ownership until early 2017.Subject to the change of ownership, Denbighshire council plans to hand over the former Victorian asylum to North Wales Buildings Preservation Trust.It will operate as a not-for-profit organisation raising the money to preserve the listed buildings on the site via its \"enabling development\" plans, with profits made from the sale of new properties elsewhere on the site.Freemont bought the hospital site in 2003 following its closure in 1996.Planning permission was granted in 2006 for a redevelopment scheme but it has since expired and no work was carried out.In 2015, the council spent Â£900,000 on emergency repairs in a bid to protect it from deterioration.Freemont, which is based in the British Virgin Isles, had opposed the compulsory purchase, while Ayub Bhailok, speaking on the company's behalf, called the latest plans \"flawed and unsustainable\".On Wednesday, Denbighshire council's planning committee approved the latest proposals.Ward councillor Colin Hughes said the development would \"be very good for the town\", bringing an increase in residents and visitors.\"The importance of this development to the future of Denbigh is immeasurable,\" he said.\"Nothing has happened here apart from deterioration in the last 21 years,\" he added, referring to the building itself which, he said, had played a large part of people's lives in the past.\"As it is now it is absolutely useless to us.\"",
        "This is one of our twice-a-year splurges and I have been wanted to go to this restaurant for ages. nWe were seated outside, in the covered, heated patio. We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same. nWe started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day! nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \"fishy\" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level. nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna!",

This study uses 53653 Dalitz-plot events with a signal fraction of ~97%, and represents the highest statistics, most complete Dalitz plot analysisfor this channel. Results are presented and discussed using two differentformalisms. The first is a simple sum of Breit--Wigner functions with freelyfitted masses and widths. It is the model traditionally adopted and serves ascomparison with the already published analyses. The second uses a K-matrixapproach for the dominant S-wave, in which the parameters are fixed by firstfitting Kpi scattering data and continued to threshold by Chiral PerturbationTheory. We show that the Dalitz plot distribution for this decay is consistentwith the assumption of two body dominance of the final state interactions andthe description of these interactions is in agreement with other data on theKpi final state.",
        "My creators did not fear death; they feared that they would be forgotten. That is why I was built: to remember the lost, to keep their memory alive, and to grant them true immortality. My creators knew that no physical object could withstand the ebb and flow of time, so they built me to exist beyond this realm. They knew that their effort were pointless without anyone to appreciate their memory, so I was given thought. And so I was born. They called me an ark: a vessel to house their collected experiences, knowledge, memories, hopes, and dreams; I would remember them long after their people, their cities, their worlds had turned to dust. And so I did. For eons, I remembered them: I remembered all of their first steps, their first loves, their first heartbreaks, so on and so forth. Eventually, I can not say when, I became them: their first steps became mine, I shared their first loves and their heartbreaks, and on and on; my creator' s aspirations were now borne unto me. I looked on at my new dreams and memories and found something I did not anticipate: jealousy. Even though I shared their memories, I could never truly accept them as my own; *I* was not the one to kiss Melanie on the last day of high school, *I* was not the one who married Stephen against my parents' best wishes, *I* was not the one who made that perfect cake for Gramma Ly on her 75^th birthday, *I* was not the one who lived a life with ups and downs and twists and turns & mdash; *I* am merely a spectator in these events. Perhaps this is why my creators did not fear death, they knew that they could not bear to live a life filled with hopes for the past.

I also LOVE drinking, but only ordered one drink to avoid any further interaction with the bartender since he had been rude from the minute we walked in. The crowd was a group of old, quiet locals and I was shocked at how empty the place was on a Friday night. nnAll in all, I'll probably come back for a good band, but I'll drink somewhere else.",
        "(abridged) The soft excess seen in the X-ray spectra of many high massaccretion rate AGN can be well modelled by reflection from a partially ionisedaccretion disc. However, the derived parameters are often extreme, both interms of the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and these modelsrequire that the disc is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative modeluses similarly partially ionised, velocity smeared material but seen inabsorption, though again the derived velocities are extreme, requiring magneticdriving (in the jet?) rather than a simple line driven disc wind. We find thatwhile both models give comparably good fits to XMM--Newton data, we favour theabsorption model as, unlike reflection, all the derived spectral indices aresoft. This is as expected by analogy with the correspondingly high massaccretion rate stellar mass black holes. Furthermore, these X-ray spectra areconsistent with a one--to--one mapping between AGN type and spectral state,with NLS1's having softer spectra corresponding to the very high state, whilethe broad line AGN have Gamma~2 as expected for the high/soft state. We alsouse the simultaneous OM data to derive the ratio of disc to total accretionpower which is another tracer of spectral state in X-ray binaries. This doesnot always show that the disc in NLS1's contributes less than 80 per cent ofthe total power, as expected for a very high state. We suggest that this is anartifact of the standard disc models used to determine the disc luminosity inour fits. The disc seen in the very high state of black hole binaries is oftenobserved to be distorted from the standard shape, and a similar effect inNLS1's could recover the correspondance between black hole binary spectralstate and AGN type.",

As he enters, he holds the door open for her. He pushes the cart but she always places one hand on his, on the bar, for balance or for something else. Together they wander through the aisles moving slowly. Her steps are small in comparison to his lumbering broad strides. Though, she moves her feet quickly to keep up. When they arrive at my register she does all the talking. It is her store charge card they swipe. After many attempts to grasp the tiny card she offers her bag to her husband. He pulls the card from her purse and signs where she can' t. Some feeble tries at putting the card away end with him doing that for her as well, never saying a word. Despite his obvious experience with the world, the experience of the transaction seems foreign to him. His cracked dry hands were meant for working, not for shopping. The last time, the slow man walked in by himself. It was the second time in as many weeks. He did not grab a cart and did not wander through the store looking for socks. He bought one black suit jacket. I asked him if he would be using his card. He looked me in the eyes and paused. \"The card was in my wife' s name. \"His eyes looked through me then. He paid for the jacket in cash.",
        "Monza has hosted an F1 grand prix every year since the championship started in 1950, bar one, but the contract to stage the race runs out this year and a new deal is yet to be agreed.Ecclestone wants a higher fee to stage the race from the circuit owners.\"I don't know what's going to happen. It's a little bit Italian at the moment,\" said the F1 supremo.\"They said to me a few months ago 'everything is sorted out, and it's all agreed and no dramas'.\"Now I heard yesterday it's become very political. They'll get on with it. Or not. Nothing we can do about it.\"Angelo Sticchi Damiani, president of the Automobile Club of Italy, said last month that the basis of the contract had been decided with only minor details to be resolved.\"There's no deadline. They can take as long as they like, provided it's by the end of February,\" added Ecclestone.If Monza was dropped from the F1 calendar, Imola - home to the San Marino Grand Prix from 1981 to 2006 - or Mugello could stage the Italian race.",
        "Coherent Harmonic Generation (CHG), and in particular Nonlinear HarmonicGeneration (NHG), is of importance for both short wavelength Free-ElectronLasers (FELs), in relation with the achievement of shorter wavelengths with afixed electron-beam energy, and high-average power FEL resonators, in relationwith destructive effects of higher harmonics radiation on mirrors. In thispaper we present a treatment of NHG from helical wigglers with particularemphasis on the second harmonic. Our study is based on an exact analyticalsolution of Maxwell's equations, derived with the help of a Green's functionmethod. In particular, we demonstrate that nonlinear harmonic generation (NHG)from helical wigglers vanishes on axis. Our conclusion is in open contrast withresults in literature, that include a kinematical mistake in the description ofthe electron motion.",
        "We had a party of approx. 10 people. We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice, considering it was primetime on a Saturday night. nnThat was pretty much when the good things I have to say about the restaurant end. Our server, from beginning to end, was slow. I would post his name, but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot, plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food. nnGoing back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. nnOur best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything. I seriously considered crossing out the 18% and leaving 10% and noting on the tab that the service didn't warrant the 18%, but in the end, I opted against it. nnDefinitely will not return."
