By resorting to DNA testing, authorities could establish a reliable and indisputable connection between the evidence left behind and the specific dog owner responsible.While critics argue that this method may appear extreme or invasive, proponents assert that it is a necessary step to promote responsible pet ownership and enhance the overall cleanliness of the town. Dog owners, too, have expressed varied reactions, with some embracing the measure as a means to distinguish themselves from negligent owners.If enacted, dog owners within the town may be required to register their pets' DNA, which would then be compared to samples of stray feces discovered on the streets. Matching results would enable the authorities to identify offenders and impose appropriate penalties, such as fines or mandatory attendance at pet responsibility courses.Although the utilization of DNA testing for this purpose is a relatively new concept, similar initiatives have been successfully implemented in other parts of the world, resulting in significant reductions in dog waste pollution. If adopted, this approach could serve as a model for other communities grappling with similar challenges.",

As he entered the chamber, some Labour MPs were seen to remain seated and silent, while others appeared to only offer muted applause.The lack of enthusiasm from some Labour MPs was in stark contrast to the reception given to May, who received a much warmer welcome from her own party.It is not the first time that Corbyn has been accused of lacking the support of his own MPs. Earlier this year, a number of Labour MPs resigned from his shadow cabinet in protest at his leadership.The latest incident is likely to further damage Corbyn's standing within the Labour Party and will add to the pressure on him to resign.Some commentators have suggested that the Labour MPs who refused to cheer Corbyn may have been motivated by a desire to see him replaced as leader.Others have suggested that the incident was simply a reflection of the deep divisions within the Labour Party over Brexit.Whatever the reason, the lack of support for Corbyn from some of his own MPs is a serious blow to his authority and will make it even more difficult for him to lead the party effectively.It remains to be seen whether Corbyn will be able to weather this latest storm and continue as Labour leader.",

        "Here is a 10 sentence news article for the given summary:The man seen as Chancellor Angela Merkel's main rival in the German election - Social Democrat Peer Steinbrueck - has sparked heated debate by giving a rude gesture. Steinbrueck, who is leading his party's campaign to unseat Merkel in the September elections, was photographed flipping his middle finger during a boat tour. The photo showed Steinbrueck on a boat smiling and holding his hand with his middle finger raised. His opponents have strongly condemned the gesture, calling it unacceptable behavior for a potential leader of Germany. Steinbrueck has since apologized, saying he made the rude sign spontaneously during the tour and did not intend any offense with it. However, members of Merkel's Christian Democrats said the gesture showed Steinbrueck lacked dignity and judgment necessary in a chancellor.

The rude photo threatens to damage Steinbrueck's chances in the upcoming election and give Merkel's party more ammunition against their rival. Many Germans are still debating whether Steinbrueck's apologies are sufficient or if he has compromised his candidacy through the impulsive gesture.",
