        "Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are all set to reprise the roles they first played two decades ago.An online trailer with footage from the original movie sets a release date of 27 January 2017.Trainspotting is based on Irvine Welsh's tale of Edinburgh drug addicts.The trailer comes as filming of T2 is getting under way, with Bremner spotted in character as Daniel \"Spud\" Murphy during pre-production in Edinburgh last week.Carlyle, who will return to the part of \"psycho\" Begbie, has said that the script for the new film is \"absolutely fantastic\" and stronger than the first film.The actor joined Welsh at The Usher Hall in Edinburgh earlier this year to mark 20 years since the release of the original movie, where he said that filming will take place \"pretty much 50-50\" between Edinburgh and Glasgow.He said: \"I'm basing this on nothing other than the fact that the production office is on Bathgate. There's a clue there.\"What I will say is that all the characters are exactly where you would want them to be.\"The strength of this new script is the fact that the narrative is a bit stronger than it was in the original.\"He added: \"You learn a lot about Renton, Sick Boy and indeed Begbie and where their heads are.\"I think it's an absolutely fantastic script. John Hodge has done a wonderful job, as he did with the original.\"McGregor has said he does not have any nerves about returning to the part of Renton.Speaking to the Press Association ahead of the release of his new movie Our Kind Of Traitor, he said: \"It's such an amazing script, penned by John Hodge who wrote the original Trainspotting script, so there's a real excitement about it.\"Like every movie you do, you have things to think about leading up to them. There is a nervousness about it, but I'm not nervous because it's a sequel to Trainspotting.\"",
        "The authority said it would also make £27m of cuts to adult social care and £6.7m in children's services and education under initial proposals.The Labour-run council is also planning to axe school crossing patrols, cut back on early years speech therapy and increase council tax by 4% a year.It said it would face a budget gap of between £40m and £75m.Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, said: \"Manchester remains an ambitious city and this will be ambitious budget which will nevertheless involve some difficult decisions.\"We have to do services fundamentally differently to the way we do [them] now.\"He said devolution, which gave the city \"greater autonomy\" in areas such as health and social care, would help it to make the changes by placing \"greater emphasis on prevention of problems, not spending fortunes on tackling them reactively\".\"In particular, we have to give people more support early on, more support in the communities they live in, rather than admitting them unnecessarily in hospital like we do now.He added: \"These are options and no decisions about specific proposals are being taken until the New Year.\"Manchester's sole opposition councillor, Liberal Democrat John Leech, said people would be \"understandably shocked and frustrated\" at the job losses just weeks after a number of senior managers were awarded above-inflationary pay rises.\"Whilst I accept the cuts to Manchester are tough, there seems to be little attempt to lessen the blow on local residents and frontline services.\"Consultation on the proposals will begin next month.The authority said its resources had reduced from £682m a year in 2010/11 to about £528m a year, with a 40% reduction in the workforce.",
        "Original stars Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Ewan Bremner and Robert Carlyle are all returning for the new film.Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Boyle confirmed that the shoot was planned for \"May/June\".The film, loosely based on Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting follow-up Porno, could be released later next year.Boyle said filming of the sequel might be as tight as the first, which was shot in less than two months.Miller and Carlyle both star in US TV shows -  CBS's Elementary and ABC's Once Upon a Time respectively.\"They only get this little window off, so either you wait for the contract to run down, which could be as late as three years, or you kind of try and do it in this window,\" Boyle said.\"But all four lads are back in.\"The original Trainspotting was made on a shoestring budget of just Â£1.5m.The sequel's budget will be bigger but still relatively modest.\"We're doing it for less than $20m, and that'll give us control of the film so we can make the film we want to make,\" Boyle told the Hollywood Reporter.\"That's as much as you can get without being answerable to anybody. You can sort of get on with it without much interference. Although we could have raised a lot more money for this, we didn't, so we're trying to keep some sense like we kept the original.\"Boyle is hoping Film4, who produced the original, will get on board.He admitted there were reservations among the cast about making a sequel.\"The actors were understandably worried about its reputation and not wanting to let people down or to just be cashing in,\" he said.\"So actually the script, which John (Hodge) has written, has been put under a very fierce spotlight by everyone, and it's a good one.\"Everyone's attitude is that it'll be an honourable addition and an interesting addition to the original film. We're very positive that we believe it can happen and it's coming true.\"",
        "Lifeguards discovered broken bottles, the remains of barbecue and damage to Whiterocks unit's radio aerial on Wednesday morning.A large rock which had been thrown at the hut left a two inch hole in the unit which had also been covered with indecent graffiti.The RNLI estimated that repairs will cost £800.The vandalism follows two of the busiest days on Northern Ireland's beaches this summer.RNLI Lifeguard Supervisor Karl O'Neill said the damage to the aerial mount had threatened vital VHF communications while the rock damage meant the unit was no longer watertight.He said: \"Our lifeguards rely on the aerial to communicate with each other when on patrol and to communicate with their colleagues in the Coastguard in the event of an emergency.\"Thankfully the damage has not rendered our communications off-service but should it have and should it have happened during the last two days which brought thousands of people to our beaches to enjoy the good weather, lives could have been put at risk.\"It is very disappointing for our lifeguards, who have been working hard to keep people safe, to turn up this morning after two busy days and see the unit they need to carry out their job has been so badly damaged, it really does dampen spirits.\"Our lifeguards' primary role at Whiterocks and on all lifeguarded beaches on the Causeway Coast is to make sure the beach can be enjoyed safely by the public. We want them to be able to continue to do that safely and with peace of mind,\" he added.",

I am maybe thinking about it more now and willing people to find the edge,\" Read said.\"I probably won't do a lot. I will probably throw the ball up a little bit higher than I might normally do,\" he told BBC Radio Nottingham.\"But, at the same time, I am so excited by this group of bowlers. The way Jake Ball bowled against Warwickshire was brilliant.\"If he keeps that up I am sure there will be more edges coming my way.\"Read's chance to become the 26th player in history to reach 1,000 dismissals will come when Notts start a Championship game against Durham at Trent Bridge on 9 September.The former England keeper, who missed part of the season with a hamstring injury, is currently leading Nottinghamshire's batting averages, with 762 runs in 16 innings at an average of 63.50.And he reached a milestone with the bat this week, when his 69 against Warwickshire saw him pass 15,000 first-class runs.Read, who has three centuries this season, added: \"I didn't feel it was a big thing but everyone was 'yeah, that's a lot of runs'.\"For me, we talk about landmarks, but that wasn't one I was eyeing up at all.\"I am in really good form at the moment and I have always said that when you are in form, you need to make it pay.\"There are times in your career when you have lows, you don't know where your next run is coming from, so you really need to make those times count.\"",

        "Lenders reported that this was the third successive quarter of falling demand, the bank's Credit Conditions Survey found.Mortgages for high-value property saw the biggest fall in demand since the third quarter of 2008.Demand was expected to bounce back in the second quarter.Some lenders attributed the fall in demand over recent quarters to a combination of changes in regulatory policy and concerns about housing affordability, as well as uncertainty about the outlook for the housing market.However, the predicted recovery might point to the effect of the general election campaign on the UK housing market.\"For demand to have fallen particularly sharply at the upper end of the market underlines the sensitivity of this demographic to political uncertainty,\" said Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of Dragonfly Property Finance.\"Many prime and super-prime buyers are sitting on their hands and want to see what the next government looks like before they commit to a purchase. That this is the most uncertain election in decades has certainly triggered more caution at this level of the market than normal.\"The survey suggested that lenders were showing a greater willingness to lend to borrowers who were only able to offer a deposit of less than 10% of the property's value so far this year. Many of these borrowers would be first-time buyers.",

        "The skeleton belongs to a small, plant-eating dinosaur which lived 200 million years ago - at the beginning of the Jurassic Period.Although this species was widespread at the time, scientists have largely had to rely on incomplete fossils.The analysis was carried out at the ESRF facility in Grenoble, France, and showed that the specimen was juvenile.The skeleton is too small and fragile, and the rocks around it too hard, to allow it to be studied by conventional means.In addition, the rock matrix in which the fossil is preserved contains trapped minerals which prevented it from being scanned in a standard CT scanner.The specimen was discovered in a stream bed on a farm in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa by palaeontologist Billy de Klerk.\"There's still a lot we don't know about early plant-eating dinosaurs,\" said Prof Jonah Choiniere from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.\"We need new specimens like this one and new technology like the synchrotron to fill in those gaps.\"Prof Choiniere, along with Dr Vincent Fernandez, from the ESRF (European Synchrotron), scanned the specimen with high-powered X-rays to understand how the species, Heterodontosaurus tucki, ate, moved, and breathed.Scanning the fist-sized skull might allow the scientists to perform a 3D reconstruction of the animal's brain, offering insights into its lifestyle - including its sense of smell, and whether it was capable of complex behaviours.The scientists think the diminutive dinosaur used its back teeth to grind down plant food. In other animals with similar anatomy, this requires the teeth to be replaced due to wear and tear.The team members said they can now begin testing this theory and others regarding the dinosaur's biology and behaviour.Follow Paul on Twitter.",

So many elite coaches are male and it's hard for them to understand.\"It's this big taboo. I found that awareness is so poor and people don't know anything about it.\"By doing this research, we hope to raise more awareness and to encourage further examination of the subject.\"Bruinvels is using crowdfunding to aid the next stage of her research, which will focus on heavy menstrual bleeding and the possible increase of iron deficiency.",

        "Deputy leader Amelia Womack said the proposed increase would be \"life changing\" for families.The Greens are also pledging to reverse cuts to welfare as part of efforts to \"protect the most vulnerable\".The pledges, announced as the party unveiled its campaign bus in Bristol, would be paid for by increasing tax for the wealthiest, Ms Womack said.This election issue includes access to benefits (apart from pensions), poverty and inequality.Policy guide: Where the parties standChild benefit is a tax-free payment aimed at helping parents cope with the cost of bringing up children.Currently, one parent can claim £20.50 a week for an eldest or only child and £13.55 a week for each of their other children.The payments apply to all children aged under 16 and in some cases until they are 20 years old.\"We believe in doing more, much more, to redistribute income within our society,\" Ms Womack said.\"That's why we're being honest about the fact that we'd increase tax for the richest in society - and it's why we're able to pledge that we'd double child benefit to £40 a week.\"For the 29% of children here in Bristol West who live in poverty, this increase will be life changing.\"The party also wants to retain the Independent Living Fund that helps disabled people to live and work in the community, and which is due to close on 30 June 2015.\"We won't stand by while this lifeline is cut away,\" said Ms Womack, estimating that the policy would cost £300m.The deputy leader said the Greens would always stand for an economy that \"works for the many\", adding: \"That means our MPs will never blame the most vulnerable for the mistakes of those at the top.\"Subscribe to the BBC Election 2015 newsletter to get a round-up of the day's campaign news sent to your inbox every weekday afternoon.",

It's a reading day.\"Melania Trump has been cast as a different kind of first lady: an enigmatic figure who's kept a low profile. She's made few public appearances, and she wears dark sunglasses when she travels with her husband.On a recent trip they walked back to the airplane's press cabin, and she stayed silent while he joked with reporters. Her hospital visit was one of her first solo ventures as first lady: two cameramen and I travelled in her motorcade and watched her read to children.Afterwards I asked her about the hospital. She started to speak - but was pulled away and asked to pose for more photos. She's new to her role, but she may decide to raise her profile: just because she's quiet doesn't mean she has nothing to say.\"You go places where you feel better,\" she told the sick children.The first lady came from Trump Tower bearing a white box filled with Dr Seuss books bound with a golden ribbon.\"You'll be as famous as famous can be,\" she read, holding up the book to display the pictures, \"with the whole wide world watching you win on TV\".Seated in a wooden chair, Mrs Trump wore black stilettos and a large diamond ring as she read to the children.",

The last few days have been very hard for me. I have felt angry and isolated.\"I was being treated like a criminal. How could I be punished when I was the victim of racism?\"I hope my case can help so that other footballers do not suffer like me.\"Muntari was initially booked for dissent, then received a second yellow card for leaving the field.Serie A, although agreeing that the abuse Muntari received was \"deplorable\", originally said that it could not impose sanctions on Cagliari because \"approximately 10\" supporters were involved - fewer than 1% of their supporters in the ground.Ex-Tottenham striker Garth Crooks called on players in Italy to strike in protest against Muntari's punishment.Anti-discrimination organisation Kick It Out said the ruling was \"gutless\", while Crooks said: \"I'm calling on players in Italy, black and white, to make it absolutely clear to the federation in Italy that their position is unacceptable, and if the decision is not reversed then they withdraw their services until it is.\"The 32-year-old former Portsmouth and Sunderland player will now be available for Pescara's game at home to Crotone on Sunday.",

Russia made an advance payment of about €840m.The first of two - the Vladivostok - was supposed to be delivered to Russia in November 2014.Vladimir Kozhin, a military technology adviser to Mr Putin, said on Friday that negotiations over compensation were \"completely finished\".\"Everything has already been decided, both the time-frame and the amount,\" Mr Kozhin told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.But Mr Hollande's comments suggest that the agreement is still in question.Sources close to the talks, quoted by Russia's Kommersant daily, have suggested France will compensate Russia to the tune of €1.16bn.That sum includes the amount that Russia has already spent on special training for 400 sailors, on port infrastructure in Vladivostok for the two warships and on developing four prototype Ка-52К helicopters.The compensation deal was discussed last week at talks between Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and French Defence Secretary-General Louis Gautier, Kommersant reports.The Mistral contract dates back to a June 2011 agreement reached under the previous French President, Nicolas Sarkozy.Western sanctions have been ratcheted up against Russia since March 2014, when the Ukrainian conflict erupted with Russia's annexation of Crimea.Russia denies backing pro-Russian separatist rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine.",

Activists said minors were among those jailed. Four people were acquitted.Among the group's targets, the Gulf Daily News reported, were the Saudi embassy in Manama and the King Fahd Causeway connecting Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.The court alleged that those on trial were funded by the main Shia opposition group, al-Wefaq, and a banned association, al-Wafa (Fidelity).In a statement, two Bahrain advocacy groups said that nine of those found guilty were under the age of 18.\"Bahrain's politicised courts are disenfranchising an entire generation of Bahrainis with unfair imprisonment,\" said Husain Abdulla, of Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain.Bahrain was hit by an uprising in 2011 in which the Shia majority demanded democratic reforms from the Sunni-led government.

        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets.A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries.An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies.In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company.Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road.American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious.Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot).American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket.2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault.Pictures of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations led people to incorporate the term into film titles. Tom and Jerrrycan, Jerrycan Beauty and Catch Me If You Jerrycan were the result.Another obvious target was Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 film Drive which social media users changed to Walk and Drive Pas.Read more about France's controversial new labour laws",

The abuse from the travelling support directed at him in the recent draw with Rotherham was vociferous and I understand that his position was very much hanging in the balance from then on.Coyle can rightly claim that he wasn't backed in terms of budget. He was given £250,000 to spend in the summer while he recouped in excess of £10m and the January transfer window saw him frustrated that the club failed to land his list of potential targets.The fact that Rovers haven't been higher than 20th all season is the reason behind his departure. Financially they can ill afford relegation to League One, and whoever comes in has 15 games to save them.Since the takeover of the club by Venky's in November 2010, the club are now looking to appoint a seventh permanent manager.",

At the end of the day they should sit here, then they would understand.\"I'm not abusive, I'm polite, I'm only sat here, I'm not going out shoplifting or going and mugging people.\"But Ms Dallimore said support is available for those who want to tackle their addictions.She said: \"We have been working with not only the police but also with a lot of our charitable sector partners including Turning Point who help people with substance misuse issues.\"It's welcome news this individual wants help, and the public needs to report individuals they're coming across to us.\"",
        "The ruling was made after an agreement was reached between the Academy and Nate D Sanders, an auction house that specialises in movie memorabilia.The golden statuette in question was awarded in 1942 to Joseph C Wright for his colour art direction on My Gal Sal.His heirs sold the Oscar in June 2014.The Academy tried to prevent the sale, claiming it breached a rule, instituted in 1951, that Oscar winners and their heirs cannot sell statuettes without first offering it to the organisation for $10.The Academy's lawyers argued that Nate D Sanders was aware of the requirement when it bought the Oscar at a sale organised by Rhode Island firm Briarbrook Auctions.Nate B Sanders previously handled the auction of 15 Oscar statues, a collection whose sale fetched more than $3m (Â£1.9m), in 2012.\"The Oscar is perhaps the world's most distinctive and prestigious award for achievement in the arts,'' said Gary E Gans, the lawyer who represented the Academy in the protracted litigation.\"This case established that the Academy can maintain the dignity and value of such an award by keeping it from becoming a commodity.\"Last year the Academy took legal action against the heirs of another Oscar winner - cinematographer Robert Surtees - after they allegedly sold one of his awards on eBay.",

        "Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr spoke of such checks in an interview with the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). They could be like sports doping tests, the paper said.A Germanwings co-pilot deliberately crashed a plane in the Alps in March.It remains unclear why he did so.Andreas Lubitz, 27, is thought to have suffered some sort of mental breakdown. Prosecutors in Duesseldorf found evidence of \"an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment\". They found torn-up sick notes at his home.Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 - travelling from Barcelona to Duesseldorf - was flown into a mountain by Lubitz, after he locked the plane's pilot out of the cockpit. Germanwings is a budget airline managed by Lufthansa.In the FAZ interview, Mr Spohr said unannounced medical checks for pilots could be introduced, which in terms of the surprise factor would be similar to doping tests for sports men and women.He said that in certain cases a doctor might have to be released from the duty of confidentiality, to reveal concerns about a pilot.Random checks might for example detect a drug that the pilot had concealed from his or her employer.Since the disaster Lufthansa and other airlines have ruled that there must always be at least two people in the cockpit.Air accident investigators have staged a test flight to reconstruct conditions on board the Germanwings Airbus A320 which disintegrated on a mountainside in the French Alps after being put into a controlled dive.The German tabloid Bild says experts flew an identical plane, which took off from Hamburg and returned there after flying in German airspace. It took place on 12 May, a spokesman for Germany's crash investigation authority BFU said.French investigators say they hope the reconstruction will help them analyse sounds recorded in the cockpit of Flight 4U 9525. The flight copied the various altitudes, speeds, the cockpit door locking mechanism and pilots' breathing noises.",

The targets were not named.Mr Zahid said notes had also been found describing how to make bombs. The notes were written by an Indonesian executed for his role in the 2002 bomb attacks in Bali.Two of those arrested were members of the army.The new anti-terror laws have raised concern among human rights and opposition groups, who fear they may be used to stifle political dissent.The new Prevention of Terrorism Act would permit indefinite detention without trial.

        "Leigh Nairn said his drone was badly damaged in the incident at Binnu, 550km (340 miles) north of Perth.The drone, used to monitor barley-seeding equipment on his property, was sent off to be repaired.He said he was \"100% lucky\" that the drone managed to capture an image of the bird as it swooped.\"That's the only photo I have of it,\" he said.\"I'm not sure where it came from, but I was obviously in the wrong spot and [it] wanted to let me know that.\"The eagle flew off unscathed, he said.He said the species, Australia's largest bird of prey, sometimes attacked lambs on the 7,500-acre (3,000-hectare) farm.Despite being a nuisance the birds were \"fantastic to look at\", he said.\"They are protected, as they should be, but they do give you a lot of trouble during lambing season,\" Mr Nairn told the BBC.It is not uncommon for the species to take down drones. In November, an Australian mining company lost nine surveying drones to bird attacks at a total cost of more than A$100,000 (Â£60,000; $75,000).But in \"a low-tech solution to a high-tech problem\", Dutch police have trained eagles to take down unauthorised drones.",
        "The 28-year-old American became only the second player in history to average a triple-double for an entire season.He took the award over Houston Rockets guard James Harden and San Antonio Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard.Golden State forward Draymond Green was named the best defensive player after winning the NBA title.Westbrook has had a record-breaking season becoming the first player since Oscar Robertson in 1962 to average a triple-double across the season.He also set the new standard by recording 42 triple-doubles, one better than the former single-season mark set by Robertson.And he made NBA history scoring the highest ever triple-double with 57 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists against Orlando Magic.\"It was obviously an amazing season for me but without these guys and the rest of our guys that are not here, none of this would be possible,\" Westbrook said.\"So this award is not for me. This is for all you guys and I am very thankful to have you guys in my corner. You guys are my brothers for life.\"A triple-double means a player has recorded a double-digit number in three of five statistical categories - points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.Before the season critics had doubted whether Westbrook would continue to thrive following the departure of former MVP Kevin Durant - who left Thunder in the off-season.Durant went on to secure his first NBA title with Golden State, but despite the loss, Westbrook-led Thunder recorded 47 wins, just eight fewer than the previous campaign.Among the night's other recipients at the first-ever NBA Awards, Mike D'Antoni was named Coach of the Year after leading Houston to 55 wins in his first season.Milwaukee Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon was named Rookie of the Year, while Houston Rockets guard Eric Gordon earned the Sixth Man Award for his work off the bench as a substitute.",

        "But Ecowas leaders meeting in Liberia said the implications of its membership still needed to be considered before Morocco could formally join.King Mohammed VI was not at the summit because Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been invited.Morocco's application comes after it rejoined the African Union in January.Morocco left the continental body in 1984 after it recognised the independence of Western Sahara.Morocco regards Western Sahara as part of its historic territory and has spent much of the last three decades trying to strengthen ties with Europe at the expense of relations with Africa.Ivory Coast President Alasanne Ouattara has confirmed that the decision had been agreed in principle but the details still had to be worked out.Morocco, along with Tunisia which is seeking observer status with the organisation and Mauritania, which wants to return to the body, will be invited to the next meeting of heads of state in Togo in December, a senior Ecowas source told the BBC.Ecowas is made up of 15 West African nations, none of which shares a border with Morocco.Members enjoy free trade and movement of people.King Mohammed VI last week announced he would not be attending the summit in Liberia, because of the presence of Israel's prime minister.Morocco does not have diplomatic ties with Israel.Mr Netanyahu addressed West African leaders on Sunday saying: \"Israel is coming back to Africa and Africa is coming back to Israel.\"I believe in Africa.

It is leftovers like draff and pot ales - both produced in the early stages of the process.They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed.Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol - a direct replacement for vehicle fuel.Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent malt whisky producer Tullibardine have signed a memorandum of understanding.Together they will apply the process to thousands of tonnes of the distillery's leftovers.Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said: \"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two iconic Scottish industries - whisky and renewables.\"This project demonstrates that innovative use of existing technologies can utilise resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.\"Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends Â£250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said: \"We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this innovative venture, the obvious benefits of which are environmental.\"It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.\"The project is being supported by a grant from the Scottish government's Zero Waste Scotland initiative.Celtic Renewables said it eventually aimed to build a processing plant in Scotland, with the hope of building an industry that could be worth Â£60m a year.",

I've accepted the mistake. I spoke to the BBC reporter, who accepted my apology.\"The BBC confirmed that Moyes and Sparks had spoken about the exchange and the issue had been resolved.A spokesman said: \"Mr Moyes has apologised to our reporter and she has accepted his apology.\"However, shadow sports minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan called on the Football Association to get involved.\"This is disgraceful. David Moyes cannot get away with these sexist threats - the FA must take action immediately,\" she said.Former England striker and BBC Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker also condemned Moyes' behaviour.\"Moyes incident highlights a tendency for some managers to treat interviewers with utter disdain.

That was two million fewer than watched the opening instalment on Monday.The BBC apologised on Tuesday for \"issues with the sound levels\".The corporation's controller of drama commissioning, Ben Stephenson, later said the problem was partly down to the actors.\"Actors not being clear is obviously one part of it but my understanding about the complaints about Jamaica Inn was more complex than that,\" he said.\"I think it's probably not right to just single out that, but clearly we want actors to speak clearly. Of course we want them to give brilliant performances and you've got to respect that but if no-one can understand what they're saying then there is a problem.\"After the first episode was aired, the drama's screenwriter Emma Frost said it was \"like listening through mud\" and took to Twitter to blame a technical fault.In its statement on Tuesday, the BBC said sound levels on the second and third episodes would be adjusted before they were broadcast and apologised \"to those viewers who were affected\".But on Thursday, a BBC spokesperson said 1,384 complaints had been received since Wednesday, taking the total to 2,182.Jamaica Inn's problems follow similar complaints about dramas like Birdsong and Parade's End and a promise last year from the corporation's director general Tony Hall to address the issue of mumbling.\"I don't want to sound like a grumpy old man, but I also think muttering is something we could have a look at,\" Lord Hall said last July.\"Actors muttering can be testing - you find you have missed a line... you have to remember that you have an audience.\"",

Oxford and Cambridge Universities have one, as do Salisbury, Exeter and Durham cathedrals.The historical significance of the Bible was not highlighted in the parish records so it was stored in a cupboard at the back of the church.Mr Baker said: \"It was a really exciting thing to discover - it looks just like something out of Harry Potter.\"One of the wonderful things about worshipping in a church as old as ours is the sense of history that oozes from its walls and discovering the treasures it has to offer.\"But we were stunned to discover a treasure as rare as this. We knew as soon as we saw the date of the New Testament it was a significant find.\"Dr Jeremiah added: \"It's amazing to think we are able to hold a book printed as the direct result of the command of King James 400 years ago.\"\"This English language version of the Bible was created to encourage ordinary people to discover the Good News of Jesus Christ for themselves and it is likely that it was the book that first took God's word into many people's homes in this part of Lancashire.\"Now we hope to encourage the people of Lancashire and elsewhere to visit our church and discover this Bible for themselves.\"",

        "Work has also ended on versions of its software that was designed to run on smartphones and laptops.Ubuntu said it took the decision because the project had failed to win over users and industry partners.Instead, it said, it would concentrate on code for cloud services and internet-of-things devices.The Linux open source operating system exists in lots of different versions or \"distributions\" that share the same source code but often have a different interface laid on top. Unity aimed to be a graphical front-end suitable for lots of different devices.Canonical, which makes the popular Ubuntu distribution of the Linux open source software, started the Unity project in 2011. The ultimate idea was to produce software that ran on large and small devices and could be used the same way on all of them.The Unity project also aimed to let smartphones act as a desktop machine when combined with other devices such as docking stations.However, said Canonical boss Mark Shuttleworth in a blog, although Unity tried to end some of the fragmentation in the open source world it actually ended up contributing to it.In addition, he said, few people had bought phones or laptops that ran the Ubuntu/Unity combination and few laptop makers were offering the software as an option.Mr Shuttleworth said that Ubuntu would switch back to the default user interface for Linux - known as Gnome - in April 2018.He said the decision to end Unity had been \"very difficult\" because he believed strongly in ways to make it easier to use Linux anywhere and everywhere and because of the time he had spent with the developers working on it.\"We feel like a family, but this choice is shaped by commercial constraints and those two are hard to reconcile,\" he said.",

        "Erin Bisson, from Jersey, launched legal action for discrimination against Condor Ferries after a member of staff told her to use a disabled loo.She had also said the use of words rather than symbols on toilets amounted to indirect discrimination.The firm admitted discrimination at the island's Employment and Discrimination Tribunal on Friday.In its first decision taken since the island introduced gender discrimination laws in 2015, the tribunal found Ms Bisson's complaints against Condor of direct and indirect discrimination because of her gender reassignment to be \"well-founded\".When she called the company in September to ask which toilets she should use, Ms Bisson said a staff member \"advised me I should be using the disabled toilets\".She claimed this had amounted to direct discrimination.Condor, which sails between Poole, Portsmouth, France and the Channel Islands, admitted to a \"non-intentional and non-malicious act of discrimination\".Ms Bisson has since approved changes to the Condor toilets which now have symbols representing men and women, and not words. Male and female toilets are still separate.\"Gender is down to identity, symbols is one way of dealing with this\", she said.Condor Ferries said it had worked with Ms Bisson to draw up a list of measures \"to remove the possibility of inadvertent discrimination\", which it had implemented after approval from Ms Bisson and the tribunal.\"As the first ruling about transgender discrimination, this sets the direction for future tribunals to follow,\" said advocate Caroline Dutot, an employment and discrimination law specialist in Jersey.Condor Ferries said all its staff had also completed a diversity training programme for the first time in March.Vic Tanner Davy, chair of Trans* Jersey, said while the group was \"pleased\" the tribunal had found in favour of a transgender person, the community preferred \"the approach of education\" rather than \"litigation\" against employers.",

        "The lines on Sandygate Road were painted last year after the road was resurfaced.Sheffield City Council said the lines were introduced for safety reasons, including improving the safety of cyclists riding up the hill.The authority said the lines would be changed \"as soon as possible\".In a statement, Labour councillor Tony Downing said: \"Following the introduction of the new road markings last autumn, we listened to comments made by the public and agreed to carry out a Road Safety Audit on this part of the scheme instead of waiting until June when the whole scheme for the zone has been completed.\"The audit recommended that the central road markings should be restored.  There were issues mainly around vehicles parked on the downhill section of the road, visibility and the increased likelihood of opposing vehicles coming into conflict.\"Marie Biggs, who ran the campaign to have the lines re-painted, said she was \"very pleased\".She said: \"If it's not broken then why fix it? It worked perfectly well with the lines in the middle all the years that I've lived here, so why change it?\"",
        "Both teams ended with 10 men after Laurent Koscielny and Olexandr Kucher were sent off in stoppage time.But the damage had already been done as Roman Zozulya side-footed home after being put through by Edmar.Koscielny then conceded a penalty for bringing down Zozulya, allowing Andriy Yarmolenko to convert from the spot.The victory on home soil will give Ukraine, who have lost their previous three World Cup play-offs, confidence ahead of Tuesday's second leg in Paris.Ukraine's advantage also leaves Didier Deschamps's men facing the prospect of failing to qualify for a major tournament for the first time since the 1994 World Cup.Deschamps admitted before the match that his team faced a stern test in Kiev, with the hosts unbeaten in 10 games since Mikhail Fomenko became manager at the beginning of the year.Ukraine have also become adept at keeping clean sheets, with this their eighth clean sheet during Fomenko's tenure.With Franck Ribery closely marked, France barely troubled the Ukrainians, a volley from Samir Nasri after falling a goal behind the closest Les Bleus came to scoring.Edmar was the architect of the first goal, bisecting the French defence, and Zozulya held firm under desperate French defending to squeeze the ball home from six yards.Ukraine threatened to score a second and were rewarded with the penalty, while Yarmolenko converted. The evening got worse for Koscielny as he was shown a second yellow for raising his arms at Kucher.A perfect evening for the hosts was ruined when Kucher was then shown a second yellow two minutes later for a foul on Mathieu Valbuena.Deschamps said: \"Opening the scoring gave them more strength and we made a mistake on the penalty.\"It's obviously a very bad result. We have to believe [we can go through] but Ukraine are the team in the best position to qualify. We still have 90 minutes at home.\"",

        "A naval ship was forced to change course in order to avoid the cluster of buoyant rocks, located 1,000 miles off the New Zealand coast.The unusual phenomenon was probably the result of pumice being released from an underwater volcano, experts said.One navy officer described it as the \"weirdest thing\" he had seen at sea.Lieutenant Tim Oscar told the AFP news agency: \"As far ahead as I could observe was a raft of pumice moving up and down with the swell.\"The [top of the] rock looked to be sitting two feet above the surface of the waves and lit up a brilliant white colour. It looked exactly like the edge of an ice shelf,\" the officer said.Researchers aboard the ship, HMNZS Canterbury, suggest that the source of the pumice was an underwater volcano (seamount) known as Monowai, located to the north of New Zealand.The pumice is likely to have been formed when lava from the seamount came into contact with seawater, and as it is less dense than water it quickly rises to the surface of the ocean.Vicky Hards from the British Geological Survey said the raft of volcanic rocks on this scale was a \"relatively unusual occurrence\".\"Some 50-60 volcanic eruptions are reported per year in total, and out of these only a very small proportion are submarine,\" she told BBC News.\"Nevertheless, submarine volcanic eruptions are a relatively common phenomena, in fact many probably go unrecorded in the deep marine environment.Dr Hards added that a previous example was close to Tristan da Cunha, a small group of small volcanic islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean.\"A small eruption occurred in 2004 and rafts of pumice were observed about a mile offshore, washing up on the beaches for the next weeks\" she explained.",

        "A couple and a baby were rescued and taken to hospital on Saturday but hopes of finding more survivors are fading.The bodies of fifteen people have so far been recovered, but many more are feared trapped beneath the rubble.Thousands of rescuers were deployed after some 40 homes were destroyed in Xinmo village in Maoxian county.Emergency workers have been digging through earth and rocks for a second day, with rescue dogs scouring the debris for some 118 people who remain unaccounted for.One of those rescued, Qiao Dashuai, told state broadcaster CCTV that his baby had woken him and his partner in the early hours, adding that when the couple opened the door of their home they were swept away by water. He said his parents and other relatives were still missing.Heavy rain is thought to have triggered the landslide, causing the top section of a mountain to loosen, sending boulders and rocks crashing down onto the village below at about 06:00 local time on Saturday (22:00 GMT on Friday).Chinese President Xi Jinping later urged the emergency services to \"spare no effort\".More than 3,000 rescuers have been working in the area, using ropes to move large rocks in the frantic search for villagers.But geological experts at the site on Sunday said that the chance of finding survivors was becoming \"really slim\", China's Xinhua news agency reports.The landslide blocked a 2km (1.2-mile) stretch of a river, the news agency added. Local police said a lack of vegetation in the area had made the landslide worse.Local officials said some 8m cubic metres (282m cubic ft) of rock had been dislodged and roads had been closed to all traffic except emergency services.Landslides are a regular danger in mountainous regions of China, especially during heavy rains.In 2008, 87,000 people were killed when an earthquake struck Wenchuan county in Sichuan province.

        "A negotiator for the rebels at peace talks in Havana, Victoria Sandino, read out a statement saying they would no longer recruit anyone under 18.The Farc last year said it would stop recruiting children under 17 and discharge those under 15.The government had said that move did not go far enough.Human rights groups define any member of a force aged under 18 as a child soldier.Army sources estimate that close to half of Farc members have been recruited as minors. One of those was Martin (not his real name).When I spoke to him, he told me how it was a natural thing for him and his brothers to end up in the Farc, a group that was consistently present in the area where they lived.They started, he said, doing errands for the rebels. When he was 11 he became a full member.\"We joined because it was the only choice we had,\" he told me. He left when he was 16.\"The important thing was to regain my freedom, to be able to do whatever I wanted,\" he said.The Farc has in the past said that its youngest members were the offspring of guerrilla fighters or had joined the Farc after they had been orphaned.In its statement on Wednesday, the Farc said that minors joined the rebel group because they had been left \"unprotected\" by the state.The rebels also urged President Juan Manuel Santos to end compulsory military service.The two sides have been engaged in peace talks since November 2012 and have reached agreement on four out of five main issues on their agenda.In September, President Santos set a deadline of 26 March 2016 for a final agreement to be signed, although Farc negotiators have since cast doubts on the probability of meeting that deadline.More than 220,000 people have been killed in almost 52 years of armed conflict in Colombia and more than six million people have been internally displaced.",
        "The report, titled Caught Short, says India has at least 48 million stunted children under the age of five.Nigeria and Pakistan rank second and third with 10.3 and 9.8 million stunted children respectively.Stunting, which is a consequence of malnutrition in the first two years of a child's life, is largely irreversible. It also affects a child's mental growth.Apart from food shortage, other factors like poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water also cause malnutrition, leading to stunted growth among children.\"A lack of access to a toilet, clean water and good hygiene practices also play a major role, as repeated bouts of diarrhoea - often caused by dirty water and unhygienic environments - are directly linked to malnutrition,\" the report says.A quarter of all cases of stunting are estimated to be directly caused by chronic diarrhoea in the first two years of life.At least 76 million people live without safe drinking water in India......and 774 million people live without adequate sanitation facilities. Around 140,000 children die every year due to diarrhoea in India.Open defecation is one of the biggest health problems in India.\"India has the highest number of people in the world - more than half a billion - practising open defecation, which spreads deadly diseases and makes children more susceptible to diarrhoea and other infections,\" says Megan Wilson-Jones, WaterAid's policy analyst on health and hygiene.In the past few years, India has made some progress in reducing the number of stunted children. At least 48% of all children were found to be stunted in 2006, but the number has dropped to 39% in 2014, the charity says.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also made it a priority for his government to provide clean drinking water and proper sanitation for all Indians.",

The average price increase for customers whose deals end in July is £274 per year.The biggest hikes are for those on fixed price tariffs with Npower, First Utility (£364) and EDF Energy (£360).Fixed tariffs can protect customers against rising prices, but have cancellation charges if they wish to switch to a different supplier.Energy regulator Ofgem says two-thirds of customers are on standard variable tariffs, which are typically higher than fixed rate tariffs and do not have cancellation charges.Claire Osborne, from uSwitch.com said: \"Switching tariff is incredibly easy and is definitely worth 10 minutes online, on the phone or on an app.\"You can switch without incurring any exit fees 42 days before the contract end date, and comparing and switching takes just minutes to do.\"Ofgem said that last year saw a surge in customers changing energy suppliers, with switching reaching its highest level since 2010, at about 16% of gas and electricity customers.Of these switches, nearly half (47%) were to small or medium suppliers.The uSwitch site is owned by property website Zoopla.

        "The Dorset Knob Throwing and Food Festival event in Cattistock involves participants tossing the locally made, spherical biscuit as far as they can.The longest throw was by Dave Morrison, who tossed his knob 21.8m (71ft).Organiser Nigel Collins thought up the idea after seeing a Yorkshire pudding throwing contest at a Yorkshire food festival.He said: \"We used to throw knobs occasionally as a child because they're the size of a golf ball, so the whole thing gelled from there.\"Most of the contest is taken in good heart and there is no food wastage. Everything that is left over - even the broken bits on the ground - goes to feed local chickens.\"We needed funding for the playing fields, village hall, cricket club, and football club. We're a very small village, very rural, and we needed a unique event to get people here.\"The savoury biscuits, made by the Moores family since 1880, have to be thrown underarm and one of the competitor's feet must remain on the ground during the toss in order for it to count. The best of three is measured and recorded.The winner receives their winning biscuit and a plaque, while their name is added to a board in the village hall.The record is still held by Dave Phillips with a throw of 29.4m (96ft) in 2012.Other events included a knob eating contest, knob darts, knob weighing, and knob painting.",

        "TWE posted a net loss of 101m Australian dollars ($94m; Â£57m) for the year ended June, compared to a net profit of A$47m the previous year.Slow sales last year led to the group destroying thousands of bottles of excess wine at its US division.The firm also reported an impairment charge of A$384.5m.Without the one-off charge, the group would have earned A$112.8m in net profit after tax.TWE is the world's largest listed winemaker and owns brands such as Wolf Blass, Rosemount and Lindeman's.It is also behind Australia's most well-known winemaker, Penfolds.The company said sales in China were hit by the government's austerity measures. But that was offset by \"continued strong volume growth in Hong Kong and increasing momentum in South East Asia.\"In a statement released with the earnings, the company acknowledged it went through a challenging year. And it said it plans to improve on its performance by boosting its marketing operations in growth markets, notably the US and Asia.For the current financial year ending June 2015, chief executive Michael Clarke said: \"Investing in our sales and marketing capabilities is an important step.\"Crucially it will also facilitate a deeper understanding of our customers and underpin more collaborative and sustainable relationships across all our regions.\"The group has recently been a takeover target and it is sitting on two offers.US based KKR is teaming up with Rhone Capital and they have made an offer of $3.2bn for TWE. That is 11% more than their original offer for the winemaker.Meanwhile an anonymous bidder has, in recent weeks matched that offer.TWE made no mention of the takeover offers in its earnings statement.The winemaker has a turbulent history and is currently undergoing restructuring that will see 175 job cuts.TWE was formed in 1995 as the wine division of Australia's Foster's group, brewers of the eponymous beer.

ITV bought Talpa for £355m earlier this year.But the future of The Voice has become a political hot potato for the corporation as it negotiates with the government over its next royal charter.The Voice was singled out in a consultation paper published by the government ahead of the BBC's charter renewal as a format that is \"similar to ITV's X Factor\", and which was bought in from overseas rather than being developed in-house.Culture Secretary John Whittingdale has questioned whether such shows are \"distinctive\" enough from those aired by commercial rivals.In August, the BBC's director of television Danny Cohen defended the corporation's right to air entertainment shows like The Voice.\"I believe that we should keep fighting for entertainment on Saturday nights on the BBC that reaches a wide range of people up and down the country, from all different sorts of backgrounds,\" he said.\"A show like The Voice, it's really popular with young people, diverse audiences and less well-off audiences and it matters to them as much as Strictly, and we should make sure that we offer both,\" said Cohen.Doubts over the show's future mounted after Tuesday's announcement that Cohen is to leave the corporation.",

It was like thunder,\" one resident, Kularathna, told the Reuters news agency. \"Tiles in our house got cracked.

Footage filmed by the BBC on Saturday showed people continuing to dump rubbish at Meethotamulla.Mr De Silva said residents had been advised to leave because of the risk of landslides.\"It's unfortunate that even though payments had been made for those families under risk of landslides to move out some had not done so. They had even been advised to leave as recently as two days ago,\" he said.Last month, a landslide at a rubbish dump in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killed at least 113 people.",

        "Mr Ghani was speaking after the Taliban released an audio tape said to be from Mullah Mansour in which he calls reports of the firefight \"baseless\".It was said to have taken place near the Pakistani city of Quetta last week.Mansour was declared leader in July after the Taliban confirmed that Mullah Omar had died in 2013.Mansour's appointment then prompted splits in the Taliban.Read moreMr Ghani told a press conference on Monday:  \"There is no evidence that Mansour has been killed.\"He added: \"The incident that occurred should be carefully analysed.\"He was referring to a gunfight that was said to have taken place on the outskirts of the western city of Quetta last Tuesday.Some reports said Mansour had been seriously hurt, others that he had died, along with four Taliban gunmen.Late on Saturday, the Taliban released the audio tape in which the speaker refers to the \"rumour that fighting happened among the Taliban at a time when a meeting was in progress\".\"The rumour says I was injured during the clash and later some media outlets reported that I died. Brothers, this report is not true, there is no doubt that it is enemy propaganda,\" the speaker says.The voice resembled that in previous recordings issued by Mansour but there has still been speculation about its authenticity.In the 17-minute message he says he has not seen the place where the fight was said to have taken place \"for years\", adding: \"I am safe and my colleagues are safe. I am among my colleagues.\"The speaker insists the Taliban will continue to fight to establish an \"Islamic government\" in Afghanistan and resist peace overtures.Since August Mansour has overseen a series of battlefield victories, including briefly capturing the northern Afghan city of Kunduz.But the movement has split into openly warring factions.A number of senior Taliban commanders refused to pledge allegiance to Mansour and a faction opposed to him was set up last month under Mullah Mohammad Rasool.",

        "The eurozone is expected to grow by 1.6% this year and 1.4% in 2017. Before the referendum the IMF had predicted growth of 1.7% for both years.The IMF also revised down its 2018 growth forecast to 1.6% from 1.7%.It said medium-term growth prospects for the 19-member bloc were \"mediocre\" due to high unemployment and debt.Mahmood Pradhan, deputy director of the IMF's European Department, said the outlook could worsen if drawn-out negotiations between the UK and the EU led to a continuation of recent trends in financial markets - where investors have shunned riskier assets.\"If that risk aversion is prolonged, we think the growth impact could be larger and at this point, it is very difficult to tell how long that period lasts,\" he said in a conference call.The revised 2017 figure was the IMF's \"best case\" scenario, assuming a deal was struck that allowed the UK to retain its access to the EU's single market, Mr Pradhan said.However, if the UK decided not to maintain close ties with the EU and chose to rely on World Trade Organization rules, there could be \"major disruptions,\" he said.Mr Pradhan added it was \"very, very early days to have any strong sense of confidence\" about what the eventual relationship between the UK and EU would be.In the medium-term, challenges such as high unemployment and persistent structural weaknesses in the euro area would continue to weigh on growth, the IMF said.\"As a result, growth five years ahead is expected to be about 1.5%, with headline inflation reaching only 1.7%,\" the report said.It also said that as the euro area was such a big player in world trade, any slowdown could have an impact on other economies, including emerging markets, but it expected this to be \"limited\".",

        "Around 20,000 Syrians are expected to be resettled in the UK over the next five years.They discussed concerns about housing, education and healthcare and how extra services would be funded.The Local Government Association has called for more resources to help its members house people rather than use their own limited housing stock.BBC correspondent Daniel Sandford said the UK will look to take in about 400 refugees a month, chosen by the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR. He said the plan was to start taking people in from October.He said: \"Many local authorities are not keen to use their own council housing stock so people are trying to identify landlords who might be able to put up Syrian refugees, paid for by the state.\"Prime Minister David Cameron has said people would come from camps bordering Syria, rather than among those already in Europe.Unlike other asylum seekers they will be able to start work immediately and will be eligible to claim benefits.David Simmons from the Local Government Association said councils wanted reassurance that long-term plans were in place to help people.\"This is not just about money in the short-term but that resources are going to be there so that families and children are properly supported,\" he said.\"They need to be able to integrate into life in the UK and think about their education, their work opportunities and their housing opportunities.\"Meanwhile, Central European ministers have again rejected a mandatory quota system for sharing out migrant arrivals.In recent weeks, tens of thousands of migrants have been trying to make their way to Europe from war-torn Syria and Libya. Many have travelled through Hungary to Germany, Austria and Sweden - wealthier EU nations with more liberal asylum laws.European Council President Donald Tusk has said he will call an emergency summit later this month if a solution to the crisis is not found soon.",
        "Conservative Sir Henry Bellingham said there was \"clear evidence\" of students saying they voted at their home and university addresses.\"Surely this is straightforward electoral fraud,\" he said.Cabinet Office Minister Chris Skidmore promised to raise the \"completely unacceptable\" allegation with the Electoral Commission.Similar allegations about the 8 June election have been made by another Conservative MP, Sir Peter Bone, last week, as well as by ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage.Speaking during Cabinet Office Questions in the Commons, Sir Henry, the MP for North West Norfolk, said: \"Is the minister aware that there is now clear evidence that many students boasted on social media of voting twice - once at university, and once by post at home? Surely this is straightforward electoral fraud.\"Mr Skidmore said this would be \"nothing less than an abuse of our democracy\" and promised to raise it with the Electoral Commission \"as a priority\".\"Let all of us in this House be clear: this is a crime. If anyone has any evidence of people voting twice, they should report it to their local returning officer and the police, who must take this issue seriously,\" he added.According to the Electoral Commission, it is possible to be legally registered to vote in more than one place, if someone is properly resident in each.Where this is the case, they are allowed to vote twice in local government elections - provided they live in two different council areas - but it is illegal to do this in a general election or referendum.Investigating such an offence would be a matter for the police, it said.",

Jordanian media said he was local imam who had been upset by the cartoon.But security sources told the Jordan Times he was a known extremist.A witness told the Associate Press news agency that Mr Abdullah had a long beard and was wearing a long robe, common among conservative Muslims.Nahid Hattar was detained in August for 15 days on charges of insulting God after he published a cartoon depicting a bearded man lying in bed with two women and smoking, asking God to bring him a drink.Mr Hattar was born a Christian, but considered himself an atheist. He was attacked on social media for being anti-Islam.He said he had not meant to cause offence and wanted to expose radical Islamists' view of heaven.Authorities said he had broken the law by sharing the cartoon.Mr Hattar's supporters say they hold the government responsible for his death.\"The prime minister was the first one who incited against Nahid when he ordered his arrest and put him on trial for sharing the cartoon, and that ignited the public against him and led to his killing,\" the writer's cousin, Saad Hattar said.The government has publicly condemned the killing.A spokesperson told Petra news agency: \"The government will strike with an iron hand all those who exploit this crime to broadcast speeches of hatred to our community.\"",

I didn't know how it was going to be.\"The test was not spectacular so coming into today it was quite refreshing to have the car right where I needed it.\"I felt good in the car and I didn't even notice the cars being more physical, which is also a positive because I have trained so hard to be ready for this season.\"The Ferrari is obviously very strong and fast, they might not have the power turned up or whatever and we will see tomorrow, but it seems we are as strong, if not a bit stronger than them.\"F1 has introduced new rules this season aimed at making the cars faster, more demanding and more dramatic.The cars have met those targets but the competitive order appears not to have changed a great deal at this early stage.Asked whether the gap between himself and Hamilton was representative, Vettel said: \"I hope not. Overall it has been OK. The car doesn't yet feel as good as it should and it can so I am confident we will find something overnight.\"We were very happy in testing and the times look good but it doesn't mean anything.\"I am not that happy overall. The balance is not yet where I want it to be. It is not bad but I think we can do better.\"We see where it takes us on Saturday when everyone shows what they can do.

        "On the one hand Ed Miliband is slowly and steadily introducing himself to voters as a potential prime minister.The Labour leader has always argued that the more voters see of him the more they will rate him.Last night he was able to use attacks from the left - on austerity and Trident - as well as assaults from the right - on Europe and immigration - to look statesmanlike.David Cameron's absence gave Mr Miliband the chance to taunt the absent prime minister for his lack of political courage.It also allowed him to focus his fire on the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, trying to create a distance which he has, so far, struggled to create. He rejected her repeated invitations to work together to \"get rid of the Tories\".On the other hand the debate confirmed that the battle for Scotland is the defining drama of this election campaign. The images of the night, the video clips and the memorable sound bites are all of Ed v Nicola.Conservative HQ and the Tory press will take delight in using them to conjure up the spectre of a weak minority Labour government being forced to deal with and placate a rampant SNP. They will point out that for all the times the Labour leader rejects the idea of a coalition with the nationalists he does not - he cannot afford to - rule out the need for a deal or deals to get him into Number 10.What remains totally and fascinatingly unpredictable is which narrative will have the greatest hold on the electorate - growing respect for Ed Miliband as a potential occupant of Number 10 or growing fear of what a government led by him, which was dependent on SNP support, might be like",

        "Marchers carrying placards and banners- many in the Catalan language - accused the Madrid government of dragging its feet over the issue.They say it has not honoured its pledge made in 2015 to allow more than 17,000 refugees into Spain within two years.Over that time, Spain has accepted only about 1,100 refugees.Police gave the estimate of the turnout at Saturday's protest in the capital of Catalonia, organised by the Our Home is Your Home group, with many denouncing the government for not living up to its promises.Protest organisers quoted by local media said that as many as 300,000 people took part.The route took them from the Barcelona city centre to the Mediterranean coast - an end-point seen as highly symbolic given the fact that about 5,000 refugees are estimated to have perished in the sea in 2016.One 62-year-old protester marching alongside his friends and family told the AFP news agency that the demonstration was triggered by the government's lacklustre response to the refugee crisis.\"We demand this minimum amount of dignity - that at least this number of refugees can come,\" Jacint Comelles said.\"In Catalonia, everything is ready to welcome them.\"Child migrantâ€™s body sparks soul searching in SpainBarcelona Mayor Ada Colau participated in the march.

Where are they from? And what heroics typically see someone take the honour?From inaugural winner Stanley Matthews in 1956 to Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo last year, we have profiled each of the recipients prior to Messi's win to analyse the \"perfect\" Ballon d'Or winner.Note: The Ballon d'Or could only be won by European footballers between 1956 and 1994. Nominations were extended to include Europe-based players in 1995. In 2010 it became the world player of the year.So if you're a 26-year-old, dark-haired, right-footed, German/Dutch-born Barcelona forward then you've a great chance of bagging the trophy.But what about winning the World Cup or European Championship? Does lifting either trophy, or simply catching the eye that summer, help propel a player towards Ballon d'Or glory?In World Cup years, 47% of Ballon d'Or winners helped their nation become champions - including England's 1966 hero Sir Bobby Charlton, France's 1998 match-winner Zinedine Zidane and Italy's 2006 victorious captain Fabio Cannavaro.Only 36% helped their nation win the European Championship on the way to earning that year's Ballon d'Or.However, strong performances by an individual at a major international tournament - for example, Czechoslovakia midfielder Josef Masopust at the 1962 World Cup finals, or USSR midfielder Igor Belanov at Mexico 86 - have helped unfancied names earn their place on the gold-covered bauble.England winger Matthews, then aged 41, was the first player to win the prize - but only five other men from the UK have followed in his footsteps.",
        "Rayouf Alhumedhi, 15, has sent a proposal to The Unicode Consortium, a non-profit corporation that reviews and develops new emojis.The idea gained the backing of the co-founder of online discussion forum Reddit, Alexis Ohanian. If approved, her emoji will be available in 2017.The proposal comes as countries across Europe wrestle with the issue of the Muslim veil - in all its forms.The debate takes in religious freedom, female equality, secular traditions and even fears of terrorism.The veil issue is part of a wider debate about multiculturalism in Europe, as many politicians argue that there needs to be a greater effort to assimilate ethnic and religious minorities.Rayouf Alhumedhi told the BBC it was during a group chat with her friends on social media that she had realised there was no emoji to represent her, a headscarf-wearing woman.After reading an article on emoji design, she wrote an email about her idea to Unicode.Intrigued, a member of a Unicode subcommittee replied, offering to help her draft a formal proposal.\"In this day and age, representation is extremely important,\" she said of her reasons behind the project.\"People want to be acknowledged... and recognised, especially in the tech world. This is massive. Emojis are everywhere.\"There are so many Muslim women in this world who wear the headscarf. It might seem trivial... but it's different when you see yourself on the keyboard around the world. Once you experience that, it's really great.\"To boost support for the initiative, Mr Ohanian hosted a Reddit live online discussion on Tuesday where Reddit users could ask Rayouf Alhumedhi about the new idea.Some wanted to see whether they could get involved while others questioned the need for the hijab, saying it was a tool to oppress women.The drafting committee hopes to present a final version of the proposal to Unicode in November.",

        "Singapore Airlines was the launch customer for the two-deck jet in 2007.The airline has decided not to renew the A380 plane when the ten-year contract expires next year.The news comes after Airbus more than halved its delivery target for the A380, raising fears it could slip back to making a loss from the aircraft.A Singapore Airlines spokesperson said: \"Our first five A380s are on 10-year leases, with options to extend. The first expires in October 2017, and we have decided not to extend it.\"For the other four, decisions will be made later.\"But they added the airline had orders for five separate A380s with Airbus, which will start being delivered in the second half of 2017.The A380 only began breaking even for Airbus last year.In July, Airbus said it would still avoid losing money on the jet in 2017 with as few as 20 deliveries, but gave no further guidance.Analysts say that big aircraft like the A380 and Boeing's 747 series have fallen out of favour.Smaller jets can be more profitable as they are easier to fill and are cheaper to operate, analysts say.",

Many parents did not know, he said, that online gaming platforms and services let players communicate anonymously. However, he added, offenders had used this capability in the past to contact and \"groom\" children they later went on to abuse.New York's Electronic Securing and Targeting of Online Predators Act, known as the e-STOP law, requires convicted sex offenders to tell the state which email addresses, login names, screen identities and other online aliases they use. These are then passed on to game and web firms that have signed up to help the programme.Gaming accounts on Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, Gaia Online and many others have been deleted as a result of the law.This action builds on the first stage of the e-STOP programme that saw more than 3,500 online accounts used by sex offenders shut down.",

My kids learned to quote Churchill - 'If you're going through hell, keep going'.\"But the borough's lawyer, Sue Obeney, told the court the legal affair would not have been necessary had matters been addressed 18 months ago.Ms Sotello had refused to \"engage\" with officers and made threats, such as saying her company would charge Â£5,000 for her to attend a meeting, said Ms Obeney.Ms Sotello said she \"had nothing against\" the schools in Chelsea, but said: \"It's simply that school is not the right fit for every child.\"She said she had a \"co-parenting agreement\" with her husband, who works as a deputy director at Sotheby's, as they go through a divorce.The former manager said she had also taken her oldest son, now 20, who she described as musically \"gifted\", out of school after he was \"smacked on the wrist every time he touched the piano\".",

A bogey results in a point being lost, while a double bogey or worse means dropping three points. A par does not affect the scoring.Owen, 45, has taken the lead in Reno, Nevada, on the back of two consecutive 14-point rounds as he aims to end a run of 264 events without a victory on the PGA Tour.His closest rivals are American Derek Fathauer and Australian Stuart Appleby but Owen's lead could have been bigger if he had not lost three points with a double bogey on the final hole of his third round.",

Paramedics subsequently found Ms Mendes.Solicitors for her family said she was heard to scream and hang-up when she made the call.The call operator rang back and two men answered, denying there was a problem.However, Ms Mendes, originally from Portugal, confirmed she was being beaten and was heard saying \"don't beat me, don't touch me\".The operator told the men police would attend within the hour but did not categorised the call as \"violence\", solicitors Hodge Jones and Allen said.No-one has been charged over her death, the firm said.

A sample of 35 complaints was read out.Prosecutors argued that Geert Wilders crossed a line when he asked supporters if they wanted \"fewer or more Moroccans\" in the Netherlands.After supporters chanted back \"fewer\", he replied: \"We'll organise that.\"Mr Wilders denounced the trial as an attempt to suppress freedom of speech.\"This is a political process, and I refuse to co-operate with it. We have to talk about politics in parliament, not in the courtroom,\" he said in a statement read by his lawyer.But the prosecutor insisted Mr Wilders was wrong to assume that as a politician his remarks were exempt from laws on hate speech.In 2011, Mr Wilders was acquitted of incitement after being accused of encouraging hatred towards Muslims.The latest trial comes as opinion polls suggest the PVV is consistently faring well in polls, ahead of parliamentary elections in March.The party is currently second, behind Prime Minister Mark Rutte's liberal VVD, and is predicted to win 23 seats in the 150-seat parliament.",

Cambridge, London and Brighton were top for cost-effective renting.The survey found that in Glasgow, Coventry and Birmingham renters could pay more than Â£100 a month than those with a mortgage.Renters were most likely to be better off than mortgage payers in pockets of the South, where the supply of homes is tight and house prices are high.Cambridge, London and Brighton are the top places where renting is cheaper than paying a mortgage, the research suggests.In Cambridge, the average monthly rent was found to be about Â£769 less than a mortgage payment.Lawrence Hall, a spokesman for Zoopla, said: \"Once you get past the initial fees that come with a house purchase, such as a deposit and stamp duty, our figures show that it can pay to try and get on the property ladder.\"On top of the enjoyment that can come with owning your property, buyers may also find themselves with more disposable income at the end of the month than those renting their homes.\"Particularly if you're in Scotland, northern England or in the West Midlands, taking the first step on to the ladder and sacrificing the flexibility of renting can be a much cheaper alternative.\"Zoopla's research assumed that someone buying a home had a 10% deposit and was paying a 25-year repayment mortgage with an interest rate of 4.5%.When the data was last analysed by Zoopla in October 2015, buying was cheaper than renting in just over one third of cities.",

The Medical Board of Australia had applied for Dr Patel's ban after criminal proceedings ended.Dr Patel's case stemmed from his time working at a hospital in Queensland between 2003 and 2005.There were complaints from hospital staff that he had botched operations, misdiagnosed patients and used sloppy surgical techniques.He was arrested in the US in 2008 and extradited to Australia to stand trial.He was jailed for seven years in 2010 after being convicted of criminal negligence leading to the deaths of three patients. He was also found guilty of causing harm to another patient.But in 2012, Australia's highest court quashed the convictions on appeal and retrials were ordered. He was subsequently acquitted in one case and the jury failed to reach a decision in another.In 2013, prosecutors dropped outstanding charges.

The college said the rest of the money would be loaned.The college said students would be able to continue their studies at the Basford Hall site during construction as the new campus would be built around the existing one.Dawn Whitemore, principal and CEO of New College Nottingham, said the campus would become a regional hub for training in construction, science, technology and sustainable technologies.She added: \"We are determined to ensure it is a true 'community college' which reflects the hopes and aspirations of those living nearby, we are committed to supporting everyone who wants to learn, wherever their starting point.\"Basford Hall campus, which dates to the 1960s, was saved from closure six years ago.

The Russian leader is also due to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday.Relations between the US and Russia nosedived after the Russian annexation of Crimea in March 2014.

However, Sky also pays some channel providers to include their content in subscription packages.Discovery had claimed Sky did not pay a \"fair price\" for its channels - but Sky said Discovery's threat to remove the channels was about \"commercial self-interest\".Announcing the agreement, Mr Van Rooyen said: \"The deal has been concluded on the right terms after Discovery accepted the proposal we gave them over a week ago.\"A spokesman for Discovery said the deal was \"meaningfully better than our former agreement and their proposal\".He said: \"Our new arrangement enables us to control our destiny in more ways, with even more opportunities to invest and launch channels and consumer services.\"Tim Westcott, senior principal analyst in TV programming at IHS Markit said Sky was probably looking for ways to save money when renegotiating channel carriage deals, as it copes with large rises in sports rights costs.\"Sky is trying to control its operating costs. One way of doing that is to cut back on what it pays channel providers,\" said Mr Westcott.Discovery's portfolio in the UK includes Discovery Channel, Eurosport, TLC, Animal Planet and DMAX.

        "It brings the total UK assistance to Iraq since June 2014 to £79.5m.The money will pay for food, medicine, shelter and clothing, and provide clean water and improved sanitation to help prevent the spread of cholera.Minister Desmond Swayne said \"the world's gaze appears to have wandered\" from the suffering of those in Iraq.The so-called Islamic State controls swathes of Iraq's territory, and in places where it has implemented its strict interpretation of Sharia, women are forced to wear full veils, public beheadings are common and non-Muslims are forced to choose between paying a special tax, converting or death.More than eight million people require humanitarian assistance inside Iraq, with 3.2 million Iraqis internally displaced.Speaking during a visit to the country, Mr Swayne said: \"We cannot separate out what is happening in Iraq from the instability gripping Syria and the wider region.\"The UN's latest appeal is seriously underfunded and we do not want to see more Iraqis being forced to move because they cannot get the help they need where they are.\"Donors must step up to meet the shortfall now, to prevent Iraq's problems spilling over its borders.\"In June, the UN warned that critical aid operations supporting millions of people in Iraq were at risk of shutting down without an urgent increase in funding.It is appealing for nearly $500m (£330m) to cover the immediate needs of 5.6 million Iraqis for the next six months.",
        "It is not known whether his bionic arm had any role in causing the accident.Christian Kandlbauer, 22, was found in the wreckage of his specially-adapted Subaru on Tuesday.Late on Thursday he was pronounced brain-dead in intensive care at the Graz hospital and his life support was switched off.Mr Kandlbauer lost both of his arms four years ago, after being shocked by 20,000 volts.He was fitted with a mind-controlled robotic arm by the medical technology company Otto Bock Healthcare, which said it was the first project of its kind in Europe.Using both his left and right arm - which was a normal prosthetic limb - he was able to pass his driving test in a specially converted car.On Tuesday he was found by a lorry driver who came across his burning car on a road near Bad Waltersdorf in south-east Austria.The driver managed to put out the flames, but it needed firefighters to extract Mr Kandlbauer from the mangled wreckage.He had been interviewed by the BBC about his revolutionary limb earlier this year.\"I feel very happy,\" he said at the time. \"It is like my earlier arm - I feel that my arm is a part of my body.\"He had returned to work as a warehouse clerk at the garage that once employed him as a mechanic.He said he was grateful that he had the freedom to get on with his life.",
        "Terry Morgan, a recently retired publican from Cockwood in Devon, set his alarm to drinking up time, 22:55.He said he scoured his home before realising the timepiece had been swallowed by Charlie the dog.Charlie was taken to the vet but \"coughed\" the watch up before an operation became necessary.\"At first I thought he was lying on it,\" said Mr Morgan.\"Only when I rolled him over did I realise it was inside him.\"The watch was always set to go off at ten-fifty-five to remind me to call last orders.\"Luckily, I'd never bothered to change it.\"Mr Morgan said a surgical operation to retrieve the timepiece would have cost £1,000.The episode still cost Mr Morgan £200 because vets had to X-ray Charlie to make sure the animal had not swallowed anything else.\"I've also had to put up with the endless 'Time' jokes from the regulars,\" said Mr Morgan.A spokesman for the St David's Veterinary Group in Exeter said: \"It was the talk of the surgery. We had a real laugh about it.\"",
        "Neil Hamilton said that with Brexit achieved, UKIP's aim now was to inform the Welsh electorate of its domestic policies.And he denied the party had outlived its purpose, following the vote to leave the European Union.His comments come despite UKIPs loss in Stoke-on-Trent Central's by-election on Friday.The party had hoped to capitalise on voters' leanings towards Brexit - the area voted strongly to leave the EU in June - but Labour held its seat.UKIP was founded in 1991 with the sole aim of getting the UK out of the EU.But Mr Hamilton defended the role of his party post-Brexit while speaking to Sunday Politics Wales.\"In the last 20 years, UKIP has become an essential, particularly in Wales, part of the domestic political scene and we now have to refocus our attention upon other issues,\" he said.\"We have serious work now in order to show people we do have other policies which can benefit them in their daily lives.\"With six assembly members, UKIP are hoping to establish a further foot-hold in Wales in the up-coming local elections.\"Carywn Jones doesn't hold a majority in the assembly, he can only do so with the combination of other parties,\" Mr Hamilton said.\"We are an important voice in Wales, we got the best part of 15% of the vote in the assembly election last year and all the current opinion polls show that we would actually do better in Wales today than we did last May.\"",
        "Over the next three days, rail services between Great Yarmouth and Norwich, Marks Tey and Sudbury, and Ipswich and Felixstowe are being replaced by buses.The company has apologised for the cancellations, which it said were due to trains needing repairs to damaged wheels.Great Yarmouth MP Brandon Lewis said the situation was \"unacceptable\".The rail journeys have been cancelled due to Abellio's diesel trains suffering wheel damage as a result of poor rail conditions.\"This situation leads to excessive wear on the wheels which must be repaired before the trains can re-enter service\", a spokesman for the train operator said.\"On average we are continuing to see two trains arrive back at the end of each day with wheel damage, more than double the rate we have experienced in previous autumn periods.\"Conservative MP Mr Lewis said: \"At a time when we are trying to encourage people into the centre of Great Yarmouth, this is just not good enough.\"It is an important time of the year for the high street, with new shops opening.\"He said Abellio \"should be able to manage their stock\" to prevent this situation arising.Ian Edwards, chairman of the Marks Tey and Colchester Rail Users Group, said: \"They (Abellio) have not invested enough. All they are looking for are cost savings. This is not good enough.\"An Abellio spokesman said: \"We apologise for the ongoing impact of train service cancellations affecting our local routes.\"We are doing everything possible to repair the trains affected as fast as we can. We are working with Network Rail to try and improve rail conditions to prevent further damage.\"A Network Rail spokesman said: \"We are running extra rail cleaning trains and have had extra staff out on track to keep things moving. We are doing everything we can to minimise disruption and will continue to work with Abellio.\"",
        "Mylo Johnstone was with friends at the site off Wyther Lane, Kirkstall, Leeds on Thursday at 20:30 BST when he fell onto the building's concrete floor.Paramedics gave emergency treatment but he died at the scene.Two boys were seriously hurt in similar incidents in the city in recent weeks, prompting police to warn children against entering abandoned buildings.Det Insp Phil Jackson, of West Yorkshire Police, said: \"I think they were exploring and being mischievous, there was a group of 14-year-old boys and unfortunately Mylo Johnstone fell to his death.\"While we are still carrying out inquiries into this incident, every indication is that this has been a tragedy with no suspicious circumstances.\"Officers have carried out forensic examinations at the scene, with Leeds City Council and the Health and Safety Executive also involved in the investigation.Tribute messages left at the gates outside the warehouse complex described Mylo as a \"lovely lad\" who would be \"sorely missed\".On 20 June, a 12-year-old boy was injured at a disused factory in Modder Avenue, Armley. A 13-year-old boy was hurt at a derelict building in Ninelands Lane, Garforth, on 28 May.\"We are obviously coming up the school holidays and clearly there is potential for young people to be tempted to try to explore abandoned sites,\" Det Insp Jackson said.\"We would ask that they think very carefully about the dangers this involves, as has been starkly illustrated by these incidents, and that they consider the consequences that could have on their lives and the lives of their families.\"He added: \"I know they might be really interesting and intriguing to look through, but some of these buildings are death traps.\"",
        "Jeff Lynne's ELO will step into Lionel Richie's shoes during Glastonbury's \"legends\" slot on Sunday, 26 June.Dolly Parton's stint in the slot drew Glastonbury's biggest ever crowd in 2014, while Richie's appearance last year sent him to the top of the charts.The main headliners for this year's festival have yet to be announced.However, Muse, Adele, Coldplay and Rihanna have all been rumoured to top the bill on the Pyramid Stage.Formerly known as Electric Light Orchestra, ELO was formed by Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood in 1970.They had an 18-year run of hits, such as Roll Over Beethoven, Telephone Line, Sweet Talkin' Woman and The Diary of Horace Wimp.Known for their lavish stage shows, they sold 50 million records before Lynne called time in 1988.He tried to revive the band in 2001 with a new album, Zoom, but ticket sales for a comeback tour were so dismal it was cancelled.But an on-air campaign by BBC Radio 2's Chris Evans pressured the band into reuniting in 2013 for a one-off show in Hyde Park.The response was so overwhelming, Lynne returned to the studio and began work on a new album, Alone in the Universe, under the moniker Jeff Lynne's ELO.The album has since gone platinum in the UK, while the band stole the show at last year's Grammy Awards.Confirming the news, Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis tweeted: \"Yes! ELO are playing this year's Glastonbury Sunday teatime slot. Can't wait!\"But she might be tempting fate by booking a band best known for the song Mr Blue Sky to play during the notoriously rainy festival.",
        "Ewan Williamson died in July 2009 after becoming trapped while tackling a blaze at the Balmoral Bar on Dalry Road.Last year the service was fined Â£54,000 after admitting health and safety breaches that contributed to his death.The SFRS has published a report into the incident containing a series of lessons and recommendations.They include the urgent need for a policy on the use of breathing apparatus, tactical ventilation of buildings and improved communication.The report also identified a need for risk management training and support for firefighters in stressful situations.Mr Williamson, 35, was the first firefighter in the history of the Lothian and Borders Fire Service to die tackling a blaze.He became trapped in conditions of zero visibility and extreme heat as he was deployed at the incident on 12 July 2009.Alasdair Hay, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service chief officer, said there was a commitment to implementing all the recommendations.He said: \"Moving to a single service gave us the unique opportunity to introduce the pan-Scotland programme in 2014 and since then we have been proactively learning from the past to improve firefighter safety in the future. We are making progress.\"He added: \"The role of a firefighter will always be inherently dangerous but this report will help us reduce potential risk through more effective procedures and a culture of continuous improvement.\"Chris McGlone, Fire Brigades Union executive council member, welcomed the report.He said: \"We are confident that, when fully implemented, the Safer Firefighter Programme will promote lasting improvements to the safety of firefighters not only in Scotland but across the UK.\"We believe that this report can be the start of that journey and will help us to achieve our shared aim that no firefighter should lose their life protecting our communities.\"",
        "The San Francisco Chronicle said Mr Baker died in his sleep at his home in New York on Thursday night.He initially designed an eight-colour flag in 1978 for the city's gay freedom day, the precursor to the modern pride parade.A candlelight vigil is planned for Friday evening in San Francisco.Screenwriter Dustin Lance Black tweeted: \"Rainbows weep. Our world is far less colourful without you, my love. Gilbert Baker gave us the rainbow flag to unite us.
