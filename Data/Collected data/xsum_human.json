        "Two special concerts at the Royal Albert Hall will see pupils perform their own response to 10 pieces of classic music. The Ten Pieces project was announced last year as part of an initiative to inspire primary school children to learn more about classical music. Each Prom will feature pupils playing music, as well as dance, film and animation. The schoolchildren's work will run alongside the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, which will play the original 10 pieces of music, which include Mozart, Handel and Holst. Blue Peter's Barney Harwood and children's TV presenters Dick and Dom will host the concerts on 18 and 19 July, the opening weekend of this year's Proms. The Saturday concert will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 3, while the Sunday concert will be recorded for future broadcast on BBC Radio 2. Last June, the BBC announced ten pieces of classical music aimed at inspiring schoolchildren to create their own works. Since October 2014, some 8,500 primary school pupils have signed up to take part in the scheme, which offers musical workshops from local arts organisations as well as an online film about classical music, which has been seen by more than 120,000 children so far. The schoolchildren are being invited to submit their \"creative responses\" to the music to the Ten Pieces website, as either films, audio recordings or images, by the end of March. The full 2015 BBC Proms season will be announced in April.

        "Dave Walsh, president of Liverpool Trades Council, said the council should not be afraid of setting an illegal budget. He said: \"There's an old saying in the Labour movement,'better to break the law than the poor'. Vulnerable people in this city are going to be left without care.\" But Mayor Joe Anderson said the council would set a legal budget. He said: \"This city was set back 30 years ago by people setting an illegal budget. There's two options, either set a legal budget or an illegal budget. \"I'm on the side of setting a legal budget - as tough as that is.\" The council has rejected calls for the authority to ignore government spending targets and set an illegal budget. In the 1980s, Liverpool's Labour-controlled council set an illegal budget which led to the banning of and surcharge of 47 councillors. The council has to save PS156m over the next three years, on top of PS173m worth of cuts over the last three years. The latest financial position shows that Liverpool City Council will have to save PS45m in 2014-15, PS63m in 2015-16 and PS48m in 2016-17. Traffic near to the Town Hall in Dale Street was blocked by the protest on Wednesday evening and police stepped in to clear the road as a woman was trying to get to hospital.",
        "But it has perhaps been more like Pinter than Shakespeare. The menacing silences, the bullying over polite exchanges, the brutal quest for dominance as self-confidence drains from one man to another. So here is a cut-out-and-keep guide for any budding dramatist on what we know and what I've found out. The day of the referendum. I'm told Michael Gove and Boris Johnson go to bed with only one speech prepared - to acknowledge defeat. 04:45 BST A mobile phone rings in the Gove household. His wife, Sarah Vine - as she explained in her Daily Mail column - hears her husband's phone go off. Then this exchange. \"Michael, guess what? We've won!\" \"Gosh.\" She wrote in her column: \"Given Michael's high-profile role in the Leave campaign, that means he - we - are now charged with implementing the instructions of 17 million people. \"And that is an awesome responsibility.\" As the mobile phones go mad: You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off,' I said, in my best (ie not very good) Michael Caine Italian Job accent. \"In other words, you've really torn it now.\" The tear widens as David Cameron resigns. Boris Johnson was at home with a small team, watching the prime minister resign live on TV. Victory, one insider said, was the moment it all went wrong. Another told me Boris felt he was staring down both barrels of a gun. He had rather a nice life - did he really want to be PM? Watching the prime minister resign, Team Boris think Gove, who'd been talking to Osborne, might come on board. Then pretty much public silence from the man who hoped to be prime minister. Cut to a close-up of the thwack of willow on leather - Boris at the wicket of a rather posh, rather jolly, cricket match. Then an apparently quite amusing barbecue at his country house. Michael Gove joined him - and said that together they were the dream team. He was promised he'd become chancellor and be in charge of Brexit negotiations. But had the Tory establishment decided, as one insider told me, they did not want another Old Etonian - another face from that Bullingdon Club photo - as their leader in an anti-elitist age? Did someone urge Gove to sign up with the intention of doing the indecent thing? Morning Please, no cliches of the spinning presses. However, Boris Johnson's Daily Telegraph column is the next scene. \"It is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration,\" he writes. \"I do not believe that is so.... British people will still be able to go and work in the EU; to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes; and to settle down.\" Was this the turning point? Too soft, too un-Brexity, for Michael Gove? Hardly. He had sent an email at 18:00 on Sunday urging only minor changes and describing it as \"very, very good.\" 17:00 BST Gove is shown the spreadsheet of MPs supporting Boris. One source told me that early in a leadership election all that matters is numbers. You need to pull in the left, the right, young, old, Leave, Remain. Morning A meeting at the Park Lane offices of the Australian super-strategist Sir Lynton Crosby. Team Boris are surprised by the appearance of Gove's youthful eminence grise, Dominic Cummings. His exclusion has already been demanded. Then comes the first pubic hint of unease. An e-mail from Vine to her husband Gove finds its way to journalists. \"One simple message: you MUST have SPECIFIC assurances from Boris OTHERWISE you cannot guarantee your support,\" it says. She tells him: \"Do not concede any ground. Be your stubborn best.\" Adding: \"The details can be worked out later on, but without that you have no leverage. \"Crucially, the membership will not have the necessary reassurance to back Boris, neither will DacreMurdoch (the editor of the Daily Mail and News International boss respectively), who instinctively dislike Boris but trust your ability enough to support a BorisGove ticket.\" Speaking in London, Rupert Murdoch says he'd be \"happy for Michael Gove to get it\" and describes him as \"the most principled and most able\" candidate available. 18:00 BST Team Boris say they have 63 MPs solidly backing them. Morning The critical day. 10 Greycoat Place, near London's Victoria station, is established as the JohnsonGove HQ. 18:00 BST Team Boris report they have 97 MPs \"locked in solid.\" 19:00 BST Boris goes to a Conservative MPs' party at Westminster. There are suggestions from Gove's side that Boris bungles this and support is draining away. In particular they claim he forgets a letter promising rising star Andrea Leadsom she can become chancellor as price for her support. Team Boris say this is nonsense, and Gove had already been promised this job. Team Gove say she could have had deputy prime minister. But for them it crystallises something. Gove begins to think Boris is too cavalier and unfocused - an unguided missile. 20:00 BST Boris joins Gove and the prime minister at a party at the Hurlingham Club. Was it the scene of more intrigue? Do we see Michael Gove glad-handing, plotting, building support? Is he being lobbied? Or does he seem a distracted, lonely figure? The prime minister is there. Do they talk? I'm told by an eyewitness at another party - held during the referendum - that Sarah Vine went up to the prime minister and said: \"Are we OK?\" He apparently hissed: \"If you just get your husband off the telly, we'll be fine.\" My source said: \"Everyone just rocked back - it was quite public.\" 22:00 BST Boris leaves with a key member of Team Gove to write his speech - the most of important of his life. His pitch to become prime minister. Around midnight The Team Gove member takes a series of phone calls. He then makes his excuses and leaves. Gove tries to speak to Chancellor George Osborne, but can't get through. 08:00 BST Dominic Raab has written in the Sun, backing Boris for PM. He says the former London mayor has got the Heineken effect', that refreshes the parts that more conventional politicians cannot reach.\" But cancels a planned interview on the Today programme. 08:00 BST Gove formally tells his team he is going to run. 08:35 BST The team at Greycoat Place get a call from a journalist telling them Gove is jumping ship. \"Rubbish,\" they tell her. 08:40 BST They listen in horror as Sir Lynton Crosby takes a call from Gove, telling him he's running. \"I felt kicked in the stomach, it's nasty stuff. Gove is deeply ambitious and he was persuaded he didn't need Boris. It could be him. It was all about power,\" says one insider. 11:25 BST Moments before Boris is about to go on stage, his small team decides he can't run. 11:50 BST Boris Johnson announces he will not stand for the Tory leadership. Afternoon Team Boris are beside themselves with fury. One sends a text message to the Sun's political editor Tom Newton Dunn. It describes Gove in colourful language, adding that he had \"set this up from start.\" \"This is going to be bloody,\" it adds. Another emails of Gove: \"He is actually Theon Greyjoy, or will be by the time I am finished with him.\" If you don't follow Game of Thrones - that political drama with added dragons - Theon is tortured, castrated, and tortured again, until he is barely human. Politics makes such good drama because it is about the lust for power, driving ambition, the balance between cynicism and belief. It is about when to strike - brutal and quick - and when to stay the hand. But it is also about personality, about an inner life and inner doubts that haunt us all. It is about self-confidence and the need for love. Never more so than in this drama. Many feel it was about Boris's need to be loved that drove him to Brexit as much as ambition. His team were clearly delighted that passing taxi drivers shouted \"Oi, Boris\" with amused approval. But he didn't like the abuse he was now getting travelling around London after the referendum. His calculation had probably been that he would be applauded by the crowd; loved by the party as a good loser who chose the side that lost; in pole position for a big job in David Cameron's next cabinet - and then perhaps an even bigger one. He perhaps hadn't thought through whether he was really up for it - or up to it. He was never truly clubbable, never a House of Commons man, cultivating friendships. Like the Earl of Essex he \"veil his bonnet to an oyster wife, and with a kind of humble conge (bow) greet, the vulgar sort that did admire his life\" (anon). Essex too forgot the establishment - the Palace, the Court - carried the power of execution. Johnson's camp portrays Gove as the ultimate Machiavellian villain, driven by an ambitious wife, and adviser, plotting from within to destroy one close ally and then another, climbing the greasy pole with the hand grips of treachery and betrayal. They say that is foolish, because Gove was always the anchor, and it was always a negotiation, a deal - simply one that didn't come off. Perhaps Gove would prefer a softer version of betrayal, with him as Shakespeare's Prince Hal, shaking off Falstaff and his amusing but ultimately childish ways as he grew to power. It was all too hasty, thinks one insider, in sorrow not anger - they were all pushed over the edge by the speed of events. But don't mistake the fury. There will be another act. I am told: \"This isn't over. Gove did need Boris. And Boris hasn't spoken yet.\"",
        "Here are the best bits we heard backstage at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In La La Land, Emma Stone plays aspiring actress Mia Dolan. So does the best actress winner think Mia could ever win a Bafta or Oscar? After a dramatic pause, she delivered her verdict. \"Hopefully!\" \"It's been like a whirlwind,\" said Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, winner of the Rising Star Award. \"I'm so happy everything seems to be working out.\" The 20-year-old Brit isn't wrong there. Having made his screen debut in tsunami disaster movie The Impossible, he first appeared as Spidey in Captain America: Civil War and recently finished filming for Spider-Man: Homecoming. But Tom admitted the super hero role has its drawbacks. \"Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to be Spider-Man. It's been so fun, but my legs are in bits right now from spider poses after spider poses. \"So I'll be sitting down for the rest of the evening!\" It was perhaps inevitable that Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes would come up at the Baftas. Asked about Donald Trump's response, supporting actress winner Viola Davis didn't hold back. \"Anyone who labels Meryl Streep an'overrated' actress obviously doesn't know anything about acting,\" she said. \"That's not just directed towards Donald Trump - that's directed towards anyone.\" She didn't stop there. \"This is someone who is the master at her skill and she has lasted for 40 years in a very difficult profession,\" Viola continued. \"One of the things people have to know about this woman is that she is the most honourable, accessible human being you could possibly want to meet.\" Best actor winner Casey Affleck said he'd grabbed a word with Meryl Streep after the Baftas ceremony. \"She was taking pictures of people.... and I told her how much her speech at the Golden Globes meant to all of us and how grateful I was that she did it and kicked in the door a little bit,\" he said. The Manchester by the Sea star said he hoped more actors would speak out. \"There is a big audience for these awards shows.... and I have to say I'm very proud to be a part of the arts community. \"I don't always say some of the things I would like to say in those opportunities because there are people like Meryl Streep who say them much better than I can - and if they are going to be said it should be said very, very well because they are important.\" \"I'm a little bit wobbly,\" confessed Dev Patel a few minutes after winning the supporting actor prize for Lion. \"I really did not expect it, we have gone to so many awards ceremony and this one is where everything changed, on home turf with my family.\" Dev recalled how he had made his acting debut a decade ago on E4's teen drama Skins. \"I remember the first time I ever stepped on a film set, I never knew what a boom mic was,\" he laughed. \"My mum took me to an open casting of Skins after she saw an advert in Metro newspaper and 10 years on we are here at the Baftas - that is pretty amazing.\" Justin Hurwitz, who won the Bafta for his original music in La La Land, said that he'd written a title song that didn't end up in the movie. \"It was going to be in the middle of the movie but we nixed that, and then we toyed with using it in the end credits, and we nixed that at the last minute.\" And how about this? Another Day of Sun, from the famous traffic jam scene, was cut \"for many months\" before being put back in as the big opening number. Mel Brooks, who was awarded the prestigious Bafta Fellowship, was asked about whether he might write a comedy about Donald Trump. \"I'm not afraid of him, I don't think he's dangerous,\" said the 90-year-old writer, actor and producer. \"I think he's mostly an entertainer, a guy who wants audiences to love him. \"What I'm afraid of are all the guys around him, the people who whisper in his ears, like the people who whispered in George W Bush's ears and we got the Iraq War... \"I just hope that Trump stays the egomaniac he is, listens to no-one and then we'll all be safe. But if he believes these guys we're all in trouble.\" Mel was in a lighter mood as he plugged his new musical Young Frankenstein, which will open in London's West End this year after a run in Newcastle. \"I think, modestly speaking, it will be sensational,\" he chuckled.

        "A police source told the BBC that an infiltrator from the Taliban had allowed militants into the police station in the regional capital of Lashkar Gah last night. The infiltrator fled the scene with the Taliban, he said. A spokesperson for provincial governor Omar Zuak confirmed the incident, but did not provide details. No group has officially claimed responsibility. Lashkar Gah has come under increased pressure from the Taliban in recent months. The city of 200,000 people is seen as strategically important, and the key to holding Helmand province. The province is both a fertile farming region and a centre for opium production, bordering Pakistan on one end and covering major routes between cities. Thousands of people fled the rural areas to shelter in Lashkar Gah last August, before the city itself came under attack in October. The city was previously the scene of heavy fighting between the Taliban and Nato-led forces before their withdrawal in 2014.",
        "Thousands of border agency workers are expected to strike on 30 November in protest at government pension changes. Ministers fear there could be major disruption for travellers, so volunteers are being asked to step in. PCS Union chief Mark Serwotka said ministers were in a \"blind panic\" and should be resolving the dispute. The UK Border Agency has insisted the civil servants will be properly trained. It is expected they would mainly check the passports of travellers arriving from the European Economic Area and man so-called \"e-gates\" where passengers use their biometric passports. A UKBA spokesman said: \"The security of the UK border remains our top priority and it is absolutely right we explore all options to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union action.\" However, union chiefs expressed concern that the officials might not be properly trained and that borders could be put at risk. Mr Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, blamed ministers for leaving it so late to try and resolve the dispute. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the call to civil servants was an example of \"blind panic\" at the 11th hour, he said, and accused the government of engaging in a misleading \"PR exercise\" about public sector pensions to try to force through \"damaging\" changes. \"Instead of scratching around trying to put untrained people on the front line, they should say today they want urgent talks to try to resolve the dispute,\" he said. The government has confirmed earlier reports that UKBA is planning to fly some officials home from overseas positions to help deal with the strike. In the wake of the recent row between Home Secretary Theresa May and former UK border force chief Brodie Clark over the relaxation of controls during the summer, it is extremely unlikely that officials would be prepared to bypass any rules to ease the pressure of queues. The BBC has also learned that the government has told union bosses that they are not prepared to offer any further concessions over pension reforms as a result of the planned strikes. The government recently made what it describes as an improved offer to the unions, promising that public sector workers ten years away from retirement would not see any change to their pensions. It also promised improved accrual rates. Ministers fear that any further concessions would send the wrong signal to financial markets by suggesting that the government was not serious about cutting the deficit and making substantial savings in the public sector pension bill. Ministers argue that public sector pensions have become unaffordable because of rising life expectancy, but they insist that even after the planned changes, state employees will still be better off than the majority of workers in the private sector. Unions say their members are being asked to work longer, contribute more and receive less.",
        "The environment department said anyone who injures, kills or disturbs Arctic Terns could face prosecution. A spokesman said three walkers with dogs were seen \"attacking\" the birds with sticks and stones last weekend. Biodiversity Officer Dr Richard Selman said: \"Arctic terns will defend their nests and this can be painful.\" He added: \"Unfortunately, terns abandon their nests when the pressure from people or predators gets too great. \"They nest in a limited area and I hope people will respect the controls provided in order to give them the best chance of raising their young.\" Arctic terns, which have the scientific name of Sterna paradisaea, have an average wingspan of 75-85cm. The birds, which mate for life, lay one or two eggs in a small space of ground.",
        "Organisers said they were not opposed to gay or lesbian rights, but wanted to defend family values and the institution of marriage. The demonstrators called for a meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto. Gay and lesbian activists staged rival protests. Public opinion in Mexico, a predominantly Roman Catholic nation, has been split since Mr Pena Nieto announced in May plans to change the constitution. Same-sex marriages are legal in some Mexican states, but Mr Pena Nieto wants it to be allowed across the country. Last year the Supreme Court declared that a ban on such unions imposed in many of Mexico's states was unconstitutional. Leaders of the National Front for the Family, which organised the march, say they are not opposed to LGBT rights. But they argue that Mexico has fallen victim of an ideological battle that threatens family values and the institution of marriage. \"In a democratic society you cannot impose a single thought,\" said Mario Alberto Romo, a spokesman for the group. Demonstrators are calling for a meeting with Mr Pena Nieto to debate the issue. LGBT rights supporters turned up at the march to show their backing for Mr Pena Nieto's proposal to legalise same-sex marriage, but police said there were no clashes. Some of them carried banners that read: \"I'm gay and I'm a Catholic\" and \"We also have families.\" Four Latin American countries have already legalised same-sex marriage: Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and most recently Colombia.",
        "The Lancastria troopship was carrying between 6,000 and 9,000 people when it was sunk by German dive bombers on 17 June 1940. Only about 2,500 people survived in the largest single loss of life for British forces in the whole of World War II. Relatives and survivors have until 15 May to apply for a commemorative medal. The Scottish government commissioned a medal in 2008, issuing more than 375 since. The upcoming 75th anniversary of the event signals the closure of the commemorative medal application process. The Lancastria, a converted Cunard liner built on the Clyde, was carrying servicemen - including about 400 Scots - and a number of civilian women and children when it was bombed by German planes, sinking within minutes off the coast of France. At the time news of the disaster was suppressed by the British government because of the impact it might have on the country's morale. Nearly six weeks later the New York Times broke the story, printing dramatic pictures of the disaster. Veterans' Secretary Keith Brown said: \"We in Scotland feel a strong bond with the servicemen and women who have served us throughout the years and continue to protect the democratic freedoms we still enjoy today. \"The commemorative HMS Lancastria medal from the Scottish government is a lasting reminder of our gratitude to those who made the ultimate sacrifice on that fateful day. Their memory is honoured, their place in history is secured.\" Mr Brown appealed for anyone who believes they or a family member is entitled to a medal to come forward and make a claim.",
        "Some 563 were held or arrested by Port of Dover police officers last year - up from 148 in 2013, a BBC Radio Kent Freedom of Information request shows. The figures come days after dozens of migrants attempted to storm the Channel Tunnel's Calais terminal. The Home Office said it was providing funding to bolster security and that many crossing attempts had been foiled. The FoI shows 46 illegal immigrants were detained or arrested at Dover - one of the main gateways to Britain - between January and April this year. The number of detentions and arrests is also up significantly from 2012, when 105 were held or arrested. Around 3,000 migrants from countries including Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan are camped at a site dubbed \"the Jungle II\" near the Port of Calais. French aid workers have reported a \"catastrophic\" situation there. Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett, who recently visited Calais, said migrants are going to great lengths to cross the Channel. He told Radio Kent: \"They think it's a great place to be and (Britain's) their target. They will do anything they possibly can to get into the UK.\" Last week, Channel Tunnel services were delayed and cancelled after immigrants entered restricted areas on the French side. And last month hundreds of migrants tried to board UK-bound lorries amid chaos as a strike forced the suspension of services through the tunnel. Eurotunnel said at the time that the number of migrants in the Calais area was the \"highest ever.\" Hauliers have been advised by the Freight Transport Association not to stop within about 60 miles (97km) of Calais, to stick with other drivers and make sure padlocks are always kept on vehicles. Responding to the latest figures, a Home Office spokesman said 40,000 attempted illegal crossings of the Channel had been foiled last year. He added: \"We are providing funding to bolster the security of ports in northern France and Belgium, including a PS2m upgrade of detection technology, a PS1m extension of dog searching capacity and PS12m to reinforce security at Calais and other ports. \"During the current period of disruption to cross-Channel services, Border Force has put its contingency plans into operation to ensure security is maintained. \"We have deployed additional Border Force staff and sniffer dogs in northern France as well as bolstering screening checks at Dover for both tourist and freight vehicles.\" The Port of Dover Police is a non-Home Office constabulary funded entirely by the port authority, Dover Harbour Board. Port of Dover Police is not responsible for border security, which is down to the Border Agency and Kent Police frontier operations.",
        "However, it said the girls abducted from a school in Chibok in April 2014 were not among them. The military said the girls and women were freed during major operations ending in the seizure of four Boko Haram camps in the Sambisa Forest. A military spokesman said they were now being interviewed. Weapons were also seized at the camps taken in the latest operation, the military said. In recent months Nigerian security forces have taken back most of the territory previously under the control of Boko Haram, the BBC's Tomi Oladipo reports from Lagos. Gen Chris Olukolade said the hostages were freed as part of a major, ongoing operation. He said accurate intelligence had helped the military locate the camps, which had been attacked from all directions by ground and air forces. Last October, the government said it had secured an agreement for a ceasefire and the release of the girls taken from Chibok, but Boko Haram subsequently denied this. The abduction of the girls in Chibok sparked global outrage with many joining a campaign online to free them using the hashtag BringBackOurGirls. Several nations including the US and China vowed to help find them and there have been reported sightings of the girls, but none has been found to date. Meanwhile, the government of neighbouring Niger gave more details about fighting between its troops and Boko Haram on an island in Lake Chad over the weekend. It says 28 civilians died when Boko Haram attacked Karamga island and that 46 of its troops died in the battle for the island, along with more than 150 militants. Reports in local media have given a much higher death toll for government forces. Boko Haram's insurgency, and the army campaign against it, have killed more than 15,500 people since 2012. The violence has recently spread to neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon.",
        "There is an armed police presence at the Donington Park rock music festival in Leicestershire in the wake of the London and Manchester terror attacks. Senior officers have been encouraging fans to still engage with police and are using the hashtag \"copaselfie.\" Thousands of fans watched American metal band System of a Down end the first day of the festival on Friday. A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said posing for selfies with armed officers was \"safe\" and they have had an \"amazingly positive response\" from the public. Supt Martyn Ball, from Leicestershire Police, said on Thursday that armed police would help make people feel \"safe and secure\" following the recent attacks. He added that some parents had been in touch saying their children were considering not going unless there were armed officers. However, he said this would not change the way the force interacted with revellers. Downloadcops, which post messages to help fans at the festival, tweeted: \"PRTLeicsSgt with a gentleman that just gave us a wonderful poetry rendition. Sgt Waft is now taking on the night shift. Enjoy.\" Leicester City Cops also tweeted: \"Hello from the cops at DL2017, please don't hesitate to come over, say hello! copaselfie with us! Download.\" About 80,000 people are expected at Download over the weekend. The festival, held at Donington Park in Leicestershire since 2003, has hosted some of the biggest names in rock including Iron Maiden and Motorhead. Organiser Andy Copping said Download was the \"biggest\" of its type in the world. He told The Beat programme, broadcast on BBC Local Radio, that Download was also the \"friendliest.\" Biffy Clyro are headlining the main stage on Saturday night and Aerosmith, who are said to be performing for the last time in the UK, are the top act on Sunday.",
        "Patients often die before their 40s as mucus clogs and damages their lungs and leaves them prone to infection. A major trial on 1,108 patients, in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed a combination of drugs could bypass the genetic errors that cause the disease and may increase life expectancy. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust said it could \"improve the lives of many.\" One in every 2,500 babies in the UK has cystic fibrosis. Errors in sufferers' DNA - inherited from their parents - damage the microscopic machinery that controls salt and water levels in the linings of the lungs. The result is a thick mucus that inexorably damages the lungs. Antibiotics help prevent infection and drugs can loosen the mucus, but nothing deals with the fundamental problem for most patients. The combination of drugs - lumacaftor and ivacaftor - were designed to repair that microscopic machinery. The trial showed that those patients given the cocktail for 24 weeks had better lung function. Cystic fibrosis also affects the mucus lining in the gut so the doctors were pleased to see the patients also gained weight in the trial. Prof Stuart Elborn, who led the European part of the trial from Queen's University Belfast, told the BBC News website: \"This is very exciting and it really demonstrates that we can correct the basic defects in cystic fibrosis. \"This is likely to become a fundamental treatment for cystic fibrosis. \"Starting in children may prevent the disease process developing if we correct the basic defect early in life. \"Will this improve survival for people with cystic fibrosis? We would anticipate it would have a really good chance of doing that, but we don't know for sure yet.\" There are however, many types of error in the DNA that can culminate in cystic fibrosis. This treatment combination should work on around half of patients, while one of the drugs on its own corrects a small proportion of errors. New treatments are still required for the remaining patients. Susanna McColley, professor of paediatrics at Northwestern University, said these were \"groundbreaking findings\" that showed the future of treating cystic fibrosis. She told the BBC: \"For subjects I've cared for, they felt better in ways that are not necessarily measurable. \"One young woman said, and this is a direct quote, her CF'is not a problem'.\" Janet Allen, the director of research at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust charity, said: \"These results open up a new front in the fight against cystic fibrosis and this combination therapy looks set to be an important additional treatment option that could improve the lives of many. \"As this leading edge of science continues to be explored and better understood, we are hopeful that a future of personalised medicines is increasingly within reach.\" The therapy is being examined by regulators around the world.",
        "The 27-year-old will not need surgery after breaking his leg in an innocuous clash with Reds winger Raheem Sterling. Latics boss Roberto Martinez said: \"It is not as bad as it could have been.\" Watson, who spent two nights at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, has now returned home to begin his recovery and will wear a cast for a few weeks. The club are optimistic he will be able to resume training in the new year. Martinez added: \"It's still a very serious injury and we need to ensure that Ben is given all the time that he needs to make a full recovery. \"The good news is that he won't be out for as long as we initially thought and, with the character that Ben has, he will be able to deal with such an injury.\" Former England Under-21 international Watson collapsed to the Anfield turf clutching his right leg shortly after the half-hour mark of Saturday's Premier League match. But he waved away the help of a stretcher and limped off with the support of Wigan medical staff. Watson, who joined from Crystal Palace in a PS2m deal almost four years ago, had been in and out of the side this season but had started the last three Premier League games.

I didn't seek this job,\" he told the conservative website Independent Journal Review (IJR) during his recent visit to Asia. \"My wife told me I'm supposed to do this.\" In the wide-ranging interview, Mr Tillerson said he had been due to retire this month after spending more than 40 years at oil giant Exxon Mobil. He turns 65 on Thursday. \"I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids,\" he added in the interview, as he returned to the US from Beijing. Mr Tillerson said he had never met Donald Trump before his election in November. When he was invited for a conversation with the then president-elect, he thought they would talk \"about the world\" given his experiences at the oil company, he added. \"When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned.\" Mr Tillerson then gave the news to his wife, Renda St Clair, who said: \"I told you God's not through with you.\" He added: \"My wife convinced me. She was right. I'm supposed to do this.\" It was Mr Tillerson's first interview since he took office and correspondents say he has so far kept a low profile at the state department. He came under criticism after the state department press corps was not taken along with him on his trip to Asia. The IJR's Erin McPike was the only reporter allowed to travel with him. The state department said this was because of the size of the plane. But in the interview Mr Tillerson said: \"I'm not a big media press access person. I personally don't need it. \"I understand it's important to get the message of what we're doing out, but I also think there's only a purpose in getting the message out when there's something to be done.\" Mr Tillerson has also been criticised for his close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But when the subject came up in the interview, the IJR said: \"He was so cagey when Russia came up, for example, that his answer wasn't even worthy of inclusion.\"",
        "Huddersfield had the better of the first-half chances, and Michael Hefele could have given them the lead when he headed wide from Aaron Mooy's corner. But the Owls took the lead shortly after the break, Wallace smashing into the top corner from 30 yards out. Town's Jack Payne was shown a straight red card, before Fernando Forestieri tapped in for Wednesday late on. Moments earlier striker Sam Winnall, who joined the Owls from Barnsley on Friday, had been denied a debut goal by Terriers goalkeeper Danny Ward. But Callum McManaman rounded the on-loan Liverpool player, before Forestieri flicked his effort into the net to extend the Owls' winning run against Huddersfield to four consecutive league games. Carlos Carvalhal's side are now sixth in the table, just one point behind Town and five clear of seventh-placed Derby. Huddersfield remain level on points with fourth-placed Reading, having seen an eight-match unbeaten run in all competitions come to an end. Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal: \"It was an amazing goal from Wallace, a typical Ross Wallace goal. He deserved this goal. We gave him permission to fly and he flew to a fantastic goal. \"I didn't see the red card, I was too far away. I think Forestieri should have been given a penalty though. \"Winnall really affected the game, he's a good player and made a big impact, just like McManaman. When we win, we win together. \"I am very happy with the fans today. We felt they were with us even when the first half wasn't going our way.\" Huddersfield head coach David Wagner: \"We were more dangerous in the first half but we were not clinical enough today. You have to use your opportunities. \"Three big decisions went against us; Nahki Wells was fouled in the build-up to the first goal, the red card was harsh and Forestieri might have been offside for the second goal. \"I think we shouldn't forget where we are today, against one of the best teams in the division. \"The first half was very good but the second half was only okay.

        "Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said a suspected bookmaker had approached two Sri Lankan players ahead of the match to try to convince them to under-perform and lose the match. Both players turned down the approach and the authorities were informed, Mr Jayasekara said. Sri Lanka went on to win the game. Wicketkeeper Kusal Perera and bowler Rangana Herath were approached shortly before the match in Galle, Sri Lanka, in October, the minister said. \"After Kusal turned down the offer, the man approached Herath who also rejected the offer and alerted the authorities,\" he added. Both a police inquiry and anti-corruption investigation by Sri Lanka Cricket have been launched. The International Cricket Council has also been informed.",
        "Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates. Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. \"Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest ... is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,\" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. \"Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual SwissItalian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,\" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says \"the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. \"There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,\" he told BBC Sport. \"For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. \"For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all.\" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. \"Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,\" Bility wrote. \"If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down ... with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes.\" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.",
        "Susan O'Brien QC has said those giving evidence must have experienced abuse no later than 17 December 2014. Furthermore, the QC wants any group which wants to express how the inquiry should proceed to make their views known by 31 January next year. Survivors' groups have previously criticised a lack of progress in the work of the Scottish inquiry. The probe - established in October after its initial announcement in December, 2014 - will cover abuse within living memory up to 17 December, 2014. It will examine abuse of children in care and the effects of abuse on children and their families. The inquiry will also examine the extent of failures of bodies with legal responsibility to protect children in care, whether such failures have been addressed, and if further changes are needed. Ms O'Brien said: \"We are developing procedures to take the evidence of survivors, as it is likely that many individuals will apply to give us their testimony. \"We are considering how best to assess the evidence from victimssurvivors and all the other evidence the inquiry receives. We also require to determine which of the witnesses will remain anonymous.\" The inquiry will have statutory powers to compel witnesses to give evidence. It will also examine any instance where a child was abused at institutions including residential care provided by faith-based organisations, children's homes, secure care and those placed in foster care.",
        "Alex Hartley took 4-24 and Katherine Brunt 3-35 as the hosts were bowled out for 155, despite captain Stafanie Taylor's 57. England looked tense at 56-2 in the chase, but Nat Sciver's unbeaten 58 saw them home with 67 balls to spare. The victory means England are one win away from World Cup qualification. That could - and should - be achieved on the tour of Sri Lanka in November, when England will play three matches in the ICC Women's Championship. Not only have Heather Knight's side moved a step closer to booking a place in the home tournament in 2017, they have secured an impressive series victory in her first overseas tour in charge. Without wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor, who remains on a break from the game to deal with an anxiety problem, and injured pace bowler Anya Shrubsole, they have beaten the World Twenty20 champions in hot, humid conditions and on slow, spin-friendly surfaces. It is those conditions that have made run-scoring so difficult and the toss so important - in all four previous matches the side batting first had gone on to win. England again had to field first, albeit the later sunshine made batting easier in the afternoon, and their bowlers ensured the run-chase would be manageable. After Brunt and Georgia Elwiss removed Shaquana Quintyne and Hayley Matthews respectively, Hartley and fellow spinner Laura Marsh got to work on the middle order. With Marsh providing the squeeze from one end, Hartley's accuracy induced poor strokes from Deandra Dottin, Merissa Aguilleira and Shemaine Campbelle. Taylor once again held the innings together with her third half-century in the five matches, but when she was stumped it gave Hartley a 13th wicket of the series, an England record in ODIs. With Brunt and off-spinner Knight running through the lower order, West Indies lost their last five wickets for 24 runs. England were in a strong position chasing 224 in the fourth ODI, only to give away five run-outs in a 42-run defeat. Here, they were restricted by West Indies' spinners early on, Lauren Winfield chipping Matthews to mid-wicket for 12 and Tammy Beaumont caught and bowled by Afy Fletcher for 34. With tension rising, the hosts threatened to find a way back into the match, especially with Knight dropped by Anisa Mohammed at short fine leg on only three. But the skipper combined with Sciver to reverse the pressure, scoring freely down the ground and, at one point, adding 26 runs in three overs. Though Knight was caught behind off impressive leg-spinner Fletcher, Sciver found an ally in the busy Danielle Wyatt on the way to her sixth ODI half-century. Wyatt was brilliantly caught at long-on by Britney Cooper, and Elwiss was bowled by Dottin, but there was to be no England wobble, with Amy Jones hitting the runs that sealed the series. England head coach Mark Robinson told BBC Sport: \"It's absolutely outstanding. We've had it tough. It's been ever so humid, red hot, and the wickets have been massively challenging. \"We've come to their back yard, they were on a high after winning the World T20 and we've shown a lot of character. I'm really proud of them. \"Hartley is a tough cookie. She doesn't shy from hard work and she's bowled outstandingly. She's got a big future if she keeps working hard. \"We're a young team and we're learning as we go. We feel we're going in the right direction and we feel we have shown everybody what we're made of.\" Ex-England batter Lydia Greenway on BBC Test Match Special: \"England have shown a huge amount of character. Everyone in this series has played their part. \"There have been little turning points in individuals' careers, like Lauren Winfield playing consistently. \"A sign of a good team is showing consistency in all different kinds of situations and I'm sure they will want to carry that on when they go to Sri Lanka.\"",
        "When Google paid 3.2bn (PS2.1bn) to buy Tony Fadell's start-up Nest in 2014, it got much more than just an internet-connected thermostat and smoke detector. It got the man dubbed the \"the iPod's father\" - the engineerdesigner who sold Steve Jobs on his vision of a portable music player, and then worked alongside Jony Ive to build it, update it and then repeat the process with the iPhone. Now, the two men are set to go head-to-head. First with wearable tech, and then later, perhaps, with competing car designs - more of which later. Tellingly, Mr Fadell reveals he recently started testing Sir Jonathan's latest product, the Apple Watch, although he was not wearing it at the time of interview. \"I've had mine for about two weeks now,\" he says. \"I think they did a tremendous job on the hardware components of it. \"They are trying many different things with that platform - some are going to be great, and some are not.\" When Mr Fadell agreed to sell Nest to Google, the reason he gave was that joining forces would accelerate his \"thoughtful home\" master plan - he hates the term \"internet of things,\" which he says does a \"disservice\" to his products. But in January, it became clear that Google's chief executive, Larry Page, had wider uses for his hardware expertise, and the troubled Glass computer was added to his duties. \"It wasn't handed to me and said,'Tony clean it up, Mr Fadell clarifies, \"I offered.\" \"I remember what it was like when we did the iPod and the iPhone. I think this can be that important, but it's going to take time to get it right.\" The 1,500 (PS965) \"explorer edition\" of Glass was soon pulled from sale, and Mr Fadell made clear that future test versions would be kept in-house. That was widely seen as a shift in strategy for Google - a company that took five years to take its Gmail service out of \"beta\" status, and that still invites users to \"play\" with preview versions of other products. Moreover, it caused anger among developers who had sunk time and money into making apps for a product that no longer existed. But Mr Fadell defends the shift, saying a distinction needed to be drawn between hardware and software. \"If you are only doing services based on electrons, you can iterate quickly, test it, and modify it and get it right,\" he says. \"But when you are dealing with actual atoms - hardware - and you have to get manufacturing lines and it takes a year or more to develop that product, you better understand what it is and what it's trying to do and specifically what it's not going to do. \"Customers have to spend money to buy those atoms. \"They want something that delivers value or you end up with a real disappointment and you can spoil the market.\" For now, that leaves Mr Fadell's reputation dependent on his Nest line-up. It is limited to three products, including the recently launched Nest Cam. The motion-detecting camera streams live footage and sound from the owner's home to an app and can save memorable moments in the cloud. If you get over the creepiness factor of effectively spying on your family, it's fair to say the device shares the crisp, stylish look of the Nest's other products, and reviews have been positive. But the camera is actually an upgrade to an earlier device made by Dropcam - a company Nest acquired. That means Mr Fadell's division has not created a new product category of its own since joining Google. Bearing in mind, Mr Page told him to \"keep doing what you're doing, and do it as fast as you possibly can,\" it raises the question: what's taking so long? \"Talk to me about the number of home product companies who have come out with three different product categories in less than five years.... are shipping and they are the number ones in their category,\" says Mr Fadell, slightly bristling. \"I would love to have more, faster. \"But it takes time - it really takes time to make these products to the level of design and near-perfection that we achieve.\" He adds that Nest's biggest goal right now is to expand the range of third-party products its devices talk to - for example its Thermostats can switch LG fridges into energy-saving mode when no-one's in, and its Protect sensors can make Philip's Hue lights flash red if they detect smoke or carbon monoxide. But such advances have less impact than a new product. \"Despite his substantial success to date and involvement in key products such as Apple iPod, Mr Fadell has arguably not yet reached the truly iconic status bestowed upon Jonathan Ive,\" Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight, says. \"Given the huge amount Google invested in the acquisition of Nest to secure his services there must be an expectation that he too can deliver his own portfolio of truly disruptive devices with mass appeal. \"Google still lacks a smash-hit consumer electronics device of its own - it would be sensible to assume it hopes Mr Fadell can deliver that missing element.\" The two men worked together on first iPods and iPhones, but are credited with different achievements. With the iPod, Mr Fadell first convinced Steve Jobs of the wisdom of developing a portable music player and then worked out how to incorporate a hard drive - a fragile component - into a device that could be thrown about, sat on and generally abused. Jony Ive's breakthrough was his design of its thumb-wheel, which scrolled through songs more rapidly as it was spun more quickly. With the iPhone, perhaps Mr Fadell's greatest feat was finding a way to shrink the tech necessary to offer a multi-touch user interface on a handheld device. Jony Ive's skill was best summed up by one writer as making the final product look almost more like \"a piece of jewellery than a gadget.\" In post-Jobs Apple, Sir Jonathan's influence has grown further - extending to the look of the company's operating system software, the creation of its Watch and even the design of its new headquarters. By contrast, Mr Fadell has thrived beyond - building and selling a multi-billion dollar company, reinventing mundane household devices as desirable gadgets, and becoming one of Google's key figures. This leads to thoughts about whether Mr Fadell could become involved in other Google projects. A question about working on its growing roster of robots is rebuffed on the grounds that they are still a long way from leaving the lab. But self-driving cars, he adds, are much closer to launch and a \"big curiosity.\" \"I don't think you've seen anything of what the design of the car could look like when it first materialises,\" he says. \"How do you make those occupants feel like they are safe and make sure they are safe? \"How does the car exude safety [and be] fashionable as well? \"How does this'utility' self-driving car also be a reflection of you, right, as well as itself and also be transparent about its safety? \"Those are very interesting questions that still need to be dealt with.\" He adds that he has \"some thoughts\" about the answers and is sharing them with others involved in Google's self-driving car project. \"We are having discussion about them all the time,\" he says. \"I always have ideas - it's whether or not people want to hear them.\" So, nothing official yet. But it would not be a surprise if Google eventually announces Mr Fadell is adding automobile design to his list of duties. And if, as rumoured, Sir Jonathan and his team are also working on their own electric car concept, that could set up a fascinating clash between the two former colleagues in the future.",
        "Fuel pods were left at the junction of Cumsons Road and Tullygeasy Road. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency said the waste will be removed with no harm to the environment. Ulster Unionist Councillor David Taylor said there was despair and palpable anger within the local community over the incident. \"This problem is now of epidemic proportion within the south Armagh area and the locations chosen by those individuals carrying out this crime, who I have no doubt have clear links to republican paramilitary elements, are very sinister indeed,\" he said. \"The incident in question at Cumsons Road saw the perpetrators of this crime visit the scene twice overnight to dump the fuel pods highlighting their clear disregard for those living nearby or indeed to the lawful authorities. \"As I have stated previously there is a clear desire for a co-ordinated effort to be initiated between all the relevant legal agencies to stamp out this illegal activity.\"",
        "Thomas Buckett, now 21, fell 15ft (4.5m) through a skylight at Clayton Hall Business and Language College, Staffordshire, in May 2010. He shattered one side of his skull and was in a critical condition for two weeks. A compensation claim launched by his family was thrown out on Monday. Judge Main QC heard Mr Buckett had been left with \"a legacy of significant physical, intellectual and behavioural dysfunction\" but found that the injuries \"arose directly from his own actions.\" He heard Mr Buckett was part of a group of youths that had earlier broken into the college and engaged in \"vandalism, criminal damage and dishonest criminal behaviour,\" including stealing items from the tuck shop. The judge, sitting at Telford County Court, concluded the group had moved on to explore part of the roof and Mr Buckett had probably jumped down on to the skylight, \"thinking it would hold his weight and not with the intention of breaking it.\" While criticising a Staffordshire County Council risk assessment and saying such a trespass incident should have been foreseen, Judge Main found in favour of the authority and dismissed the claim. The Buckett family has declined to comment. Their solicitors described the judge's ruling as \"extremely disappointing.\" Dianne Yates, partner at Birchall Blackburn Law, said the judge had dismissed legal arguments in respect to the \"criminal behaviour,\" but had not been able to award damages due to case law. \"Thomas has suffered life-changing injuries and the family is now looking at how they can ensure he has sufficient care going forward,\" she said. In a statement, Staffordshire County Council described it as a \"terrible incident\" that had \"a profound and life-changing impact on Thomas and his family.\" \"However, our decision to defend this case was about fairness to the taxpayer,\" council chief executive John Tradewell said. He said it was not fair for public money to be used for compensation under these circumstances. \"The county council will continue to help Thomas access the care and support he needs to live as fulfilling a life as possible.\" The family was ordered to pay PS150,000 costs.",
        "BBC Sport takes a look at five things you might have missed in the EFL on the last full match day before the festive season. There were six late winning goals in the Championship on Saturday, all with ramifications in the race for promotion and the bid to avoid relegation. Brighton's Glenn Murray headed home in the fifth minute of stoppage time against Birmingham City to ensure the Seagulls will spend Christmas eight points clear of third-placed Reading. Jaap Stam's men had looked like having to settle for a point at Blackburn before George Evans hit an injury-time winner to move them back up to third. Yorkshire rivals Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday ensured they would spend Christmas in the top six thanks to winners in the 89th minute and stoppage time against Brentford and Rotherham respectively. Meanwhile, 23rd-placed Wigan were set to take a point from their home game against Ipswich before David McGoldrick popped up with an 88th-minute winner for Mick McCarthy's men. Match of the day in the second tier must go to Barnsley's 4-3 win at Cardiff. The Bluebirds led in the third minute before trailing 3-1 at half-time. Peter Whittingham and Antony Pilkington's 89th-minute strike seemed to have given Neil Warnock's side an unlikely point but Ryan Williams scored in the fifth minute of injury time to make it a happy journey back to South Yorkshire for the Tykes. Well, maybe not quite miracles but it's probably fair to say neither Wes Brown nor Isaiah Osbourne would have been fancied by many to get on the scoresheet today. Former Manchester United and Sunderland man Brown, 37, scored on his Blackburn Rovers debut to level the match against the Royals. It counted for nothing in the end thanks to Reading's late winner but it was Brown's first goal since netting for Sunderland in December 2011. Walsall midfielder Osbourne only had to wait a shade over three years to end his scoring drought. The ex-Aston Villa player opened his account for the Saddlers to give them a point against Bradford City. He'll probably be pleased this goal meant a little more than his last one which opened the scoring for Blackpool against Derby in December 2013. The Rams went on to win 5-1. Yeovil boss Darren Way, assistant Terry Skiverton and the 18-strong match-day squad put PS300 behind the bar at Carlisle as a'thank you' to fans for making the long trek north. \"Special mention must go to the supporters because how far they've travelled to watch this game is unbelievable commitment,\" Way told BBC Somerset. \"This is beyond the end of the Earth. I just hope they feel that the players gave everything and they can be proud of their team.\" Travelling Glovers fans certainly seemed appreciative as they tweeted the club with pictures of pies and pints. Sadly for the 96 Yeovil fans who made the 660-mile round trip to Brunton Park, the hosts were not in such a generous mood, with the Cumbrians claiming a 2-1 win. Roll the clock back to 27 September and Bury are celebrating their sixth league win of the season and sit second in League One. The following 16 games have brought a sum total of zero victories and the Shakers have slumped into the relegation zone. David Flitcroft was sacked after presiding over seven consecutive league defeats but replacement Chris Brass, given the job until the end of the season on Thursday, has fared little better, losing his first five matches. Bury twice took the lead at home to Oxford on Saturday but were pegged back on each occasion by a Chris Maguire free-kick before a Greg Leigh own goal gave the U's victory. \"We've got to dig in and fight a little bit harder than we are right now to keep the ball out of the net,\" Brass told BBC Radio Manchester. It's been a tough start to the season for Exeter City and their match-going regulars. Going into today's game against Mansfield, the Grecians had claimed a healthy seven wins away from home but were the only team in the EFL yet to taste success on their own turf. Paul Tisdale's side ended their wait for a win at St James Park, which dated back to April, with a 2-0 win over the Stags thanks to a double from Ollie Watkins. \"I'm delighted,\" Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon. \"It had to come at some point and we did it today. It was hard work and the boys have deserved it against a really strong team. \"They put us under pressure in the second half and in many respects outplayed us but we stuck to it and 2-0 is a great feeling.\" Take part in our new Premier League Predictor game, which allows you to create leagues with friends.",

        "Carr died in Los Angeles after complications from a rare form of dementia, her representative said. In her role in the 1965 film, she famously performed the song Sixteen Going on Seventeen. After leaving the film industry, Carr ran an interior design firm in California. Her mother had arranged for her to audition for the role, although she had had no singing or acting lessons. Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music was a massive hit, at the time surpassing Gone with the Wind as the highest-grossing film of all time. Carr later wrote two books on her experience - Forever Liesl and Letters to Liesl - and frequently appeared at events commemorating the movie. Her only other major role was in the Stephen Sondheim television musical Evening Primrose. Many fans of The Sound of Music took to Twitter to post their memories, clipping up sections of her performance.

        "The list is a countdown of the year's most popular songs voted for by listeners of the alternative music station. Triple J said there were \"a whole range of reasons\" behind the decision. The main one is a social media campaign, originally instigated by Buzzfeed Australia's Mark Di Stefano, to get Shake It Off on the list. Readers were encouraged to tweet Tay4Hottest100 to get the song to appear on the countdown, which was thought to be too much of an influence. Some thought Swift's track was too commercial for the alternative music station, while others said banning the song would be seen as elitism. The list was topped by Chet Faker's Talk Is Cheap, with Peking Duk's High and Cosby Sweater by Hilltop Hoods completing the top three. Mark Ronson's Uptown Funk finished sixth on the poll, while alt-J have three songs in the top 30. Triple J pointed out that Taylor Swift wasn't played at all on the station in 2014 but would have finished ahead of all alt-J's tracks if it wasn't disqualified. Vance Joy's Riptide won the 2013 poll, which saw a more commercial top three include Lorde's Royals and Get Lucky by Daft Punk.

The 24-year-old then texted his solicitor to request a postponement. \"Tell him to go easy on the paella and cerveza because his fines are going up,\" said the judge. Judge Barney McElholm asked what was to stop Mr Moore dropping his driving licences in to his solicitor office before going on holiday. \"I will expect to see him in court in three weeks' time with his driving licence and glowing with a tan,\" said the judge.

        "Ministers are looking to limit access to benefits, health care and housing when freedom to work controls on Romanians and Bulgarians end. The detail of how changes might differ from current rules is not yet clear. Downing Street said the curbs were being considered in response to \"widespread public concern.\" The PM's official spokesman said there was particular concern about the pressure created by migrants on local services, housing and the health service. He declined to give any details about specific measures, or say whether the government was poised to introduce an \"entitlement card\" to limit access to the health service. The measures would be announced in due course, he said. BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the government was drawing up a package of measures designed to bring the UK into line with policies in other European member states already deemed legal by the European Court of Justice. Councils will be urged to use new powers to give priority on council house waiting lists to those with local connections - whether born, educated or with relatives in their area - which could make it harder for outsiders to get housing. Ministers are also examining the possibility of linking some benefits to contributions, which would have the effect of excluding new arrivals from eligibility. On Sunday, Foreign Secretary William Hague told the BBC people should not be attracted to the UK just by the benefits available and \"benefit tourism\" had to end. He said ministers wanted to remove \"artificial, perverse incentives\" to come to the UK. One immigration pressure group estimates 50,000 people will move to the UK every year from Romania and Bulgaria once the movement restrictions expire at the end of the year, but Mr Hague said any attempt to estimate the number would be \"guesswork.\" People from Romania and Bulgaria have been free to live in the UK and anywhere else in the EU since the countries joined the EU in 2007, but in the UK they have either had to apply for one of the limited work permits available, be self-employed, or work in specific jobs such as seasonal agricultural or as domestic servants. Under EU rules, these temporary restrictions must come to an end at the beginning of 2014, after which Romanian and Bulgarian migrants will have the same rights to live and work in the UK as those of other EU countries, which will give them access to benefits and the NHS. Ministers say the impact of the temporary work restrictions, and the fact that eight other EU countries are also ending their restrictions at the same time as the UK, make forecasting the number of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants who might come to the UK difficult. When the first wave of former East European states joined the EU in 2004, the UK was one of just three existing members that did not bring in any temporary work restrictions - instead the UK introduced a Worker Registration Scheme to prevent \"benefit tourism\" by EU migrants coming to the UK for less than a year and claiming benefits. For Labour, shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said: \"Managing immigration in a fair way is really important. Yet what we are getting from the Government is just an unseemly reaction to threats from their backbenches. \"In a panicked reaction to Eastleigh they are briefing anything and everything they can think of that they are looking at for the future, instead of properly considered, substantive and deliverable proposals that work for everyone.\"",
        "\"This will give all European Leagues total freedom to schedule their matches as they see fit,\" said the European Professional Football Leagues group. The agreement ended on 15 March. It had been in place between the EPFL and Uefa to boost attendances and television viewing figures for European matches. Arsenal's FA Cup replay against Hull City in March 2016 was given special dispensation to be played on the same night as the Champions League last 16. Manchester City hosted Stoke City in a rearranged Premier League fixture last month on the same night as the Champions League last-16 ties between Barcelona and Paris St-Germain, and Borussia Dortmund and Benfica. The Premier League said the scheduling of the match on Wednesday, 8 March was \"unavoidable,\" it was reported. It was also reported in April 2013 that the Football Association was fined PS1.1m for allowing domestic matches to be played on the same night as European games. The EPFL said it will hold a general assembly of its member leagues in Geneva on 6 June.",

Prior to the deal being finalised, Nicholson had said he was unsure what it meant for his own future. \"They have got to show that they are in it for all the right reasons, and they assure me that they are,\" the 36-year-old told BBC Radio Devon. \"I spoke to them very openly and honestly, making them aware their takeover has not been overly positively taken (among fans). They're aware of that. \"These guys have got a lot to prove but they have technically saved Torquay United right now.\" Nicholson, who has been in charge since September 2015, continued: \"They've got to gain the trust of thousands of Torquay fans.\" \"We're going to sit down and put together a five-year plan and then we're going to hold a forum as soon as possible so that these fans that are worried can come in.\" Torquay are currently 17th in the table, and play Forest Green Rovers at home on Boxing Day, before a trip to Gloucestershire for the return game to start the new year.",

        "The petition.parliament.uk site is designed to help people get issues on the political agenda and open up a \"new dialogue\" with MPs and ministers. E-petitions will initially be considered by a cross-party committee of MPs chaired by Labour's Helen Jones. The first e-petition tabled called for increased taxes on foreigners buying UK property worth more than PS3.5m. Under the previous system, petitions were directed to government departments rather than MPs, with 10,000 signatures required for an official response and 100,000 needed for a petition to be considered for a debate in Parliament. More than 40 petitions passed the 100,000 signature threshold during the last Parliament. A number of them were subsequently debated in Parliament although critics say not enough of them were given parliamentary airtime. The thresholds for a petition getting a response or being considered for a debate have not changed in the revamp of the old website which launched in 2011. The new site will be jointly run by the House of Commons and the government. The Petitions Committee, made up of 11 MPs from different parties, said it would enable every British citizen and UK resident to start or a sign a petition electronically. The committee, whose creation was recommended in a report by MPs last December, said its role was to liaise with petitioners, seek information from government about issues raised and, in some cases, refer petitions to specialist parliamentary committees. \"First and foremost, it is an easy way for people to let MPs and ministers know they care about,\" Ms Jones said. \"What's more, it gives us a chance to open up a new dialogue between the public and Parliament. I very much hope that the petitions committee will be able to bring forward issues that wouldn't otherwise have been debated or investigated in Parliament. \"For the most pressing petitions, we will be able to schedule debates...It is an exciting step for Parliament and a visible demonstration of its commitment to improving public engagement with what goes on here.\" Deputy Commons leader Therese Coffey said the new website would further improve public engagement with politics.",
        "Hurtling round the extremely dangerous 38-mile (61km) street course at an average speed of nearly 132mph (212kmh), takes immense skill and nerves of steel. But what makes him so much faster than many of his rivals on near identical bikes? Some of the sponsors of his Honda 1,000cc bike wanted to find out using the appliance of science. Data analytics firm EMC, sportswear maker Alpinestars, and sensor specialist Freescale Semiconductor, fitted his bike and suit with a battery of biometric and mechanical sensors to record every aspect of man and machine in action. \"It was a bit nerve-wracking - there were wires everywhere,\" the 43-year-old road-racing champion tells the BBC. \"There were even temperature sensors down my underpants. \"But once the visor's down you forget all about that.\" The team tested the technology at the Monteblanco circuit in Huelva, Spain, comparing McGuinness' performance against that of motorcycle journalist, Adam Child. Then they tested the kit in race conditions during June's Isle of Man TT race. The results were surprising, not least to McGuinness himself. Fifty sensors measured everything from front and rear wheel velocities to throttle usage; banking angles to gear changes; acceleration and braking rates to suspension travel. The sensors in his suit even allowed them to analyse his position on the bike at different points of the course. But it was the biometric sensors on McGuinness himself that revealed a lot about the racer's secret to success. It turns out that he really does have ice in his veins, figuratively speaking. Even bombing down roads at top speeds of over 200mph, his heart rate is much lower than might be expected. \"He was only at 120bpm [beats per minute] - well within the aerobic range - even at very high speeds,\" says Mike Foley, EMC's senior director of data science. \"As his heart rate was much lower, his oxygen intake was lower,\" he says. \"He was under less stress, calmer, and so more consistent in his performance, experiencing less fatigue than other riders.\" And tiredness leads to mistakes - sometimes fatal - in an intense time-trial race that lasts 1 hour 50 minutes around a course with 250 corners. \"I didn't really know why I was faster,\" says McGuinness, \"so it's been interesting finding out. \"I get nervous before a race starts, but I consciously try to relax myself so I don't get burnt out and lose concentration.\" The testing generated mounds of data, all of which needed analysing, says Mr Foley. It also revealed limitations in the sensors themselves - many failed in the harsh conditions of the Isle of Man. Unusually, EMC opened a global competition to see who could analyse and present all the collected data in the most imaginative and practical way. \"We crowd-sourced 750 data scientists,\" he says. \"We applied machine learning techniques to the data analysis and discovered that only 14 variables really made a difference during the race. \"It is the interplay of those 14 variables at any point on the lap that explains why he is faster.\" In short, this means he braked a little later, accelerated a little longer, and banked over in the corners a little more than other riders. He also used some gears more than others. \"A 1 change in banking angle can make a big difference,\" says Mr Foley. Of course, natural ability plays a big part, too, as does long experience. \"I first went on a motorbike at the age of three,\" he tells the BBC. \"My dad had a bike garage in Morecambe so it was two wheels for me as far back as I can remember.\" Racing was just a natural extension of his \"burning passion\" for motorbikes, he says. \"I loved the thrills, the speed, the freedom...and winning was the icing on the cake.\" So what did he learn from the data analysis? \"I learned that I can go even faster in a couple of areas on the track - the ones I don't enjoy as much. I get a little tense here and my heart rate goes up. \"So now I can clean myself up and make myself relaxed,\" he says. Formula 1 motor racing has had this kind of analysis for years, as has superbike Moto GP racing, with sensors beaming data wirelessly from the cars and bikes in real time during races. But the Auto-Cycle Union (ACU) Ltd., which runs the Isle of Man TT races, does not allow real-time data transmission - all the analysis of how the bikes have performed must be done after the races. \"We like to think of TT as a purer form of racing - the rider has the responsibility for what he is doing, not the technical guys,\" explains Dr Paul King, chair of the ACU's road race committee. But Mr King, who is also a senior lecturer in mechanical engineering at Loughborough University, does believe in-suit biometrics could play an increasing role in motorsport and for civilian motorcyclists. \"There are all sorts of possibilities for smart sensor technology in motorcycle clothing,\" he says. \"Core body temperature is key on motorcycles - levels of concentration can drop if your body gets too cold. \"You could receive an alert - a vibration in the seat perhaps - if this happens and you get too sleepy, for example.\" John McGuinness agrees, saying: \"All this data we're gathering could be useful in the real world - sensors measuring your fatigue levels, the state of your tyres, whether you have an oil leak - it could save lives.\" Meanwhile, McGuinness aims to beat the late Joey Dunlop's record of 26 Isle of Man TT wins. With the help of data analytics, he might just succeed. Follow Matthew on Twitter: matthewwall",
        "Detentions by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency jumped to 41,318 between January 22 of this year and the end of April. That was up from 30,028 arrests in about the same period last year. The dragnet follows presidential orders widening the scope of who can be targeted for immigration violations. Almost two-thirds of those arrested this year had criminal convictions, said ICE. But more than half the increase in arrests was of immigrants who had committed no crime other than being in the US without permission. President Donald Trump has stepped up immigration enforcement to target such undocumented immigrants. Acting director of ICE Thomas Homan said on a call on Wednesday with reporters that immigrants who pose a threat to national security or have criminal records are still a priority for his agency. But he added: \"There is no category of aliens off the table.\" ICE will continue to target people who have been issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge, even if they have not committed another crime, he vowed. \"Those that enter the country illegally, they do violate the law, that is a criminal act,\" acting director of ICE Thomas Homan said on the call. \"When a federal judge makes a decision and issues an order that order needs to mean something,\" Mr Homan said. President Barack Obama was also criticised for deporting a large number of immigrants, but most of them were recent illegal border crossers. President Trump's signature campaign pledge to build an expanded wall on the US-Mexico border is in limbo after Congress denied funding for it in a recent budget deal. But his tough rhetoric on border security appears to be having an impact on immigration enforcement. The number of people caught crossing the border with Mexico is down significantly since the beginning of the year, according US Customs and Border Protection data. Immigration advocates have raised concerns about the stepped up enforcement in the interior of the country.",
        "The former Hearts captain recently left Leeds, having moved to Elland Road last summer despite a trial at Rangers. \"I'm excited to come here from Leeds and on the first day it felt like it was the right decision,\" Zaliukas told the club's website. \"It's a brilliant stadium and it's going to be fun to play here.\" Zaliukas played more than 200 times for Hearts over seven years, but made just 15 appearances for Leeds last term. His first competitive match for Rangers could be against Hibs in the Challenge Cup on 5 August. The Ibrox outfit's first Scottish Championship fixture of the campaign is against Hearts at Ibrox on 10 August. \"I think the Championship is going to be a very interesting league because Hearts and Hibs are in here, and even Falkirk and Queen of the South are going to be tough teams,\" the 30-year-old added. \"I think our squad could compete straight away in the Premiership, everyone is experienced and top players.

        "The body will also be responsible for the registration and regulation of youth support workers and work-based learning practitioners. They join more than 75,000 school and further education teachers and learning support staff on the national register. The council's chief executive Hayden Llewellyn said regulating all these groups was a \"world-first for Wales.\" He added it was \"a bold and welcome step.\" \"By bringing non-formal and in-work education in line with formal education, we are enhancing the status of the often overlooked professions of youth work and work-based learning and the increasingly important role they play in young people's wellbeing and education,\" Mr Llewellyn said. Keith Towler, chairman of CWVYS (Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services), said good quality youth work \"saves young lives.\" \"The trusted relationship between young people and youth workers and youth support workers is vital for the development of resilience, self-esteem and delivery of professional responses to a huge range of issues,\" Mr Towler said. \"Recognition of informal and non-formal learning in a wider educational context is important and this will support the development of quality youth work provision.\" Julie James, minister for skills and science, said the new registration system \"supports our ambition to achieve the highest possible professional standards throughout the whole education sector and it will provide a vital component in ensuring the people of Wales receive high quality learning throughout their lives.\"",
        "Mandy Fader, professor of continence technology at the University of Southampton, says their design has changed \"very little\" in 80 years. In the BBC News website's Scrubbing Up column, she criticises low investment from industry and \"weak\" regulation The Urology Trade Association says it is \"simply incorrect\" to say catheters have not improved in recent decades. The urinary catheter is a much-used, but little-discussed, device designed to drain the bladder. It is typically used in hospital to monitor how much urine patients have passed, or to make sure the bladder does not become too full. This can be for a matter of minutes - but some people are discharged with a catheter, and may continue to use one for months or even years. The tube is usually passed through the urethra and held in the bladder with a small balloon, though sometimes it is put in above the pubic bone via the abdomen into the bladder. It is connected to a drainage bag which is usually strapped onto the thigh or above the ankle. This - in turn - must be drained regularly. The catheter provides a site for bacteria to multiply and thrive, encased in a glue called \"biofilm\" which is resistant to detergent and antibiotics. This is a major source or urinary infection, blockages and leaks. It is estimated in the UK there are at least 90,000 people with long term urinary catheters, using them for three months or more. About one in five people who stay in hospital are fitted with a catheter, sometimes just as a matter of routine rather than requirement. Research suggests more than one in four urinary catheters inserted in AE are unnecessary. This problem is being addressed in some hospitals. In a scheme to reduce Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI), five trusts in south London are working together to reduce harm in a scheme called \"No Catheter, No CAUTI.\" The campaign, run by the Health Innovation Network, aims to ensure catheters are not used inappropriately, and are removed promptly. It is hoped this will reduce these infections by 30 and, if it is successful, it will be rolled out across the NHS. Dr Adrian Hopper, the network's clinical director, said: \"The general view is that CAUTI is the most common hospital acquired infection and vastly more common than MRSA and C-difficile which are the infections that everyone knows about.\" Prof Fader says there is growing evidence that catheters are over-used, but the main concerns are about design and materials. She argues such a commonplace device should be a state of the art product, but concludes in her column that \"the lowly catheter has changed very little in the last 80 years.\" And Prof Fader warns part of the problem lies with weak regulation, saying: \"Unlike with new drugs, manufacturers do not need to show that any changes they make to catheters actually work on patients.\" She also criticises catheter manufacturers: \"What's needed is for industry to wake up and invest more heavily in new catheter designs and.... materials that resist infection.\" For too long the devices have been \"easy money,\" she warns - with demand remaining high \"without bothering with much innovation and improvement.\" But a spokesman for the UK health regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said there was a requirement that devices were designed and manufactured to minimise the risk of infection. He added: \"We have no evidence at this time to suggest that urinary catheter materials used in the UK do not meet the requirements of the Medical Device Directive.\" Chris Whitehouse, chairman of the Urology Trade Association, called Prof Fader's comments \"disappointing.\" \"Any suggestion that catheters haven't improved in 80 years is simply incorrect. \"Such an assertion ignores the efforts of manufacturers to develop catheters that meet patients' individual needs and that are safe, easy to use and discrete.\"",

        "The 36-year-old was sacked from his first managerial post at League One club Oldham in January after just 20 games in charge. Former midfielder Dunn, who won one England cap in 2002, joined Rovers aged eight and made 377 appearances in two spells at Ewood Park. \"I don't have to say how much this club means to me,\" he told the club website. \"I think everyone knows what Blackburn Rovers means to me personally. \"I'm looking forward to learning from the manager, as well as Alan Irvine and Rob Kelly who are some of the best coaches around.\" Meanwhile, Blackburn boss Paul Lambert has called for a winter break to be introduced into English football. The 46-year-old made five changes for the FA Cup loss to West Ham and then six changes for Wednesday's defeat by Derby as they have a run of 10 games in 32 days. \"I would have it,\" Lambert told BBC Radio Lancashire when asked about the break. \"I've experienced it and I know it's brilliant. \"It's really refreshing, you go away and you come back and you've done another pre-season. \"It gives everyone so much recovery from long-term injuries, for people mentally and it gives everyone a break.\"",

He added: \"It has been an honour to be the manager of Everton Football Club for the past three seasons.\" Everton reached the semi-final of both the FA Cup and League Cup this season but have only won five home league games and will finish with their lowest points tally at Goodison Park since the introduction of three points for a win in 1981. Martinez, 42, took over at Everton in 2013, finishing fifth in his first season but slipping to 11th last term. He added: \"I will treasure this period as Everton manager forever - the memories of reaching a club record 72 points tally in the Premier League, reaching the final 16 of the Europa League and the excitement of reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups this season. \"I express my gratitude to chairman Bill Kenwright, who understood and supported my vision and who gave me the privilege of becoming an Evertonian.\" Martinez offered his \"sincere thanks\" to the players and staff at the club. He added: \"I appreciate that over the last eight weeks our league results haven't been up to the levels that we would expect. However, over the past three years the support the fans have given to me and the team has been inspiring. \"I know that the team and the fans will react well against Norwich today and I wish everyone the best of luck for three points which would match last season's league points tally.\" Everton host Norwich in their final Premier League of the season on Sunday with current under-21s coach David Unsworth and former manager Joe Royle taking charge.

        "The sign reads \"JOBS.\" The backdrop to Mitt Romney's first rally in Ohio today is an artful suggestion of stripped-down, industrial virtue, made in the USA. When Romney appears, he talks big. Big changes. Big challenges. Big choices. A strategist tells me it is a deliberate contrast with what they say is President Barack Obama's \"small vision for the future.\" Before he appears, a prominent Romney surrogate, Senator Rob Portman, urges everyone at the rally to vote as soon as it ends. Now. Today. If those committed enough to come to a rally have already voted, they can spend their time getting other people to the polls or persuading them to vote, he says. In this, if only this, Republicans agree with President Obama, who votes today. As one strategist put it, \"every day is election day.\" There has been a lot of talk of the ground game in this election. In the past that meant sending buses for grannies on polling day - finding out who would like to vote for you and making sure they have transport for the big day. Finding out who is sympathetic, apathetic, reluctant or persuadable is still vital. But widespread early voting, as well as postal voting, changes the game. Once a person says in principle they would like to vote for your candidate, you can check that they have gone to vote at all. If they haven't, you can check the next day. And the next. Until they get so fed up they do vote. As an added bonus no last-minute blunder by your candidate allows them to change their mind. This is why it is so important. I've repeatedly said in the end this election will all come down to turnout. Think about what Mr Obama did in 2008: he persuaded a lot of people who didn't usually bother to vote, to vote for him. Without those extra votes he would have won, but not have won big. Some commentators say that it isn't really that tight a race - Mr Obama is still ahead in the swing states that matter. That's true. But only by a tiny margin, well within a margin of error. Mr Romney's team are trying to persuade disappointed Obama supporters that their man isn't worth giving another chance, and maybe theirs is. A Romney strategist told me they were hoping for \"molt\" - to me a new and novel term for switchers. So Mr Obama needs to get as many of those half-hearted 2008 voters in the bag as possible. If possible before polling day.",

        "Alesha O'Connor, Rhodri Miller, Corey Price, all 17 and from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, and Margaret Challis, 66, from Merthyr Tydfil, were killed near Storey Arms, Brecon, in March 2015. The Aberdare inquest heard Rhodri was driving the teenagers in one car. The coroner concluded all four died as a result of a road traffic accident. The inquest was told Rhodri's car was one of seven vehicles in a convoy going on a drive from Barry on the night of 6 March. Rhys Hunter, a passenger in the car, said Rhodri had passed his test a few days earlier. He said before the group set off someone warned him \"be careful, we're on a mountain\" and at one point during the journey the driver ran a red light. Minutes before the crash, Mr Hunter took a picture and the speedometer in the car he was in showed 75 mph (120kmh). But Mr Hunter said Rhodri was not trying to catch up with the vehicle in front of him and had not been trying to overtake another vehicle. \"Rhodri started to lose control and we collided with the other car,\" he said. \"I'm not sure why it happened or why the car was out of control. Probably because of the way it was driven.\" Joseph Fetter, who was driving behind Rhodri's car, said he was driving consistently around five car lengths behind and no racing had taken place, but he had seen Rhodri's brake lights come on several times. \"I think it was inexperience that made him lose control,\" he said. \"I wasn't pushing him on - I didn't know the road at all. It was dark.\" Passengers in some of the other vehicles said Rhodri was not overtaking but did lose control of his car on the bend, swerving from one side of the road to the other. But survivor Emlyn Williams, who was in the other car involved in the crash along with friend Mrs Challis, disputed some of the evidence. \"The car was coming down by a bend. I saw another car overtaking it. The car hit me, that was it,\" he said. \"The only thing I knew was a bang, the windscreen broke and the airbag came out. \"I tried to get out and see to Mrs Challis. I went to the other car. It was quiet, silent. There was no opportunity to steer out of the way.\" Drivers and passengers in vehicles travelling in the direction of Merthyr Tydfil described in police statements seeing the cars leave a lay-by at Storey Arms minutes before the collision. The inquest was told they pulled out too quickly and too close to each other. One witness said: \"Boy racers. It's obvious they were on a mission.\" Dyfed-Powys Police Insp Gary Jones told the inquest messages found on mobile phones showed those in the convoy had discussed speed. One read: \"It's madness. Everyone's racing there are 9 cars\" while another read \"why would I want to go along cars with turbos - I'll be the slowest there.\" PC David Stacey, who investigated what had happened, said it was \"like nothing I had seen in 20 years service. It was a distressing scene.\" He told the inquest he believed what Mr Williams had seen was Rhodri's car out of control, possibly caused by approaching the unmarked bend at too high a speed and braking in the turn, but not overtaking. Rhodri and Corey were pronounced dead at the scene while Alesha and Mrs Challis died at Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr. The inquest heard new road signs had since been put in place on that section of road but the coroner recommended that signage should warn about the upcoming bend. In a statement, Rhodri's family described their son as \"the child every parent would dream of,\" adding: \"Our hearts have been ripped out, and nothing is the same.\" The family said they would like to see lessons learned and for young drivers to be made to realise the implications of serious car accidents in the same way as those who are caught speeding do. The family also called for more rigorous conditions to be placed on new drivers.",
        "Leinster fly-half Sexton was injured in Saturday's Pro12 final defeat by Connacht and requires surgery. Full-back Rob Kearney has a hamstring injury with his brother Dave, a winger, ruled out by a torn calf muscle. Ian Madigan, Craig Gilroy and uncapped Connacht duo Tiernan O'Halloran and Matt Healy have all been called up. With Munster's Simon Zebo already missing the tour, Ulster's Jared Payne looks in line to be switched from his regular centre role to full-back. Payne has played at full-back for most of his career but was moved to centre by Ireland coach Joe Schmidt to help fill the midfield void left following Brian O'Driscoll's retirement. Connacht's O'Halloran will be the other full-back option in Schmidt's squad. Bordeaux-bound Madigan was a notable omission from Schmidt's initial squad but Sexton's absence means a reprieve for the former Leinster fly-half. \"We initially hoped it [Sexton's injury] could be managed but it will require surgery,\" said Schmidt, who added the fly-half will be ruled out for three months. While Sexton's injury has meant a call up for Madigan, Ulster's Paddy Jackson now looks in position to start in the First Test in Cape Town on Saturday week. Wing Luke Fitzgerald, Sexton's club-mate, was ruled out of the tour earlier this week after also being injured in the Pro12 decider. Schmidt already has a long list of absentees, which includes backs Zebo and Tommy Bowe, and forwards Cian Healy, Denis Buckley, Nathan White, Sean O'Brien, Peter O'Mahony and Josh van der Flier. Despite the injuries, Schmidt believes his side can still strongly challenge the Springboks. \"My expectation is that the players will work hard, they'll unite really effectively under [captain] Rory Best's leadership and that we will be competitive,\" said the Ireland coach. \"Whether that's enough, we'll find out on the 11th, 18th and 25th of June (the dates for the three Tests).\" Ireland, who have never won in South Africa, face the Springboks in the first Test in Cape Town on 11 June, with the sides meeting again over the following two weekends in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth. The three June Tests will influence rankings for the 2019 World Cup. Forwards: Finlay Bealham (Connacht), Rory Best (Ulster), Sean Cronin (Leinster), Ultan Dillane (Connacht), Tadgh Furlong (Leinster), Jamie Heaslip (Leinster), Iain Henderson (Ulster), David Kilcoyne (Munster), Jack McGrath (Leinster), Jordi Murphy (Leinster), Sean Reidy (Ulster), Mike Ross (Leinster), Quinn Roux (Connacht), Rhys Ruddock (Leinster), Donnacha Ryan (Munster), CJ Stander (Munster), Richardt Strauss (Leinster), Devin Toner (Leinster).

        "It was believed the Irish Army had removed all the wreckage at the time but a group of aviation historians and Queens University Belfast archaeologists thought otherwise. After ground surveys pointed to parts being present just four meters below the surface, a number of items were excavated on Saturday. These included the cockpit door. The pilot - Gordon Hayter Proctor - had safely bailed out of the plane on the northern side of the border after his instruments froze. It glided on before crashing in a field in Figullar, Emyvale, on 20 November 1942. The plane, which had seen action in the Battle of Britain, was considered \"war-weary\" and had been assigned to a weather-monitoring squadron operating out of RAF Aldergrove in Antrim in 1942. Project organiser Jonny McNee told the BBC the dig had \"exceeded expectations\" and they had recovered \"Monaghan's Battle of Britain forgotten heritage.\" The aviation historian said they had unearthed internal parts of the Rolls Royce engine and plates inscribed with information, such as manufacturing details. \"The cockpit door was a bit of a surprise,\" he said. \"The last person to use it was Flt Lt Gordon Hayter Proctor who was later declared missing while serving in Burma. \"He has no grave and now he will be remembered in a bit of Monaghan. The display will be homage to him.\" He added that the team would love to make contact with any of his family members. Mr McNee said they knew more than 90 of the plane had been taken away at the time and probably scrapped. \"We had done our research and by looking at the Irish Army military archives, we knew that a substantial amount of the plane was taken away,\" he said. \"Back in September we applied for and were granted a licence to use ground-penetrating radar which detected the impact crater and showed sizable metallic remains.\" Pupils from three schools - two in Monaghan and one in County Londonderry, had been invited to help out at the dig, which also attracted the attention of many locals. Josie McCusker, who remembers seeing the Spitfire fall from the sky all those years ago, stayed for the entire duration of the dig. \"It was the morning, a Sunday morning and I remember the loud noise of it,\" she told BBC Radio Ulster. \"My father was milking cows in the byre and he heard the noise and he ran into the house thinking it was on fire. \"We then discovered it was a plane - it took the tops off the trees and a piece of it fell down in a gooseberry bush behind the house. \"I remember much of the plane being removed by the Army, and remember seeing it on a lorry.\" The job now is to clean, sort, identify and catalogue the items before handing them to the County Monaghan Museum, which will then be able to claim it has artefacts from the only Battle of Britain Spitfire to be legally excavated in Ireland.",
        "But Mikel, 25, has been charged by the FA with misconduct following his involvement in the incident. The Blues had claimed Clattenburg directed racial language at Mikel in their home defeat by Manchester United. \"The FA's verdict of no case to answer against referee Mark Clattenburg was hardly a surprise. \"Ever since it emerged the alleged victim John Obi Mikel hadn't even heard the comment but was relying on second-hand evidence from Brazilian team-mate Ramires, Chelsea's case looked as wafer thin as their managerial contracts. \"Rightly, given how high the stakes were, the FA has taken its time to be sure. \"And while their reluctance to criticise Chelsea for bringing the case is designed to avoid other players from clamming up if they believe they have been racially abused, this is yet another damaging blow for a club which seems a magnet for trouble.\" Clattenburg said it was \"truly frightening\" to have faced the prospect that his career might be over. Following the match at Stamford Bridge on 28 October, the FA interviewed Clattenburg, Mikel and several other Blues players before reaching its decision to clear the official and charge the Nigerian. \"It is alleged that in or around the match officials' changing room at the end of the fixture, Mikel used threatening andor abusive andor insulting words andor behaviour,\" an FA statement read. Mikel has until Friday, 30 November to respond. Chelsea have indicated he will not deny the charge but will request a hearing to \"explain the mitigating circumstances.\" The evidence for Chelsea's allegation towards Clattenburg came from their midfielder Ramires who, when interviewed, explained that his instinctive reaction was to seek confirmation from Mikel as to what the referee said. Mikel, who was being spoken to by Clattenburg, was much closer than Ramires and did not hear what it is suggested was said to him. The two assistant referees and the fourth official revealed they did not hear any of the comments Clattenburg was accused of making, despite being linked up to the referee via microphones. An FA statement also said the complaint by Mikel's team-mate Ramires was \"made in good faith.\" Clattenburg, 37, has always maintained his innocence and the Metropolitan Police dropped its own inquiry earlier this month. He missed four weekends of Premier League matches while the FA investigated Chelsea's complaint. \"I am looking forward to putting this behind me and concentrating on refereeing in the Premier League and other competitions,\" said Clattenburg. \"The messages of encouragement from those inside and outside of the game have helped me through the most stressful time of my professional life. \"To know you were innocent but there was the opportunity for it to wreck your career was truly frightening. \"Racism has no place in football and this experience should not discourage those to speak out if they genuinely believe they are a victim of abuse. \"However, there are processes that should be adhered to in order that any investigation can be carried out in a manner that is fair for all parties involved. \"I know first hand the ramifications of allegations of this nature being placed into the public domain ahead of a formal process and investigation. I hope no referee has to go through this in the future.\" What has happened over the last few weeks should not overshadow the fact the on-pitch relationship between match officials, players and managers is the best we've ever known it Responding to the announcement, a Chelsea statement said: \"Chelsea Football Club accepts the Football Association's decision regarding Mark Clattenburg and welcomes the fact that the FA recognises the club and players were correct in reporting the matter. \"The club accepts the case is now concluded and notes the FA states the allegation was made in good faith. \"Chelsea FC has a duty of care, as do all employers, to act responsibly when such allegations are reported by employees. \"We did not take the decision to lodge a formal complaint with the FA lightly and followed the correct processes and protocols throughout.\" Referees' union Prospect, on behalf of Clattenburg, are asking Chelsea for a full apology and compensation. Police dropped an investigation into the alleged comments towards Chelsea's Mikel and Juan Mata in the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge last month. Chelsea initially suggested Spanish midfielder Mata had also been verbally abused by Clattenburg, before deciding there was insufficient evidence to support these claims.",
        "However the single point was still enough to send opponents Kinlochshiel top of the table. The four pointer in Drumnadrochit to escape the relegation play off place gave Glenurquhart their first Premiership victory for two months, 2-0 at home to Lochaber. Mid table, a late surge gave Lovat a 3-1 success at Kingussie but without a change in league placing for either side. And in the National Division, Kilmallie's 5-1 victory at Ballachulish means that they trail leaders Glasgow Mid Argyll only on goals scored. There had been much pre-match build up as Kinlochshiel prepared for their first trip across the Skye Bridge for a long time on serious shinty business and it was the visiting side who opened the scoring through Duncan DA MacRae after just 12 minutes. And there it looked as if it would stay until the penultimate minute when Murchison secured a share of the points. However Skye, with four draws in five games, still seek their first victory. Although Shiel are now a point clear of previous leaders Kyles, whose Celtic Society Cup tie in Oban was postponed, they have also played three more games. Glenurquhart, their defence of the MacTavish Cup already at an end and sitting second bottom in the league, were desperate to kick start their season on the visit of Lochaber. After a goalless first half, David Smart opened the scoring early in the second and Conor Golabek put the points in the bag late on. This leaves Lochaber in the play off place on goal difference and with two extra games played. At The Dell, Kevin Bartlett put Lovat ahead midway through the first half and Thomas Borthwick got Kingussie's equaliser shortly after half time. Greg Matheson gave Lovat the lead again but it was only after Euan Ferguson's third in the final minute that they could breathe easily. After Lorne Brown scored first for Ballachulish, Kilmallie bit back with a hat trick from Duncan Rodger, which included a last minute penalty, bracketing a Liam MacDonald double. They have scored just three goals fewer than Glasgow Mid Argyll who were the day's top scorers in senior shinty when they ousted hosts Taynuilt 8-0 in the Camanachd Cup. The other National Division game was in Inverness where Grant Griffin scored twice in the second half to help Inveraray to a 3-2 victory.",
        "The move reunites the 21-year-old with former boss David Moyes, as well as ex-team-mates Donald Love and Paddy McNair who joined for a PS5.5m fee this week. Belgium international Januzaj had asked to leave Old Trafford on a permanent transfer but United preferred a loan. He has scored five goals in 63 appearances for the club and is under contract until the summer of 2018. Januzaj spent four months on loan to Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund last season, but played only 12 games before returning to his parent club. United boss Jose Mourinho said of the switch: \"He fits in my plans. That is why he is on loan at a Premier League club \"If he doesn't fit in my plans, I don't care where he is going, I just send him to Borussia Dortmund where he didn't play one match. He is talented.\"",
        "Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has asked the interior minister to take steps \"immediately\" to dissolve the Revolutionary Nationalist Youth (JNR). Five people are under investigation over the death of Clement Meric, 18. He was badly beaten in a clash between far-right and anti-fascist activists in Paris on Wednesday, and later died. The Paris Prosecutor, Francois Molins said according to witnesses the two groups had run into each other by chance in a busy shopping district near St Lazare train station, where a fight broke out. He said the arrested suspects claimed to have responded to provocation by the left-wing group. All five suspects went before a judge on Saturday, two days after they were detained. According to the prosecutor, the main suspect named Esteban, 20, was being investigated on suspicion of murder. \"The [suspect] named Esteban acknowledged to police that he had struck Clement Meric twice - bare-fisted, he claimed - including the blow that caused him to fall to the ground,\" Mr Molins said. Other witnesses said \"Esteban\" had worn a knuckle-duster. \"A friend of Clement Meric said he saw him with a knuckle-duster, while another witness at the scene referred to a'shiny object' in his hands.\" Two sets of knuckle-dusters had been found at his home, the prosecutor added. The teenager was placed on life support but was declared brain dead and died on Thursday. French President Francois Hollande said he condemned the attack \"in the strongest terms.\" France has seen increasing tension between left and right, following a fierce debate over the introduction of same-sex marriage. The JNR is the militant wing of a far-right movement known as the Third Way. It has denied any link to the brawl. Its leader, Serge Ayoub, has been questioned by police following the killing but is not a suspect. But Mr Molins said on Saturday that all the suspects under investigation had ties to the Third Way. Only one, a young woman named Katia, was said to have admitted being a member, he added. Prime Minister Ayrault said in a statement: \"I have asked [Interior Minister Manuel Valls] immediately to begin the procedure.... to proclaim the dissolution of the Revolutionary Nationalist Youths.\" The government has vowed to crackdown on fascist groups. Mr Valls said: \"Sadly such movements are resurging.... racists, anti-Semites and homophobes.\" France's main far-right party, the National Front, described the killing of Mr Meric as \"appalling.\"",

She said she never suspected any wrongdoing during the time she knew the Fees. The couple were convicted of killing Liam at his Fife home in March 2014. They had blamed another boy for the murder. Ms McCusker said she would now change a \"friends forever\" tattoo, that she had done with the Fees, so she would not have a daily reminder of the women. She said: \"I was shocked, totally shocked when everything happened. \"I looked out of my window and I saw a load of ambulances and I saw them standing in the street shouting'help'. \"I didn't know what to do at the time as we weren't talking.\" Ms McCusker said she regretted that \"nothing\" could be done now that Liam was gone. Ms McCusker said that when she went into the Fee's house to feed their snakes when they were on holiday in St Andrews there was \"nothing out of place\" to make her suspect the pair were doing harm. She said: \"They are going to be in jail for sometime but they don't even deserve a place in prison because they are still going to get everything paid for them and they are still going to get every day of their lives. \"It's not fair because they are going to come out and they are still going to have their own lives to lead and little Liam, where is he?

        "Some 2,600 people attended the service in central Paris, including President Francois Hollande, survivors of the attacks and victims' families. A minute's silence was held and the names of all the victims read out. Attackers with assault rifles and suicide belts targeted a number of sites in the capital. Islamic State later said it was behind the assault. In pictures: Paris remembers with flags What happened on the night Who were the victims? Who were the attackers? Some of the survivors who attended were in wheelchairs, while members of the fire and ambulance services wore uniforms for the 45-minute ceremony in the courtyard of the historic Les Invalides complex. In his speech, President Hollande said France would \"do all it can to destroy this army of fanatics.\" \"It will operate relentlessly to protect its children.\" he said. He vowed that France would respond with more music, concerts and sporting events, after some of the attacks targeted a concert venue and a stadium. Among those attending the service were the parents of British victim Nick Alexander, who said that they were now \"intrinsically linked\" to those who had also lost loved ones. \"The outpouring of love from around the world has been a great comfort to us and makes us even more proud to have had Nick as our son,\" they added. It started with a song that said it all: \"When all we have is love.\" The lyrics of the iconic singer Jacques Brel echoed through the Court of Honour of the Invalides - a place where the French nation delivers its highest tributes to heroes and casualties of war. There was a silent pause and the names of those who lost their lives were read out. We heard their age too - most of them in their twenties or thirties. It was a long and painful listen as portraits were screened in the courtyard. Francois Hollande was the only speaker - he gave a brief and simple address, in which he paid tribute to the \"130 smiles and faces\" of the victims. Announcers read out the names and ages of all 130 victims, from 39-year-old Stephane Albertini to 37-year-old Stella Verry. However, not all the victims' families accepted the invitation to attend the service at the grand complex that houses a military museum and Napoleon's tomb. The family of one victim told French media they had refused, saying not enough had been done to protect the nation in the wake of other attacks earlier this year. President Hollande has this week embarked on a diplomatic push to increase support for the fight against IS militants. He flew to Washington to meet President Barack Obama, then met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian PM Matteo Renzi before travelling for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, where more coordination on air strikes and intelligence was agreed. Cooperation with the regime? Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Is France signalling an important shift in policy on Syria? That is the question after the French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius spoke on French radio this morning. Mr Fabius said France's aim was to destroy Raqqa, the self-declared capital of IS in Syria. For that, bombing was needed, he said, but also ground forces. France would not provide ground troops, he added, so the fighting would have to be done by the Syrian opposition, Sunni Arab armies, and, controversially, the regime forces of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. As international news wires hummed, Mr Fabius rowed back slightly. In a \"clarification,\" he said the participation of Syrian government forces would only be possible within the framework of a political transition. In other words, only once there was agreement on the eventual departure of Assad. But it remains a significant development for the French to say that government troops may form part of their plan for destroying IS. As for the practicality of Syrian troops cooperating with the Syrian opposition, that is another matter. On Friday, France said for the first time that Syrian government forces could contribute to a ground campaign against IS. Syria quickly welcomed the suggestion, although French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius later clarified the forces could only take part if a process was under way leading to the removal of President Bashar al-Assad. In a series of co-ordinated attacks on 13 November, gunmen opened fire on restaurants and bars in Paris and stormed a concert hall, where 89 people were shot dead. Three more attackers blew themselves up outside the Stade de France stadium in Saint-Denis, north of Paris, after staff denied them entry to a football match between France and Germany. More than 350 people were injured in the attacks - the worst in recent French history. The unanswered questions Is bashing Belgium justified? At least nine people are believed to have been directly involved in carrying out the latest attacks. They are all dead, but two more men, including suspect Salah Abdeslam, are still on the run as a huge manhunt continues in France and Belgium. Some of the attackers - including suspected ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who died in a police raid in Paris last week - had lived in Brussels. On Friday, a Belgian judge charged a sixth suspect there with offences in connection with the Paris attacks. He was charged with \"terrorist murders and participation in the activities of a terrorist organisation.\"",

        "Should Scotland be an independent country? And for some those six words printed on four million ballot papers did not allow for any kind of doubt. For the true believers it was simple, Scotland was a nation. Not for these purists the distraction of debate, obsessing over the price of oil and the return on government gilts. No. They took a long, if not particularly fashionable view which conjured up battles and spirits of old, ghosts of men who fought for Scotland's freedom in the 13th and 14th centuries: William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, Andrew de Moray. Some who thirsted for independence drew inspiration from the Jacobite risings which attempted to restore the House of Stuart to the British throne in the 18th century. Others remembered the short-lived 1820 insurrection by the Lanarkshire weaver James Wilson and his fellow radicals who were hanged for rising up to demand parliamentary reform. And yet such undiluted historical nationalism was a largely private affair. Wilson's slogan \"Scotland Free, or a Desert,\" which in the 1980s you would see daubed on Scottish motorway bridges in sloppy white paint, did not feature in 2014. Those days are past now. And in the past, it seems, they must remain. \"You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose,\" said the late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo. Not in Scotland. The independence campaign of 2014 was almost entirely prosaic, with advocates focusing on what the late Professor Sir Neil McCormick called a \"utilitarian nationalism\" which desired independence as \"the best means to the well-being of the Scottish people.\" This was a battle not in memory of Stirling Bridge or Bannockburn nor to avenge Flodden or Culloden but for Scotland's wallets. \"Yes\" lost, of course. Scotland awoke on a damp, drizzly autumn morning in 2014 to a decisive, if not overwhelming, endorsement of the Union: 44.7 had said yes to independence, 55.3 had said no. Why? A feeling has taken hold among some of \"the 45,\" as the losers quickly became styled, that Scotland was cheated; that a powerful cabal of business, media and even the security apparatus of the British state combined to bully and frighten folk into voting no. Scottish referendum results in detail And certainly the establishment message about independence, as promulgated by an almost entirely hostile press, was strikingly negative, despite many \"No\" voters holding a positive, even romantic view of the union. During the campaign, supporters of the UK often said they felt sadness and dismay at the prospect of a 300-year-old relationship ending in divorce. Many Scottish citizens were born south of the border - census data put the number eligible to vote in the referendum at 422,386 - and many more Scots had personal connections, or simply an affinity with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There were plenty of Scots for whom a commitment to the union was not a pragmatic calculation. It was simply about being British, feeling at home in London and Edinburgh, in Glasgow and Liverpool, in Aberdeen and Newcastle; about having close friends, family and colleagues north and south of the Cheviots. And yet with rare exceptions, such as a passionate speech by the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, \"Better Together\" campaigners for Britain were as prosaic as their opponents. Commonality of language; three centuries and more of shared history; the creation of the welfare state; the bond of standing together to defeat fascism: all were drowned out by a message of economic and even geopolitical doom. Scotland, it was suggested, would be impoverished by going it alone, interest rates would soar, businesses would flee. In short, Scots would suffer. The former secretary general of NATO, Lord George Robertson, who once predicted that the revival of the old Scots Parliament as a devolved legislature would \"kill nationalism stone dead,\" even warned that independence would be \"cataclysmic\" for the western world. It would be welcomed by the global \"forces of darkness,\" he intoned. Many supporters of independence were stunned by the range and ferocity of the attacks and were shocked at how robustly their proposition was scrutinised. If only every second news story ended with a line about how wonderful everything would be in an independent Scotland they suggested, absurdly, then the people would see the light. At least one prominent critic of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign has a rather different take. \"In the September 2014 referendum, Yes failed to win the economic arguments,\" he wrote in a critique six months after the vote, because it \"failed to present a case on the currency, a central bank and fiscal policy that was credible.\" The critic is no cheerleader for the union. He is Gordon Wilson, leader of the Scottish National Party from 1979 to 1990. Jim Sillars, a former deputy leader of the party, has also criticised its strategy, writing that the campaign was \"handicapped by an SNP White Paper that, on at least two counts (a currency union and 10 per cent cut in corporation tax), was a gift to the No side.\" Since Mr Wilson's review of the referendum six months ago, the economic argument has not become any easier for those who say Scotland would be better off by seceding from the UK. The figures and the arguments are, by now, wearily familiar to Scots: in 201314, Scotland paid PS400 more per head in tax than the UK as a whole. This includes revenue from oil and gas in Scottish waters, in other words the lion's share of tax from Britain's North Sea operations. So far so good for a nationalist. But with PS400 more per head in contributions, Scots received PS1,200 more per head than the UK average in spending. PS400 Scots pay more per head in tax than the UK average PS1,200 Scots receive more per head than UK average Campaigners against independence call this hefty PS800 per head a \"union dividend,\" warning that if Scotland had control of all taxation and domestic spending, even in an arrangement that stopped short of full independence, it would face deep cuts to public services or big tax rises. Nationalists retort that Scotland, like practically all nations including the UK, could borrow money and run a deficit while it designed policies better suited to improving growth and productivity. But right now the starting point for such an ambitious project looks tough. The latest official figures for borrowing as a share of economic output - a sensible measure of how much debt a country can sustain - show that Scotland was performing considerably worse than the UK average in 201314, with a deficit of 8.1 of GDP compared to the UK's 5.6. Not only that but assuming a future independent Scotland wanted to use sterling, a currency union would be likely to face the same objections raised during the referendum campaign. And, for all the recent insistence of nationalists that oil is nothing more than a bonus for Scotland, the slump in price to a value way below even the Scottish government's most pessimistic forecast, along with thousands of job losses in and around Aberdeen, can hardly be regarded as inconsequential. And so nationalism remains in danger of being ensnared by Catch-22. If Scotland is struggling so badly in the union, how can it afford to go it alone? If it is thriving, why bother? Either way, having chosen to campaign on utilitarian ground, and having trumpeted the very same official figures on previous occasions when they were more favourable to independence, the SNP can hardly complain that a majority of voters weighed up the risks and decided not to take them. Nonetheless the very fact that many who voted \"No\" said they might have voted \"Yes\" had the economic outlook been more favourable suggests that something was afoot, a feeling that has only increased in the year following the poll. Not so long ago Scottish nationalism felt like a fringe activity, pursued by the kind of man who wore a kilt on a Tuesday afternoon. Then, with the opening of the devolved parliament in 1999, the centre of Scotland's political life shifted to Edinburgh and within a decade everything had changed. In 2007 the SNP won control of the devolved government and this May, just seven months after its raison d'etre was rejected in a supposed \"once-in-a-generation\" vote, it swept the board at the general election, taking 56 of Scotland's 59 seats in the House of Commons. Nationalism was not \"stone dead\" but alive and thriving. The country, it seemed, had heard something that it liked after all, a positive message about a brighter future. This thirst for change was in tune with other European countries where anger about out-of-touch politicians and arrogant bankers following the financial crisis of 20078 was transformed, for a time at least, into a rebellion against The System. Like voters in Greece, Spain, Italy and elsewhere, Scottish citizens have found somewhere to channel a previously inchoate feeling that 21st century capitalist democracies are \"gamed\" in favour of a wealthy elite. Whether or not this feeling is accurate - and whether or not nationalism is the answer - are of course questions open to debate. But whether or not the feeling is real is surely not in doubt; indeed the same forces are now having an extraordinary effect on the Labour Party. You might call it a \"Paisley Pattern\" after the rejection by that town of the polished and precise Douglas Alexander, who ran Labour's general election campaign and was preparing to take up the post of foreign secretary, in favour of the passionate 20-year-old Mhairi Black of the SNP, now the youngest MP of the democratic era. Bright, optimistic and raw, with her insistence that the Labour party left her, rather than the other way around, Ms Black personifies the shift to the SNP. On a bright spring day a fortnight before the general election, we watched her bounce up the street, blonde hair pulled tight in a ponytail, a messenger's bag slung over her shoulder, charming voters with a sympathetic ear and a smile. She looked like the anti-politician's politician. \"We triumphed on a wave of hope\" she said later in a powerful maiden speech which became an internet sensation, \"something different, something better.\" We triumphed on a wave of hope - something different, something better.\" It is this kind of vague optimism which is proving hard for the SNP's challengers to oppose and which now makes the strategy of economic doom from supporters of the union look short-sighted. After all, when Glasgow has voted to leave the UK, something is up. Glasgow! The second city of the British Empire; bombed in the Blitz when Britain stood together against the Nazis; cradle of the pan-British Labour movement - a majority in Glasgow said they wanted independence for Scotland. And while only Dundee, West Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire followed suit last September, there was evidence even in the \"No\" vote of a loosening of ties. Research carried out immediately after the referendum suggested that far more \"No\" voters across Scotland rejected independence primarily because the economic risks were too great than did so because of a strong attachment to the UK and its shared history, culture and traditions. Since then every plan to devolve further power from Westminster to Holyrood seems only to encourage greater support for the SNP and its calls for even more devolution, while attempts to design a stable federal solution for the UK have stalled not least because the Liberal Democrats, who should by rights be inking the blueprints, are in disarray. And so the question for supporters of the United Kingdom is this: if the message that money is all that matters continues to be the dominant one in the minds of voters, then what actually binds the country together? If it is nothing more than coins, notes and loans then perhaps the UK is fraying at the edges after all. A perception, encouraged by all three major UK parties before the referendum, that the union relies on relatively poor Scotland being dependent in perpetuity on English subsidy might have looked like the best way to win last September's referendum but even if it was accurate, how durable, popular and attractive is such a downbeat, even cynical, message in the longer run? The SNP's stunning general election landslide hints at one answer - and these days the question is being asked south as well as north of the border with a rise in English nationalism and proposals to reduce the influence of Scottish MPs at Westminster prompting Gordon Brown to warn that \"the union is in mortal danger.\" There may yet come a day when England wants Scotland to leave the UK. Meanwhile the SNP leader, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon continues to walk on water and the party's electoral lustre remains apparently undimmed as it skilfully keeps the focus on \"Westminster austerity\" and the Conservative Party's mission to slim the state by slashing public spending, a political philosophy which happens to be rather unpopular in Scotland. The devolved SNP government's popularity by contrast is all the more remarkable when you consider the serious difficulties it faces after eight years in power in the areas it does control, including; Perhaps the party has become a victim of its own success as well as its opponents' weaknesses. Perhaps slick professionalism, clever marketing and unflinching loyalty from supporters and parliamentarians do not make for effective scrutiny of government policies. And there are big problems ahead for the SNP as it poses as a radical socialist party while embracing the neo-liberal economic consensus which has prevailed since Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, problems that will only become thornier with Jeremy Corbyn leading the Labour Party on to genuinely Left-wing ground. How many of the SNP's policies, apart from unilateral nuclear disarmament and arguably land reform could be regarded as genuinely radical? The conundrum for the nationalists has not changed, how can they convince Middle Scotland that independence is a benign project while at the same time presenting it to those who rarely or never vote as something close to a revolution? Well, not by insulting people for a start. While the \"Better Together\" campaign preferred to do its hectoring in private last year - with one senior figure from the Labour Party literally slamming the door as he stormed out of a meeting with the BBC for example - the SNP leader Alex Salmond appeared content to allow certain online supporters, dubbed \"cybernats,\" to take a far more public approach to rubbishing anyone who dared question them. Thus Scotland's most successful modern author JK Rowling and its greatest Olympian Sir Chris Hoy were both abused online, as were thoughtful pro-Union commentators such as David Torrance, Chris Deerin and Alex Massie, painted not just as political opponents or sceptical journalists but as enemies of Scotland, traitors, Quislings and so on. Such language appeared designed to delegitimise anyone who asked difficult questions rather than to engage them in meaningful debate. Whereas Mr Salmond was fond of dealing with such criticism by pointing out instances of unionists abusing nationalists online, Ms Sturgeon has taken a more robust approach, slapping down social media users who make offensive remarks in the name of the nationalist movement. This First Minister appears to understand that hectoring and harassing voters does not tend to win them over. Still, there are many people in Scotland for whom 2014 remains a year to forget, a divisive, unnecessary distraction from the challenges of the 21st century. Some felt uncomfortable in their own country and keep quiet still about their \"Britishness\" and support for the United Kingdom. But there are many others who regard last year as a turning of the tide, a beginning rather than an end, an opportunity for change. And with a utilitarian narrative firmly embedded in the minds of Scottish voters it is not too difficult to imagine a shift that puts the union under pressure again. Consider these questions; Perhaps these particular scenarios are unrealistic but the point is that with the SNP so strong, discontent with the status quo bubbling over, and most of the debate reduced to practicalities alone, it is not difficult to conjure up situations where Scottish independence is suddenly thrust back to the top of the agenda. It is as clear as the water in that Angus burn that the debate about Scotland's future is far from over.",
        "He vowed to recover billions of dollars \"stolen\" under previous administrations. Mr Buhari held talks with state governors over the lack of money to pay government workers their salaries. He and his All Progressives Congress won elections in March, ending some 16 years of rule by the Peoples Democratic Party. He was sworn in less than four weeks ago, taking over from Goodluck Jonathan, who had been in office since 2010. \"The days of impunity and lack of accountability are over,\" he told state governors. \"The next three months may be hard, but billions of dollars can be recovered, and we will do our best,\" he added. In an earlier briefing with journalists, he said it was a \"disgrace\" that government workers had not been paid for months.

        "Such values are ill-defined and vulnerable to misinterpretation, argued Southend head teacher, Robin Bevan. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) voted to monitor the policing of the requirement, introduced in England by the government last year. Mr Bevan said he had concerns about how the values \"might be interpreted by a future right-wing government.\" \"When it comes to the new requirement of promoting fundamental British values, including the role of law, here is one law that I would actively encourage you to disengage from,\" Mr Bevan, head of Southend High School for Boys, urged the union's annual conference in Liverpool. The government brought in the requirement in the wake of the Trojan Horse allegations, which suggested there had been attempts by groups of hardline Muslims to take over schools in Birmingham. Earlier this month a committee of MPs said that apart from one incident in one school \"no evidence of extremism or radicalisation was found by any of the inquiries in any of the schools involved.\" Requiring schools to promote \"fundamental British values\" could have \"unintended consequences,\" according to the text of the motion debated by the conference in Liverpool. \"There is no one in this hall who would argue against the important role that schools and colleges play in promoting personal morality, in developing a sense of civic duty, in fostering engagement with our democratic structures or in embracing a wider global understanding,\" said Mr Bevan. He said schools and colleges had, for a long time, been required to deliver a broad and balanced curriculum addressing issues of behaviour and conduct and placing this within a developmental framework of spiritual, moral and cultural understanding. \"These provisions have existed without controversy for many years and are ample and effective.\" He accused the rules on British values as \"deeply ill-considered\" and \"political posturing.\" \"In what way do fundamental British values differ, for example, from French or Swedish ones?\" They change over time, with women now \"allowed\" the vote, said Mr Bevan. \"If these fundamental British values change over time, we can hardly describe them as fundamental.\" But, he argued, the problem was not just one of definition. \"Just take one moment to imagine how fundamental British values might be interpreted by a future right-wing government, or a partner in that government.\" He said he was particularly concerned that Ofsted was being asked to gauge the views of students in order to assess how how well schools actively promote these values. There had already been cases of \"less-skilled inspectors\" doing this in a \"wholly-inappropriate way,\" he told journalists later. In particular he was concerned about the difference between \"what is taught and what is learned,\" with a proportion of every class apt to misunderstand or ignore lessons, be they about trigonometry or British values. \"I am not sure the government should ever be in the business of dictating values that should be taught in schools - but students should engage in those debates.... plurality, that's the way it should be,\" said Mr Bevan.",

        "Former England skipper Terry, 36, will leave the Premier League champions at the end of the season. He captained Chelsea to an FA Cup and Premier League Double in Clement's first season as assistant to then manager Carlo Ancelotti in 2008-09. \"I don't know his thinking, whether he is going to carry on,\" Clement said. \"I will have a conversation with him. I've known him a long time.\" Terry made his senior debut for Chelsea in 1998, and Sunday's home Premier League game against Sunderland could be his final appearance for the club. \"There's been talk in the media it could be his last game or that he will go on,\" Clement said. \"Whether that is here in the Premier League, or whether that is abroad, that is all unsure at the moment.\" Swansea's Premier League rivals Bournemouth are also reported to be interested in signing Terry, should he carry on playing. Meanwhile, former France and Chelsea midfielder Claude Makelele is to become a permanent part of Swansea's coaching staff.

        "It investigated online agents Booking.com, Expedia and hotel group InterContinental Hotels (IHG). The probe initially suspected the deals infringed competition law as they limited price competition. But it has now allowed such deals subject to certain conditions. The OFT has enabled online agents to discount the hotel's room price, to promote more competitive pricing. Previously, the websites were unable to offer discounts. Under the conditions, the OFT said consumers must first sign up to a membership scheme with a hotel, either of the agents, or another online agent. Customers must have also previously booked one room at the full rate with the online agent or hotel, to be eligible for future discounts, said the OFT. Booking.com and Expedia are two of the UK's largest online travel agents. The OFT launched its investigation in 2010 to look at allegations that there could be agreements and concerted practices resulting in fixed or minimum resale prices. Whether or not the move will open up competition and drive down prices is subject to some debate. Gaucho Rasmussen, enforcement director at the OFT, said he had looked at the conditions \"very, very carefully.\" He said: \"We did some consumer research and a significant amount of people would shop around and use smaller websites and new starters.\" Mr Rasmussen said the OFT had carried out two consultations and the decision was the best outcome. He said as the market kept changing, smaller websites could innovate and find a way to keep ahead. Dorian Harris, founder of discount booking website Skoosh, said he did not think the move would open up the market and push prices down. He said: \"I am baffled by the outcome.\" Smaller companies, such as Skoosh, could not afford to change their marketing strategy and hotel contracts to accommodate the OFT's conditions, so would struggle to offer the discounts, he said. Mr Harris says the conditions would discourage new consumers from using smaller, unknown websites rather than Booking.com or Expedia: \"The OFT have not understood the market. It is a huge failure in assessment.\" He said consumers would not want to pay for a full-rate room, to qualify for the discount rooms, from a new website such as Skoosh. They would instead prefer to get the discount straight away from larger websites, such as Expedia, where customers would most probably have already bought a premium-rate hotel room from, to qualify. He said the conditions would reinforce Booking.com or Expedia's dominance, adding the OFT had \"pandered to the interests\" of the two big companies. The OFT's Mr Rasmussen acknowledged there was a chance the set-up could lead to further monopoly, but he said the OFT would be monitoring movements in the market.",
        "This is not because of panic, but possibly as a way of suppressing it. As one MP put it: \"The wise heads will need to tell any hotheads to calm down.\" The prime minister will meet her internal critics head on. Having phoned over the weekend candidates who were defeated in an election she didn't need to call, she will find that many of those who escaped that fate are cross. But widespread demands for her to go are not expected. Instead, there will be demands for her to consult more, including meeting regularly with the 1922 executive, and to turn Downing Street from a bunker into an open house by broadening her range of staff. However, few MPs expect her position to be strong and stable for the next five years. One senior backbencher told me: \"It is inconceivable she will lead the party into the next election. Her authority has been diminished unquestionably.\" Another said: \"Party members have been too bruised by her.\" \"She has bought herself some time,\" said a senior backbencher, but added: \"How she behaves will determine how long she's there.\" There is a feeling that the party is holding on to nurse for fear of something worse. \"There is zero appetite for another election,\" as one MP put it, and a feeling that, in an early poll, victory wouldn't be guaranteed. Some say Labour's digital campaign and mobilisation of young people was particularly impressive, and another election would give Jeremy Corbyn the opportunity to do what he does best - campaign. Equally, a leadership election could be destabilising ahead of Brexit talks - though it's widely expected one will take place well before 2022. Some kind of arrangement with the DUP is seen as inevitable, but one MP cautioned \"the devil is in the detail.\" One of the reasons the 1922 meeting has been moved forward is so any deal can be discussed before it is sealed. Nonetheless, it is anticipated that the most flexible of arrangements is likely to be put in place; one that would mean there would have to be negotiations with the DUP on an issue-by-issue basis. Theresa May is expected to hear strong criticisms of what one backbencher dubbed \"her miserable manifesto.\" Of course, some individual policies, such as social care - \"It went down like a lead balloon\" - will be singled out, but the presentation of policy will also be attacked. MPs will say that an effective fourfold lifting of the floor on residential care costs wasn't widely understood. And a campaign which barely mentioned the economy will come under fire. \"We didn't dodge a bullet but were winged,\" said one. \"If Labour had a more credible leader we could have been in even bigger difficulties.\" There has been speculation that there may now be a \"softer Brexit,\" partly because of an influx of Scottish MPs who favour close trading relationships with the EU, but also because of the elevation of Damian Green to First Secretary of State. He is a friend of Mrs May's, a Remainer in the referendum campaign, and he has warned that concessions may have to be made in negotiations. But some senior Tories have told me that they will urge her to stick to her manifesto commitments on Brexit and, for them, controls on immigration and coming out of the single market are \"bottom lines.\" Others will want to insist on the freedom to strike trade deals, so coming out of the customs union is seen as essential. \"We must hold our nerve on Brexit,\" said one. However, another senior backbencher recognised that it would now be inevitable that Parliament would have greater influence over the process. \"She will be walking a tightrope,\" and, while MPs seem to see the necessity, in the words of one former minister, to \"shore her up in the short term,\" if she stumbles, she can fall at any time.",
        "Thousands of children have been examined every 10 years since 1973. A third of children in Wales were said to have good oral health overall, which compares to 39 in England. Decay was found in 52 of 12 year olds and 63 of 15 year olds, a slight improvement on the 2003 survey. But around 70 of them reported problems with their teeth. Decay was found in 41 of five-year-old children in their primary teeth and in 55 of eight-year-old pupils, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre report. Severe dental problems were worse among children from poorer backgrounds. Around a half (47) of five year olds could be said to have good oral health. But that declined with age, to around a quarter of 15 year old children. Other findings: The last results in 2003 showed that oral health had improved greatly since the 1970s and 1980s. This time, 12 and 15-year-olds were also asked to fill in a questionnaire on how they looked after their teeth. In 2009 the Welsh government launched a national scheme to encourage better dental health amongst young children. Since then it has invested over PS12m in the programme. It also suggested the programme had led to a recent 6 drop in the proportion of five-year-olds experiencing dental decay. Experts point out there could be several reason the health of children's teeth in Wales was still lagging behind those from other UK nations including socio-economic conditions. That survey 10 years ago also showed a big drop in 15-year-olds with obvious decay from 94 in 1983 to 58. Scottish children are not included in the 2013 survey but Wales has better results than Northern Ireland, where 31 were judged to be in good oral health. The Welsh Government said its own most recent monitoring survey showed a 6 drop in the proportion of five-year-olds with dental decay. \"However, there is more to do to improve the dental health of children in Wales especially since the vast majority of tooth decay is avoidable,\" said a spokesperson. \"Parents can help their children by reducing sugar intake and encouraging them to brush their teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste. \" It has also published its own survey of dental health to identify how much decay among five-years-olds is already present at the age of three.",
        "It needs to raise PS100,000 to save the 1733 portrait of Gambian Ayuba Suleiman Diallo, by artist William Hoare. The Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the NPG will all contribute to the total cost, which is PS555,000. The portrait, which has never been seen in public, has temporarily gone on show at the London gallery. Diallo, who was from a prosperous family of religious clerics, was captured as a slave in Africa at the age of 29 and was transported to work on a plantation in America. Read Will's blog After he was imprisoned for trying to escape, he met lawyer Thomas Bluett who, impressed by Diallo's intellect and education, took him to England. Diallo was received with great enthusiasm by aristocrats and scholars. The National Portrait Gallery said Hoare's painting was the first British portrait that honoured a named African subject as an individual and an equal. A spokesman for the gallery told the BBC News website that the work - which had been in a private collection - had sold at auction in Christie's in London in December for PS554,937.50. Following the sale, then Culture Minister Margaret Hodge put a temporary export bar on the painting and gave British museums and galleries the opportunity to buy it if they could match the price. The Heritage Lottery Fund and The Art Fund have already given grants of PS333,000 and PS100,000, while the NPG has also contributed. The Lottery Fund's grant will go towards the acquisition, as well as the costs of conserving, displaying and touring the painting around other galleries and museums in the UK. Broadcaster and National Portrait Gallery trustee, Zeinab Badawi, said: \"This portrait is a rare example of a painting of an 18th Century African in Britain. \"This portrait would be a vital and powerful addition to the collection at the National Portrait Gallery for its representation of Britain's diverse cultural heritage.\"",
        "For decades, large numbers of Haitians have migrated - many of them without papers - to the Dominican Republic, to escape the poverty and lack of employment in their homeland. In 2013, the Dominican Republic's highest court ruled that children born there to undocumented migrants were not automatically eligible for Dominican nationality. An 18-month period followed in which undocumented migrants were asked to \"regulate their status.\" Thousands who did not meet the deadline left the Dominican Republic, with many saying they were forced out by the authorities. As the BBC's Will Grant found, the Catholic Church has played a key role in the migration crisis with some priests defending the rights of the returnees while others have been criticised for promoting what activists describe as a policy of division. Weekly Mass at Parc Cadeau is a simple affair. The church is a small hut made of wicker and palm, the congregation spread out over a few wooden benches. Looking around the camp, one of several along Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic, you might think that the parishioners have little to be thankful for. It is surely one of the poorest places in Latin America. A year ago thousands of returning Haitians arrived at Parc Cadeau. Some had been forcibly deported from the Dominican Republic, others left voluntarily to avoid confrontation with the authorities. Today hundreds of families remain on the dusty ranch, living in hastily erected shacks of plastic sheeting, cardboard and rope, trapped in near stateless limbo. Soinicier Giles is typical of many in the camp. He spent 22 years living as a farmer in the Dominican Republic, before being deported last year. He takes me to a ramshackle hut to meet his wife Eleny and six of their eight children. The other two were left behind when he was deported. The conditions are extremely harsh, especially for the youngest. \"We sleep directly on the floor and it gets wet inside when it rains,\" Eleny explains. The children were all born in the Dominican Republic itself. They are showing signs of malnutrition and have developed a skin condition since arriving at the camp. \"They're very hungry, we all are, because we can only afford one meal a day,\" she says in Creole-accented Spanish. One of the few local figures helping the returnees is the parish priest, Father Luc Leandre. With funds from the International Organisation for Migration, he has helped relocate some of the most desperate families to nearby communities in Haiti. \"It's a grave crisis, very, very bad,\" Father Leandre tells me. \"The Church is like a mother for everyone and I have a duty to help. Not only that, the Pope told everyone they have to help the refugees wherever they are.\" But Father Leandre says the attitude of some conservative priests on the other side of the border, particularly in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, has complicated his work. \"The cardinal in Santo Domingo is personally very vocal in his support for the deportations. He supported sending all the Haitians back to their country.\" \"It's racism,\" he laments, saying the law specifically targeted black Haitians, a charge denied by lawmakers in the Dominican Republic. The priest Father Leandre was referring to has been the most influential voice in the Catholic Church in the Dominican Republic for almost 40 years: the controversial and outspoken Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus Lopez. Earlier this month, Pope Francis accepted the cardinal's resignation, which all archbishops are obliged to offer once they reach the age of 75. But he will remain an important figure in the Church and in Dominican public life. The BBC repeatedly requested an interview with Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus so he could respond to the criticisms against him but both he and his press secretary declined. In many ways, the Haitian migrant crisis has exposed greater divisions within the Catholic Church in Hispaniola over where it should position itself in the 21st Century. Pope Francis - both the first Jesuit pope and the first from Latin America - designated 2016 as the \"Year of Mercy\" and certainly Jesuits have been instrumental in supporting the Haitian returnees. In a video that went viral, the cardinal was filmed in a furious diatribe about a Jesuit priest called Mario Serrano calling him \"shameless\" and a \"leftist.\" \"He's not very accustomed to being publically confronted,\" Mario Serrano tells me from the northern border region of Dajabon, where he works with undocumented Haitians. \"I just said that (his) kind of speech was not according to the Catholic teaching and was not for a priest or a Christian. \"I think that really made him mad.\" Supporters of the new regularisation law, such as the former Dominican ambassador to the US, Flavio Espinal, deny that the legislation was either cruel or motivated by racism. \"Nothing's perfect and the process here has not been perfect. Yet this has been an extraordinary step forward in the direction of regularising close to 300,000 people who were undocumented in this country. \"That's not an easy decision to make nowadays.\" At night, to avoid detection, the farmer Soinicier Giles leaves Parc Cadeau and slips back into the Dominican Republic, the border marked by the Pedernales River. There he strips the trees for firewood to make charcoal, to sell to Dominican traders for a few dollars. He knows the practice damages the fertility of the soil, but it's the only available source of income. \"This is the only way we can survive,\" he says, motioning at his family, stuck inside the world's forgotten migrant crisis.

A crowd funding appeal began on Sunday and more than PS5,000 has been raised. Manager David Booker said building work was put off in favour of restocking during the shop's 41 years. The shop, which has four floors and a vegetarian cafe, was dubbed one of the best in the world by The Guardian, in 2008. It was also used as a set for the film When Did You Last See Your Father, in 2007. However, a number of cracks have appeared on the walls and the staircases between floors are bowing.

        "The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, attacked Gwen Louden in the court's foyer in January. The girl had been told to leave the court by PC Louden but returned and assaulted her. The court was told that the police officer was still off work. Depute fiscal Stewart Duncan previously told Dundee Sheriff Court: \"The accused was informed she was under arrest for another matter no longer before the court. \"PC Louden took the girl's hand and she pulled away, before PC Louden took her by the wrist. \"A struggle ensued and she then punched PC Louden in the face with her right fist then headbutted the officer to the left side of her face and repeatedly punched her on the head several more times.\" PC Louden and a colleague struggled with the girl and pulled her into the main reception area. Mr Duncan said: \"She continued to repeatedly punch and headbutt the officer to the head and face. \"The accused was eventually forced face down on the ground and handcuffed to the rear.\" The court was told PC Louden attended Ninewells Hospital with swelling and pain to her forehead and severe swelling to her left cheekbone. The 16-year-old, of Dundee, admitted a charge of assault to injury on 28 January. She also admitted breaching a community payback order previously imposed for another offence. Sheriff Tom Hughes sentenced the girl to eight months detention for the assault and a further four months, to be served consecutively, for the breach of the community payback order. He said: \"This is an appalling offence to a police officer while she was on duty. \"Police officers have a very difficult job and are on the front line of protecting us. \"They should be able to go to work and carry out their duty without injury. \"Both officers are to be commended for how they dealt with this. A custodial sentence is inevitable.\"",

At Nottingham Crown Court, Staley, 32, admitted causing Ms Shalloe's death by dangerous driving. Staley, of Arnold, Nottingham, is due to be sentenced on 13 May. Ms Shalloe worked as a research fellow at the University of Nottingham, and husband Jim Hill said his wife previously produced studies on road safety. \"She was cycling to work that morning,\" said Mr Hill, who had been married to Ms Shalloe for 16 years. \"I had a policewoman walk into my work office and tell me she'd been killed. It was like being split in two with an axe. \"It's turned my life upside down completely.

        "The premiere was held in New York on Sunday evening ahead of its opening this weekend. Ben Affleck stars in the film as Batman, with Henry Cavill taking the role of Superman. Affleck was described by some fans as their \"favourite Batman\" and \"the definite Batman. The film is directed by Zack Snyder and written by David S Goyer and Chris Terrio. It was conceived after Warner Brothers announced in 2013 their intention to produce a sequel to the Superman movie Man of Steel. The company later decided the character would instead meet Batman in a new feature film - the first time the superheroes will ever have met in a cinematic setting. Tom Nolan tweeted from the world premiere in New York, saying: \"So lucky to have been at the BVSPremiere last night and I still can't believe how amazing it was. Not good. Not great. Amazing.\" Mariam Chubinidzhe added: \"Still not over the BVSPremiere. Still so giddy. I'm totally going to be seeing this again.\" Rodrigo Mariano, who attended Sunday night's screening, said: \"I haven't felt this giddy after watching a movie since The Avengers. Goosebumps. Everywhere. Need to talk about it ASAP.\" \"Lots to process and think about, but overall BvS is an excellent movie,\" added Ben Kahn. Others fans were quick to praise the appearance of Wonder Woman in the film, played by Gal Gadot. \"The loudest applause of the night at BVSPremiere was Wonder Woman's entrance,\" said Ashley Warren. Her appearance had been teased in the film's trailers and marks the first time the character has ever been seen in a live-action theatrical film. \"I was pretty impressed by Batman v Superman. Everyone went crazy for Wonder Woman, she was amazing,\" tweeted Swati Teerdhala. But some critics noted the long duration and complex plot points. Writing in The Sun, Emma Gritt described it as an \"insanely long film.\" \"While die-hard DC Comic devotees might be punching the air as the Justice League are teasingly introduced, the average film fan may be left scratching their head,\" she wrote.",
        "Both led in the first half, but Gloucester went in up at the break with Marshall and Richard Hibbard scores. Sam James and Mike Phillips crossed in the first half for Sharks, who went 24-15 ahead with Byron McGuigan's try. But tries from Henry Trinder, Marshall and Billy Twelvetrees gave the hosts a bonus-point win. The result left the Cherry and Whites, in eighth, one point off sixth-placed Harlequins. However, their other top-six rivals Northampton Saints play Saracens on Sunday. Gloucester had made the early breakthrough at Kingsholm after a neat interchange between England international Jonny May and Marshall but the hosts allowed their opponents two quick tries, James and the soon-to-retire former Wales international Phillips capitalising on lax defence. Hibbard, though, put the hosts back in front after scoring off a line-out, before the scoreline turned in Sale's favour once more when AJ MacGinty set up Kieran Longbottom for a try and good play from number eight Josh Beaumont out on the wing sent in McGuigan. But Gloucester pulled clear after Trinder was left with an easy finish, and Marshall touched down his second before Twelvetrees rounded off a superb flowing move. Gloucester interim head coach Jonny Bell: \"I'm delighted with the five points but we always make life difficult by hurting ourselves. \"We scored five excellent tries but we gift-wrapped them three or four easy tries and there were too many fundamental mistakes. \"We've probably played better this season and lost.

        "The company has been negotiating with the pension regulator and the PPF in a bid to offload its pension liabilities and a decision is expected soon. Most, if not all, members of the scheme would see a reduction in benefits. Those under retirement age would receive an immediate 10 cut in their pension pot. In addition, annual payments to most members, including those already retired, would be less in the PPF than if the Hoover scheme continued. At about PS500m, the pension scheme is roughly the same size as BHS. BHS pensions is already receiving compensation from PPF which acts as a lifeboat for pensions so people are paid even when a company goes bust or is about to and if there are insufficient assets in the scheme. BHS is being assessed for take-over by the organisation. The Hoover scheme has a deficit of about PS250m. Parent company Hoover Candy stopped producing washing machines in Merthyr Tydfil in 2009, blaming competition in the marketplace. More than 300 workers lost their jobs although there is still a head office and a distribution warehouse in the town. It is believed about half of the Hoover pension scheme's 7,800 members live in Wales.

        "The regime had said the 22-year-old Otto Warmbier's coma was caused last year by botulism and a sleeping pill he took after his trial. He has not spoken since his return to his family hometown in Ohio. \"His neurological condition can be best described as a state of unresponsive wakefulness,\" said Dr Daniel Kanter. Mr Warmbier \"shows no understanding of language\" and has \"extensive loss of brain tissue\" which was likely caused by cardiopulmonary arrest, he said. According to scans taken after he arrived at the Cincinnati Medical Center earlier this week, there is no sign that he was physically abused during his detention, his doctors say. Mr Warmbier's condition is \"not what we normally see with traumatic brain injury. It's the type we see with cardiopulmonary arrest,\" Dr Kanter told reporters. They believe respiratory arrest led to his condition, which is caused by a lack of oxygen and blood in the brain. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Warmbier's father expressed doubts about the North Korean account of what caused the University of Virginia student's coma. \"Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care.\" Otto Warmbier, an economics student from the University of Virginia, was arrested in January 2016 while visiting North Korea as a tourist. He was given a 15-year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. Botulism is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis, difficulty in breathing and death in some cases. It's caused by the Clostridium botulinum bacteria, but the symptoms of botulism are not from the bacteria themselves. Instead, the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis. That poison is called botulinum - which you may know for its commercial use in Botox, which removes wrinkles by paralysing facial muscles. Botulism is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin, or through wounds. The foodborne method happens when the bacteria are tinned or stored in food in another way that deprives them from air (which is when they produce the poison). This rarely happens in modern Western food production, but is what North Korea claims happened to Mr Warmbier.",

On the right of the party, he entered Parliament in a by-election in the 1960s and served as chief whip and other roles under Margaret Thatcher. After leaving the House of Commons, he served as leader of the House of Lords and latterly as governor of Bermuda.

        "The Age UK review identified more than three million people aged over 65 with a care need, but found just two-thirds of them were actually getting help. The charity warned that the lack of support for the ageing population was risking their health. But ministers said steps were being taken to provide more help. The review used official data and existing research to identify how many people were struggling with everyday tasks and how many were getting help. There are 10 million people over the age of 65 in England, the review said, and more than 3 million struggle with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and going to the toilet. Just over one million pay for care or rely on family and friends with another 850,000 supported by their local councils. But that leaves another one million who have to fend for themselves. The report also warned that community NHS services and GPs were struggling to meet demand from the ageing population. And Age UK warned there were signs this was affecting the health of older people. It cited an 88 rise in hospital admissions for urinary tract infections among the over-75s between 2005-06 and 2013-14 to 4,173 per 100,000. Meanwhile, admissions for pneumonia among the over-60s have more than doubled over the same period to 2,621 per 100,000. Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said it was a \"destructive vicious circle\" where the lack of support was worsening the health of the most vulnerable older people in society. \"If an older person asked us today how confident we were that their health and care needs will be met well in the future we would be whistling in the dark if we gave a wholly reassuring answer.\" But a Department of Health spokeswoman said \"significant action\" was being taken to improve the support given to older people. She pointed out that all over-75s should now have a named GP to co-ordinate their care, while a PS5.3bn pot of money - mainly from NHS funds - has been set aside this year for joint projects between councils and health services.

        "The final member of the family, a male marmoset called Gomez, was found by police on Monday, having been abandoned on a vets' doorstep. A female and a baby were retrieved on Sunday, and are already back at Symbio Wildlife Park, south of Sydney. Two men have pleaded guilty to charges of dealing with proceeds of crime. Brothers Jesse and Jackson George are not believed to have snatched the monkeys from their enclosure, but they were charged with trying to profit from the theft. Pygmy marmosets - the world's smallest monkey species - command up to A5,000 (PS3,000, 3,700) on the black market. Police found the men after a tip-off from the public. A desperate appeal for information had been launched by the zoo, amid fears that the baby marmoset would die within 48 hours if unable to feed from its mother. The four-week-old was found when the Georges' car was pulled over at Appin, southwest of Sydney. The female marmoset was found about 20km (12 miles) away in the Campbelltown area. Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph said the brothers had exchanged marmoset pictures with a third person via mobile phone, along with messages about how much a monkey could sell for. \"Ay, check out my monkey,\" wrote the third person, according to court documents. \"That's mad bro. Wanna sell it bruh?\" Jackson George replied. The baby marmoset is now home and well, said Symbio Wildlife Park, after they reunited it with its mother. \"Mum cradled the baby straight into her arms and bub immediately began to feed,\" the zoo wrote in a statement on Facebook. Police say they are continuing their investigation into the theft. The zoo said the marmoset enclosure is currently closed \"to give the family privacy.\"",

        "Forty workers have been made redundant at Nelson Packaging's factory in Lancashire. Managing director Michael Flynn said it was mainly due to \"the English bag legislation and corresponding impact on customer and retailer demand.\" He also blamed \"aggressive overseas competition.\" The 5p charge for bags was introduced in England in October and followed the introduction of charges in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. One worker told BBC Radio Lancashire they believed the legislation had a \"slight but not a massive impact\" on the business, which has been operating since 1975 and was taken over by Cheshire-based packaging firm Intelipac three years ago. 7.6 billion Number of plastic bags issued by supermarkets in England in 2014 140 Equivalent per person 40 bags on average in every home PS780m expected economic benefit over 10 years because of the charge PS60m savings in litter clean up costs by 2025 80 expected reduction in bags Union representative Robert Copeland, who had been with the firm since 1986, said staff were told last Wednesday that they were being made redundant and were told to leave the factory immediately. \"It's daunting as I have no interview skills. I'm 49 years old and I've got to now go into a new working environment and start again. It is scary. \"I was 19 when I started and... you were seeing the children of people you have been working with for 30 years starting to come through so you had parents and children [at the factory].\" Campaigners argue that plastic bags blight streets, spoil the countryside and damage wildlife, seas and coastline. Wales was the first UK nation to introduce the bag charges, followed by Northern Ireland and then Scotland. A report in 2015 found the number of single-use carrier bags handed out by shops in Wales fell by 71 since charges were introduced in 2011. Scotland and Northern Ireland introduced their charges in 2014 and 2013 respectively and also saw significant drops in usage. The number of plastic bags handed out in Scottish stores was slashed by 80 - the equivalent of 650 million carriers - in the first year of the 5p charge. Similarly, in Northern Ireland in 2014 there was a 42.6 annual reduction following a previous drop of 71, after charges were introduced. Does the charge include all carrier bags?",
        "It was only the Scots' first match, but the history of this competition is not littered with teams who got off to losing starts and then recovered to qualify for the knockouts. Some have done it, of course. Bath and Wasps didn't just lose their opening match in this competition last season - they lost their opening two. And yet they both made the quarter-finals. In the story of how they did it, we see a glimpse of what Glasgow must do now in order to give themselves a chance of qualifying for that final eight. Wasps beat Castres and Harlequins away from home to qualify as one of the best runners-up. Bath beat Montpellier and Toulouse away - with a four-try bonus point - to make it as group winners. Those were major victories on the road and that is now the world that Glasgow have been plunged into in the wake of Saturday's loss to the Saints. The reality of European rugby hit them right between the eyes. The tea-leaves told us that Glasgow would win this. They had a stellar cast of international players. They had home advantage in the fortress of Scotstoun. And they had some form. Northampton had few of those things. They had lost three of their four games in the Aviva Premiership, albeit by narrow margins. From last season's quarter-final team, they were missing the front-row of Alex Corbisiero, Dylan Hartley and Salesi Ma'afu, who is now on Toulon's books. One of their go-to second-rows from last season, Samu Manoa, has also gone to Toulon and the other, Courtney Lawes, is injured. This was a new Saints pack at Scotstoun and yet they were convincing winners in every department. Glasgow had a beaten scrum and had a ropey line-out, they were second best in the collisions and error-prone at critical times. Warriors can get away with some of these things - and occasionally many of these things - in the more merciful environment of the Pro12. Not so in Europe. Certainly not against a team as rugged as Northampton, a side who spend their weekly lives engaged in dogfights in the Premiership. They were battle-hardened and clinical on Saturday in a way that Glasgow were not. The scrum wasn't even a contest. Northampton won six penalties in that area. They garnered six points and a sin-binning, which brought a converted try, from their overwhelming dominance in the scrum. Kieran Brookes, at tight-head, had a field day. They looked like men with twin targets - not just Champions Cup but, for some, the Six Nations. When Eddie Jones, the new England coach, gets a look at Brookes' performance, he's going to like what he sees. When he watches Luther Burrell, jettisoned by Stuart Lancaster, he's going to like it all the more. Burrell was top class. Northampton drive on. They were tougher, physically and mentally, than Glasgow. The group now looks like a scrap between them and Racing 92, who took five points from the Scarlets in Wales, unless Glasgow can find the kind of venom that typified the Saints. It was sobering stuff for coach Gregor Townsend. It's been an age since a team came to his own backyard and beat them up like Northampton did. In truth, there was a large element of self-harm about it as well. The game was in its relative infancy when Glasgow's composure went out the window. In failing to get close to a garryowen, Stuart Hogg set a hare running, the hare going by the name of George Pisi, who ploughed over under the posts. Then Glasgow's scrum came under fire. It went down, it went down, it went down. Three scrum penalties inside 19 minutes and Ryan Grant in the bin for the third. This was a new kind of examination for Townsend's Pro12 champions. The vulnerabilities carried on. Hogg missed a routine tackle on Ahsee Tuala and Saints were in again. Peter Horne, that stand-up guy in the Glasgow midfield, scored a try of his own to cut the deficit to eight points, but Stephen Myler stretched it to 11 before the break. Glasgow had enough ball to make a game of it. Even after Tuala scored his second try, the home team had a mountain of possession and any number of promising field positions. Eventually they scored, through Josh Strauss, but there were so many butchered moments in there too. A maul shunted backwards out of the Northampton 22, a knock-on when momentum was building, a dreadful under-throw from their new Georgian hooker, Shalva Mamukashvili, at a line-out five metres from the Northampton line. It was a recurring theme. Glasgow would inch forward, Scotstoun would rise to its feet and then Northampton would turn on the turbo defence and Glasgow would buckle. The thunderous defence of the visitors didn't just repel Glasgow physically, it damaged them mentally. Their intensity got into the Glasgow psyche. Saints messed with their heads all day. It was a deeply uncomfortable experience for the Pro12, in general, and, particularly, for those who believed in Glasgow's capacity to make the step up in Europe at last. They have a mountain of work ahead of them if they are to be relevant in this tournament this season. The hope has not been extinguished, but it's flickering.",

But health boards have been told to cut delays in transfers and discharges, equivalent to the loss of 16 beds. Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said continuous improvement was needed. He said the report \"highlights some of the excellent work taking place in critical care units and hospitals across Wales.\" The minister added: \"The report also identifies areas where more rapid improvement is needed and health boards must make sure they have robust plans in place to drive out inefficiencies in the system, such as delayed transfers of care.\"",
        "But there was nothing expected about the way his Manchester United side claimed their first away win of the season. \"If Arsenal had scored in the first 20 minutes then it is a different game,\" said the United boss. \"And then maybe I have to respond to all the questions asking why I chose the three centre-backs. But now I can laugh.\" The joke ended up being on Arsenal's attacking players rather than the unlikely trio of defenders that Van Gaal had picked - Chris Smalling, Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair - who surprisingly held out until Olivier Giroud's ferocious strike in stoppage time. Saturday evening's defeat was not the same old story for the Gunners either - they did not take the lead this time, for starters. And while we already knew that both teams are unlikely to mount a title challenge, there were still things to be learned from a game billed as the battle for fourth place. Media playback is not supported on this device It had taken United until the 85th minute to muster a shot on target, with Kieran Gibbs' bizarre own goal gifting them the lead before Wayne Rooney's late strike prevented the game finishing with that odd statistic. As well as his first away win as United boss, this was arguably the first win under Van Gaal that had been earned by his defence. Arsene Wenger was keen to point out that David De Gea was man of the match at Emirates Stadium but in truth the United keeper made a lot of saves he would be expected to make, rather than any truly outstanding ones. Or as Van Gaal put it: \"Most of his saves were from outside the area and from that distance the goalkeeper has more advantage than the player shooting.\" The biggest reason De Gea's recently dislocated finger was not truly tested was United's makeshift backline, something few people expected to be saying before this game when they saw the team sheet with the names of Smalling, McNair and Blackett on it. A fourth clean sheet of the season looked even less likely when one of the wing-backs, Luke Shaw, was forced off after 16 minutes to be replaced by Ashley Young - who according to his manager is not fully fit. At that stage, Arsenal were rampant and it seemed a case of when they would score, not if. But instead of collapsing, United stood firm. Smalling, who is not viewed as natural leader, marshalled the youngsters either side of him. In front of them, Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini added much-needed bite to midfield. Together they earned Van Gaal a win that moved his side up to fourth in the table - something he seemed surprised about when he was told. While United can - justifiably - claim to be making progress, the raw statistics demonstrate Arsenal are going backwards. A year ago, they beat Southampton 2-0 and were four points clear at the top of the table with 28 points from 12 games. Fast forward 12 months and Wenger's men have 11 points fewer at the same stage, and trail leaders Chelsea by 15 points. Yes, fourth place is still in their reach - United, in the last of the Champions League places, are only two points ahead. Framed like that, this campaign is not yet a disaster. Media playback is not supported on this device But after ending their trophy drought by winning the FA Cup, and following that up with a summer of heavy investment, Arsenal fans can be forgiven for thinking their title challenge should have lasted longer than it did last season, when it faded in the New Year. Instead it is all but over before most people have put their Christmas decorations up. Some are making their frustrations heard - such as the Gunners fan in front of the press box on Saturday who held aloft a sign reading \"Enough is Enough - Wenger out.\" But the majority remained with their manager on this occasion, perhaps because this defeat was unlike most of their setbacks this season. This time, it was misfortune that cost them the initiative in a game, rather than any ill-advised attempts to extend their lead. Gibbs' collision with Wojciech Szczesny that led to the full-back's own goal and ended the keeper's involvment in the game was pure farce. It would be unkind to compare the duo's actions to the antics of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, the stars of new film'Dumb and Dumber To' who were at Emirates Stadium to watch the game. But you get the feeling their characters Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne would definitely have approved. United's second goal was much more familiar to Arsenal fans, with their team being caught up the pitch and exposed on the break - but at least this time it was because they were chasing the game. Wenger's team have obvious shortcomings but they were not behind this defeat and his side did not get what they deserved against United. Instead it was just one of those nights.",

His wife, Ganna Ziuzina, had returned to a restaurant for a missing glove. The coroner at Exeter County Hall, Dr Elizabeth Earland, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. More on the millionaire'murdered' by his wife, and other news She said: \"His guard was lowered by inebriation. The car had stolen licence plates and did not brake or stop. \"I am satisfied that having heard all the evidence.... much of it circumstantial, nevertheless, in my view it is overwhelming. \"I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Barry John Pring has been unlawfully killed.\" She said the case demonstrated the difficulty in investigating a case of a death abroad, adding: \"Our thoughts and condolences must go to the family who have endured years and years of distress and unhappiness.\" Close friend Peter Clifford, a lawyer, told the inquest he had \"no reasonable doubt\" that Barry was murdered. Ms Ziuzina, known as Anna, was 19 years younger than her husband. She tried to claim his assets within days of his death. His family believe he was killed in a staged hit and run accident. The couple met online in 2006 and were married in 2007 following a four-day engagement.

She said: \"We are sure Anna had some involvement in his death to inherit his money and property. \"I was quite surprised how cold she was with Barry. She did not lift a finger, she was a lazy thing.\" The inquest heard Ms Ziuzina sold her husband's Range Rover, contents from his flat and moved funds from his bank account. The hearing was also told she was \"entitled to the first PS200,000 of his estate\" and that computer records revealed \"she was having an affair with a Ukrainian man.\" Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland said \"strenuous attempts\" had been made to get her to attend the inquest, but without success. In a statement, Ms Ziuzina said she had made \"three separate statements to Ukrainian police\" and did not believe she could \"add anything further.\" Det Con Jonathan Watts, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said Mr Pring was hit by a car with no lights, speeding at 75mph. He also said witnesses at the scene in Kiev described the killing \"as a deliberate act.\" The Ukrainian police closed an inquiry into his death, but relaunched it in 2011 as a murder inquiry.

Critics have said republicans have yet to propose a viable alternative to being a constitutional monarchy. Australians voted against becoming a republic in a 1999 referendum. Mr Turnbull - who was leading the republican movement at that time - said he had \"no doubt in the future there will be another referendum, and the matter will be decided, as it should be, by the Australian people.\" \"But the timing of that referendum has to be right,\" he said, repeating his view that it should not take place until the end of the Queen's reign. \"I've led the'yes' case for a republic into a heroic defeat once, I've got no desire to do so again,\" he told reporters at an Australia Day event in Canberra. Lt Gen Morrison was named Australian of the Year at a ceremony in Canberra on Monday in recognition of his commitment to gender equality. He famously ordered soldiers who could not accept women as equals to \"get out\" of the Australian military in a speech in 2013. In his speech, he also praised the outgoing holder of the title, Rosie Batty, a high-profile campaigner against domestic violence. He described her as \"the most remarkable woman\" who had \"set a benchmark for us all.\" The Australian of the Year is nominated by the public and chosen by a panel, in recognition of their contribution to Australian society. As well as an Australian of the Year, there is also a Senior Australian of the Year (a doctor, Professor Gordian Fulde, this year), a Young Australian of the Year (entrepreneurs Nic Marchesi and Lucas Patchett) and Australia's Local Hero (Youth educator Dr Catherine Keenan).",
        "Arthur Cory, 49, said the flag had been kept in a cupboard at Penllyn Castle near Cowbridge, since he was a boy. The flag, one of only three surviving from the battle, is expected to fetch up to PS50,000 at auction. It is said to have flown above Nelson's warship HMS Leviathan. The flag's \"most probable\" route to Penllyn Castle was through Mr Cory's ancestor Nicholas Cory, a rear admiral on William IV's Royal George yacht, the auction house said. Roland Elworthy, senior valuer at Holt's Auctioneers, said he had \"no doubt as to the flag's provenance.\"",
        "Experts say a lack of early support means patients are reaching crisis. Data compiled for the BBC by NHS Digital showed that between 2011-12 and 2015-16 the number of patients attending AE units with psychiatric problems rose by nearly 50 to 165,000. For the under 18s alone the numbers almost doubled to nearly 22,000. These figures represent a small minority of overall AE attendances - just over 1 in total. But the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said that was likely to be the \"tip of the iceberg\" as these figures just included cases where the primary diagnosis was a psychiatric condition. Patients coming in with self-harm or after an attempted suicide may have been recorded as having a different reason for attending hospital. Some trusts the BBC spoke to said as many as a tenth of patients were attending AE because of mental health problems. A 999 call comes in. The man says he is ill, he's hearing voices and wants to kill someone. Usually emergency services would be despatched and he'd probably be taken to an already overstretched accident and emergency department. But in Birmingham, the street triage team is sent with a paramedic, police officer and psychiatric nurse on board. By intervening at this stage, they aim to get the patient appropriate help and ease pressures on AE - the man has been taken there about half a dozen times already in the last few weeks. After talking to the team and physical health checks, it's agreed he'll remain at home and keep an appointment in the morning. The initiative set up by the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust has reduced the numbers in mental health crisis going to AEs locally. As part of RAID - Rapid Assessment, Interface and Discharge - psychiatric teams are also based in emergency departments. They aim to see people with psychiatric problems within an hour. Dr Peter Aitken, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the figures were \"extremely concerning\" \"Years of underfunding has meant these children have not been able to benefit from early intervention.\" He said AEs needed to invest in specialist psychiatric services to ensure people with mental health problems got the right support. \"Mental health presentations to AE are unlikely to be minor as they represent an urgent crisis point in a person's life,\" he added. Dr Marc Bush, chief policy adviser at the charity Young Minds, said: \"Far too many young people end up in AE, which can be crowded and stressful, because there's nowhere more appropriate for them to go. \"One of the main reasons that crisis services are so overstretched is that young people who are struggling don't get help soon enough, which means that problems often escalate. \"Unless we see greater investment in early intervention, the numbers will continue to rise.\" The figures have been revealed just a day after the prime minister announced a package of measures to support people with mental health problems. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: \"As the prime minister has made clear this week - improvements must be made in mental health care both within and outside of the NHS, to make sure people get the support they need before they reach crisis point.\" She said extra money being invested in the NHS this Parliament would help ensure improvements take place.",
        "The weir, built as a permanent wooden structure to catch fish as the tide ebbed, was found by chance on the shore of Southampton Water in 2005. Radiocarbon dating has shown it was built in the 8th or 9th centuries. Experts from Exeter University said the results were \"thrilling\" and provided new insights into the process of coastal erosion in the area. The 70m-long (500ft) structure was found by chance close to the Fawley oil refinery by archaeology students more than 10 years ago. Tests showed the structure was built between 680AD and 896AD. Marine archaeologist Dr John Cooper said the discovery has allowed historians to map changes to the shoreline over 1,000 years as it was covered by advancing saltmarsh which later retreated, gradually exposing the structure over the past century. \"It has highlighted the level of erosion in Southampton Water over the last few decades. There are factors like sea level rise and dredging carried out but it shows how dynamic coastal change is.\" He said the wooden structures, once exposed are vulnerable to shipworm and are likely to continue erode away. Some of the posts and wickerwork have already vanished since the initial find in 2005.",
        "The RAC said the higher prices were due to a combination of rising crude oil prices, and the devaluation of the pound after June's Brexit vote. Average petrol prices rose by 4.4p to 116.7p per litre and average diesel prices rose 5.2p to 118.7p per litre. The motoring body said these were the biggest monthly increases for three and a half years. Its fuel spokesman, Simon Williams, said retailers had \"no choice\" but to put up prices on garage forecourts. \"The effects of the weak pound have really been felt on the wholesale market, and this, combined with an oil price at nearly double its lowest level in 2016, has put significant upward pressure on wholesale fuel prices,\" he said. \"Certainly, we are a long way from the remarkably low fuel prices enjoyed by families and businesses early in 2016, when the average price of unleaded was around 102p per litre and diesel was 101p,\" he added. According to the RAC, the increases mean it now costs PS64.20 to fill the 55-litre petrol tank of a typical family car. Meanwhile it costs PS65.25 to fill up a similarly sized tank in a diesel car. The RAC suggested that the price of fuel might stabilise in the coming months. \"Opec, which represents some of the world's biggest oil producers, recently agreed in principle a cut in production,\" said Mr Williams. \"But a final deal is still to be agreed at an Opec meeting at the end of this month and, with some analysts suggesting a deal might yet stall, this leaves open the prospect oil prices might stabilise or even fall before the end of the year,\" he added.",
        "Isis Academy in Oxford said it had rebranded as \"Iffley Academy\" to protect its \"reputation, integrity and image.\" The name'Isis' was originally chosen as the school is near to the section of the River Thames of the same name. Formerly Iffley Mead School, it became Isis Academy in 2013. A statement issued by the school said it had changed name following \"the unforeseen rise of ISIS (also known as ISIL and the Islamic State) and related global media coverage of the activities of the group.\" \"Our priority is to remove the detrimental impact which the name'Isis' had on pupils, their families and our staff.\" Last year a language school in the city removed Isis from its name for the same reason. The Isis is the name given to the part of the River Thames above Iffley Lock in Oxford. It is also the name of the goddess wife of the god Osiris in Egyptian beliefs.",
        "During the first nine months of 1938, he oversaw the Czech Kindertransport, which brought Jewish children from German-occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK. He worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees. Yet, amazingly, his self-effacing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge. Nicholas George Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in the well-heeled Hampstead district of north London. His Jewish parents had moved from Germany to London in 1907 and changed the family name from Wertheim to Winton. They had also converted to Christianity and it was into that faith that their son was baptised. In 1923, Winton became one of the first pupils at the newly opened Stowe School in Buckinghamshire. Although he left without attaining any qualifications, he had become imbued with a love of mathematics. He continued his studies at evening classes before moving to Germany, where he worked in banks in Hamburg and Berlin. In 1931, just two years before Hitler became German chancellor, he moved to work in Paris before returning to London. His mother's family had remained in Germany and that, together with the stories of Jewish refugees fleeing to London, made him all too aware of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis. In December 1938, Winton had been due to go on a skiing holiday to Switzerland when he suddenly decided to travel instead to Prague, where a friend was trying to help Jewish refugees. He visited camps for refugees from the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia, which had been ceded to Germany in September 1938 following pressure on the Czech government from Britain and France. British activists were already working in Czechoslovakia trying to help the refugees, but Winton's great idea was to rescue children by finding families in the UK to give them a home. He was helped by a 1938 Act of Parliament that permitted the entry of refugee children under the age of 17, as long as money was deposited to pay for their eventual return home. Winton set up an office in a hotel in Prague, where he was quickly besieged by families desperate to get their children out before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. On his return to London, he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport, just one of a number of initiatives attempting to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories. Winton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home. It was not always easy. \"The problem was getting the people who would accept the children, and of course this was at a time when the evacuation of children from the south [of England] was taking place anyway,\" he said. \"It's marvellous that so many people did come forward. The unfortunate thing was that no other country would come along and help. \"I tried America but they didn't take any. It would have made a vast difference if they had.\" In the first eight months of 1939, eight trains left Prague taking 669 children to safety. A further 15 were flown out via Sweden. The ninth train was scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland and triggered the outbreak of World War Two. \"Within hours of the announcement, the train disappeared,\" Winton later recalled. \"None of the 250 children on board was seen again. \"We had families waiting at Liverpool Street that day in vain. If the train had been a day earlier, it would have come through.\" Winton registered as a conscientious objector and served for a time as an ambulance driver, before joining the RAF where he was eventually commissioned. He told no-one about his pre-war exploits and it was not until 1988 that his wife discovered a scrapbook in the attic containing a mass of documents, including the names of the rescued children. In July of that year, Winton appeared on an edition of the BBC programme That's Life, and some of the people he had rescued were invited to attend. Until they arrived in the studio, they had no idea that Winton was the man who had saved them. Winton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield care homes and, in 2003, was knighted in recognition of his efforts on the Kindertransport. In 2007, he received the Czech Republic's highest military decoration, the Cross of the 1st Class, and was nominated by the Czech government for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize. A train dubbed \"The Winton Train\" left Prague station on 1 September 2009, exactly 70 years after the last Kindertransport had been due to depart from the Czech capital. In October 2014, at the age of 105, he travelled to Prague to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, the Order of the White Lion. In his acceptance speech, he was typically modest: \"In a way, I shouldn't have lived so long to give everyone the opportunity to exaggerate things the way they are doing today.\" It was another Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who summed up the vital role of those who, like Winton, tried to save Europe's Jewish children from the Nazis: \"In those times there was darkness everywhere. In Heaven and on Earth, all the gates of compassion seemed to have been closed. \"The killer killed and the Jews died and the outside world adopted an attitude either of complicity or of indifference. Only a few had the courage to care.\"",
        "Now without a win in 12 league matches on home soil - a run that dates back to March - the Dons twice held a two-goal lead before Taylor rescued an unlikely point for Rovers. Dean Bowditch opened the scoring for the hosts after 16 minutes from close range when goalkeeper Kelle Roos spilt a 20-yard strike from Ben Reeves. Lively winger Ryan Colclough thundered a shot against the crossbar before defender George Williams nodded his first Dons goal via a post in the 24th minute. Bowditch headed inches wide on the half hour as the hosts went close to making it 3-0. Taylor threw Rovers a lifeline just 66 seconds after the break with a superb right-foot strike from 20 yards. Dons' nerves eased again when Reeves cut inside in the 66th minute to restore the two-goal gap. Rovers' more physical second-half approach left Dons boss Karl Robinson livid on the touchline and his back line finally cracked as Taylor pounced twice from close range in the 87th and 89th minutes.

        "The proposed deal would combine the second and third largest cable operators in the US. Charter is also buying Bright House Networks, another cable operator, for 10.4bn. The combined three firms will serve cable television and broadband to 23.9 million customers in 41 states. Charter will pay about 55bn in cash and stock for Time Warner Cable, with the balance of the 78.7bn valuation coming from TWC's debts. US cable companies are facing stiff competition from online service providers such as Amazon and Netflix, as customers increasingly choose to stream films and television shows over the internet at a time of their convenience. Cable companies are responding by trying to cut costs and improve the quality of their shows. The new merged cable giant will compete with US cable market leader Comcast, which currently has about 27 million customers. Charter's takeover move comes a month after Comcast abandoned its plan to buy Time Warner Cable fearing pressure from regulators. The latest deal is also likely to come under regulatory scrutiny, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) quickly issued a statement. \"The FCC reviews every merger on its merits and determines whether it would be in the public interest,\" FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said. \"In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient. The commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved.\" The merged company would still be smaller than Comcast, which serves about a third of US broadband customers, said analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson Research. \"One has to be sober about genuine risks that this deal could still be rejected,\" he added. Liberty Broadband, which currently owns about a quarter of Charter, is expected to own about 20 of the new company. The deal values Time Warner Cable at 195.71 per share.",
        "The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood, who visited Brussels this week, is in no doubt. He described the prospect of the UK's withdrawal from Europe as \"the biggest immediate threat to the economy of Northern Ireland and to the island as a whole.\" He insisted a Brexit - the inelegant shorthand for Britain leaving Europe - \"would undermine and destabilise the fabric of successive Anglo-Irish agreements.\" It would \"undermine and destabilise our north-south institutions,\" he added, and would \"resurrect borders and resurrect barriers for business.\" In Northern Ireland Questions in the House of Commons, the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Sammy Wilson took the opposite view. He maintained a vote to leave the EU would \"help the Northern Ireland economy insofar as it would release PS18bn every year for expenditure on public services.\" He also said it would \"enable us to enter a trade agreement with growing parts of the world and release us from the stifling bureaucracies of Europe.\" Finance Minister Mervyn Storey, Mr Wilson's DUP colleague, attended an event this week to welcome the allocation of more than PS400m in EU peace and cross-border funding for Northern Ireland. Earlier this month, Emma Pengelly, another DUP minister, described the peace money and the European Task Force on Northern Ireland as \"essential to making Northern Ireland work and building that better future we want to see.\" At the same time, DUP politicians tell you it is only right that Northern Ireland should get its share, pointing out that the UK puts PS1.50 into the European pot for every PS1 it gets back. In the Commons, the SDLP, the Scottish National Party and the Labour Party appeared to be intent on exposing the difference between what they termed the \"mixed messages\" emanating from the Eurosceptic Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Ben Wallace, her Europhile junior minister. When it came to calculating the amount Britain puts into Europe, Mr Wilson set the bar high at PS18bn. Both the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds and First Minister Arlene Foster recently quoted far more conservative estimates of about PS9bn. That, coincidentally, is about the same amount as Northern Ireland's fiscal deficit with Westminster, according to the latest Stormont budget. This BBC backgrounder opts for a UK EU contribution figure of PS11.3bn. Mr Dodds told the BBC's Question Time that Northern Ireland and the UK could survive quite well outside the EU. Both he and Mrs Foster are sticking to the official DUP line that they will not make their minds up definitively until Prime Minister David Cameron has completed his negotiations for EU reform. But given Mr Wilson's belief that Mr Cameron's renegotiation is doomed to fail, and the DUP MEP Diane Dodds' previous criticism of the prime minister's \"barrenness of ambition,\" it appears almost certain that the DUP will end up campaigning for EU withdrawal, together with the Tradional Unionist Voice and the UK Independence Party. The SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party will be in the pro EU camp. The Ulster Unionists are still in wait-and-see mode. If Mr Cameron does opt for a summer referendum, voters in Northern Ireland will barely have time to recover from May's assembly election before they are asked to go to the polls again. The campaign will no doubt feature plenty of financial arguments, not just about the UK's membership fees but also regarding the impact of any withdrawal on future trade between the UK and the rest of the EU. Mrs Foster told me she would like more clarity about Westminster's plans for Northern Ireland's financial subvention in the event of the UK leaving the EU and the consequent loss of peace and cross-border cash. Whether she gets such clarity is doubtful, given that the prime minister may be reluctant to contemplate such a possibility. Away from the numbers game, with the Irish government watching on with concern and nationalists and unionists likely to be polarised, expect plenty of good old-fashioned traditional politics. Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson has said a Brexit \"could see the re-emergence of passport checkpoints and customs controls\" along the Irish border that would hinder \"free movement and disrupt the lives of nearly a million people living in the border region.\" Mrs Foster said that is \"scaremongering\" and appears convinced that \"practical solutions\" will mean cross-border trade and the free movement of people would continue unaffected. Just like the Scottish independence referendum, the EU campaign in Northern Ireland may ultimately be more about hearts and minds than it is about facts and figures.",

        "Briton Eleanor Hawkins, Canadians Lindsey and Danielle Peterson, and Dutchman Dylan Snel admitted causing a public disturbance. The group was blamed for a magnitude 5.9 earthquake after stripping on Mount Kinabalu, which is considered sacred. They were jailed for three days, but their sentences were back-dated to reflect time already served. A judge at Kota Kinabalu Magistrates' Court said the four had shown remorse and ordered the jail terms to run from 9 June, meaning the group is free to leave. He also fined each defendant 5,000 Malaysian ringgit (PS8601,330). The BBC's Jennifer Pak, who was in court, said she understood the group were now waiting to pay their fines before being deported. Hawkins' lawyer Ronny Cham said the 23-year-old, from Draycott in Derbyshire, would be freed from police custody later on Friday and her release documentation was being arranged. She would then fly home to the UK on Saturday, her lawyer said. Her father Timothy Hawkins said the sentence was \"appropriate and fair\" but it appeared she had been \"treated pretty badly\" amid the media scrum outside court. \"She's obviously very traumatised,\" he said. \"Eleanor knows what she did was wrong and disrespectful and she is deeply sorry for any offence she has caused to the Malaysian people.\" Foreign coverage of the story has been criticised in the Malaysian press. Several local newspapers accused British tabloids of exaggerating reports that the tourists were arrested for causing the quake, rather than the actual charge of public indecency. The Sabah-based Daily Express accused the papers of running \"sensational\" headlines, while the country's most popular English-language paper, The Star, said reports (pictured) alleging Hawkins and the others were arrested for angering mountain gods \"couldn't be further from the truth.\" Tourism minister, Masidi Manjun, said their acts would have merited punishment for breaking local laws and norms whether or not the earthquake took place. Mr Masidi, who comes from the foothills of Mount Kinabalu, was also quoted in the Malay Mail as saying there had been some \"fact-twisting\" by foreign media. \"I don't know whether this is on purpose just to ridicule us, or their failure to appreciate our local traditions and customs,\" he said. Speaking to reporters outside his home, Mr Hawkins said the family were looking forward to his daughter's return. \"We do not know when this will be as we've had no contact from the High Consulate in Malaysia, and we've not spoken to Ellie,\" he said. She and her co-accused all admitted a charge of \"committing an obscene act in public.\" Prosecutors said the four tourists, along with six others, climbed the peak to enjoy the sunrise on 30 May and then challenged each other to take off their clothes. But the court amended the facts to agree the accused did not tell the guide to \"shut up\" or \"go to hell,\" as the prosecution had alleged. Their lawyer said they had simply ignored pleas not to remove their clothes, and had not verbally abused the guide. Mr Cham, who representing all four defendants, said they were ignorant of local customs and \"their act had brought shame and ridicule upon themselves and their respective countries.\" He asked the judge to not make an example of them, saying the intense international media coverage had traumatised them enough. The prosecution argued the public interest was central to the case and, according to Malaysian law, anyone committing an \"obscene act\" which causes annoyance in a public place should be jailed for up to three months. Many Malaysians had been outraged by the group's behaviour, he said, and the case was about \"upholding the [country's] morals and customs.\" Earlier, the four arrived at court accompanied by officials wearing balaclavas. The accused covered their faces as they entered the building, surrounded by a media scrum. \"There's a lot of public anger still against the tourists because many of them believe Mount Kinabalu is a sacred spot where their souls go to rest when they die,\" Ms Pak said. \"The fact that these foreigners are alleged to have stripped on the peak, urinated and cursed at staff members trying to stop them is something that many locals say is disrespectful.\" Last Friday, an earthquake struck killing 18 people, including children, and leaving hundreds more stranded. Sabah state deputy chief minister Joseph Pairin Kitingan blamed it on the travellers showing \"disrespect to the sacred mountain.\" News agency AFP said police were still seeking five other suspects but some were thought to have already left Sabah.",

Another former world number one, Lee Westwood, is two shots further back after a 67, with 16 players within five strokes of the lead. Donald, 37, who has not won since November 2013, said: \"I've put myself in a good position. I'd love to shoot another round like this and if I did I think that might be good enough.\" Welshman Bradley Dredge, seeking his first European Tour title since 2006, withdrew shortly before the start of the round because of a viral infection. The 42-year-old, who lost his tour card in 2012 but regained it after finishing 81st on the Race to Dubai last year, had been only two shots off the lead.",
        "The screenplay has been written by Eric Roth - who won an Oscar for Forrest Gump. Leakey is former head of the Kenya Wildlife Service and was key to stemming the trade in illegal ivory. \"I've felt a deep connection to Africa and its culture for much of my life,\" said Jolie. Leakey's extreme measures to tackle poachers, including sending helicopter gunships into the national park, have helped Kenya's elephant and rhino populations recover from the brink of disaster. He made international headlines in 1989, when a stockpile of 12 tonnes of ivory was burned in Nairobi National Park. Jolie said Africa is about \"a man drawn into the violent conflict with elephant poachers, who emerged with a deeper understanding of man's footprint and a profound sense of responsibility for the world around him.\" Producer David Ellison - whose company Skydance co-produced films including True Grit and Jack Reacher - called Leakey \"inspirational,\" adding, \"Africa is a story that deserves to be told.\" Jolie's next movie, Unbroken, starring British actor Jack O'Connell is due in cinemas later this year. She is currently directing and starring opposite her husband Brad Pitt in the film By The Sea, based on her own screenplay.",
        "If you leave your mobile phone somewhere do you worry you will not be able to check it? If any of this sounds familiar, there is a chance you could be spending too much time on social networks. An exclusive online Newsbeat poll suggests that a quarter of 15 to 18-year-olds in the UK feel happier online than they do in real life. Dr Radha from The Surgery on Radio 1 has dealt with patients who have displayed \"a lot of social anxiety\" because they are using social networks too much. \"Being online can provoke a sense of'I'm not good enough, everyone else is having an amazing life',\" she explained. \"It doesn't give us a sense of reality and actually what you will find is most people are probably doing the same thing as you are.\" The survey, carried out last month, also suggests a third of 15 to 18-year-olds have met someone in person they originally met through social media. Dr Radha has said it is important people carefully consider what information they share with the online community. \"What this survey showed is a lot of people go online alone,\" she said. \"In terms of our personal details and how we respond to messages from other people, we need to make sure we are looking after all of that safely.\" Dr Radha was concerned that some people feel safer dealing with people online, rather than in person. \"The more time we spend online, the less we are able to develop our social skills,\" she explained. \"When you are online you're not getting eye contact with people or perceiving how body language is changing, so as a result what people are saying can be misinterpreted. \"Physical contact, like a hug and a kiss, is really important. You don't get that kind of emotional confidence from being online.\" If your online activity is leaving you feeling anxious, Dr Radha has advised that you should \"slowly try to wean yourself off it.\" She said: \"If you are worrying,'what's going on? What am I missing?' It's a sign that being online too much is quite bad for you. \"Give yourself some rules by saying,'I'm only going to check things three times a day for this amount of time'.\" BBC Radio 1's The Surgery with Aled and Dr Radha is on Wednesday's at 9pm.

        "Energy firm Island Gas Limited (IGas) wants to carry out test drilling on Springs Road, in Misson, Bassetlaw. Campaign group Bassetlaw Against Fracking said the drilling operation would be \"devastating\" for wildlife. Nottinghamshire County Council said the application did not include proposals for hydraulic fracturing - better known as fracking. IGas has applied to carry out test drilling to check the suitability of the rock for shale gas extraction, through fracking. A separate application would have to be made to carry out fracking. IGas plans to develop one vertical exploratory shale gas well, drilling for about 14 weeks, and possibly a second horizontal well, drilling for about 19 weeks. During drilling, operations would take place 24 hours a day. The authority said at the project's peak there would be an average of 18 heavy goods vehicles and 10 light vehicles visiting the site each day. David Larder, campaign group chairman, said: \"We object to the 24 hour a day drilling for several months. The noise of this operation and the vibration will have a devastating effect upon the wildlife.\" Sally Gill, planning manager for the county council, said: \"If permission is granted, the test drilling would allow IGas to evaluate the potential resource of shale gas trapped beneath the surface. \"Depending on the results of the test drilling, IGas may, or may not, seek permission to extract the shale gas using fracking, but that would require a separate planning application which would be subject to further consultation.\" Before this stage of the exploration process, the company is required to monitor methane levels in groundwater for 12 months. A separate application has been submitted, which is yet to be considered.",

        "The European research centre announced its spoof discovery with pictures showing its scientists using The Force in everyday life. It was one of many April Fools jokes seen on websites around the world. Others included a selfie shoe, driverless pizza delivery and thought-powered web search. \"The Force is what gives a particle physicist his powers,\" said Cern scientist Ben Kenobi of the University of Mos Eisley, Tatooine in a press release. Many scientists at the centre were already using The Force, said the release, to communicate over long distances, influence minds and for \"lifting heavy things out of swamps.\" Microsoft used the background image for its main Bing search page to tout its April Fools joke in which it claimed the search system could read palms and minds to ensure people got the results they really wanted. Anyone could try thought-powered search by putting their right hand on a screen where the Bing homepage indicated. \"The innovative new search function intelligently analyses the electrical signals transmitted through the hand to calculate the relevant search term,\" said the software firm. Many other firms and sites produced spoof announcements and products for 1 April. Smartphone maker Samsung produced a spoof page for a Blade edge version of its Galaxy smartphone that, it claimed, was designed for cooks. The limited edition handset incorporates a diamond-edged blade so the phone can also be used to chop food when it is not being used for calls, texts, or browsing the web. HTC joined in with fake product pages for the Re-Sok - the \"world's first truly smart sock.\" The technology-enhanced footwear is engineered with GPS so pairs of socks can easily find each other and have an automatic hole warning system to alert owners when their intelligent footwear is running thin. For its April Fools parody, Motorola went to the trouble of making a lavish video showing two craftsmen producing selfie-sticks out of wood and leather. New York-based footwear maker Miz Mooz joined in and produced a pair of shoes that have smartphone docking ports in each toe so each one can be used to take selfies.

The first offence alleges he used \"offensive, inappropriate and unprofessional\" language after being sent off. Watson featured in every Six Nations game for England this year as they won their first Grand Slam since 2003. England tour Australia in June and Watson's place may be in doubt if he is found guilty of a dangerous tackle at a hearing on Tuesday, with the charge carrying a top end sanction of 10 weeks. If found guilty, the minimum punishment is a two-week suspension.

        "The watchdogs, which have been going for 40 years, want higher profiles as bodies which can raise concerns about the NHS when things go wrong. They admit public awareness is \"poor\" and a \"real weakness.\" It is set against a background of controversy about hospital reorganisations, AE waiting times, ambulance response times. We asked Peter Meredith-Smith, director of the Wales board of Community Health Councils, (CHCs) about the challenges facing the network of eight watchdogs across Wales. He is a former nurse and an ex-official with the Royal College of Nursing and has also been a senior official involved in nursing and mental health with the Welsh government. Is the biggest problem facing CHCs that patients do not know who you are and how to make a complaint? The public that engage with the CHCs very much value the role that we play in overseeing their NHS and are appreciative of the support they receive when they need help in raising concerns. However, it is disappointing that we have been described as \"the best kept secret in Wales.\" One of our highest priorities going forward is to increase public awareness of CHCs. As the statutory NHS Wales watchdog we represent public and patient interests in healthcare, so it is important that they know we exist and how we can help them. Lack of public awareness of the CHCs' independent advocacy service was a finding within Keith Evans's review of NHS complaints handling last year; we are addressing that now. Is this about persuading the public that CHCs are independent bodies which work in their interest, rather than in the interest of health boards or the government - has this been a problem in the past? As statutory, independent bodies representing the interests of the public and patient in health, the CHCs always put the interests of the public we serve at the heart of our work. Our regulations, which have just been reviewed, underpin our role and our independence from the NHS that we scrutinise. Notwithstanding this, it is essential that we enjoy a trusting and constructive relationship with the NHS organisations across Wales that we oversee. We work closely with them to ensure services are safe and represent the patient interest in any service changes proposed. What three issues have you as a group been seeing over the past 12-18 months which keep coming up? The first is probably the major concern relating to the pressures on accident and emergency departments across Wales and the UK as a whole. This is a serious systemic issue, resulting in ambulances being unable to discharge patients in a timely way. The second, relating to this, is the generally high level of delayed transfers of care, where hospital beds are needlessly occupied because of problems discharging them to community-based care. The third relates to the delays in actually realising \"integrated healthcare.\" There are some good examples of best practice, but the bridge between health and social care is still a very narrow one. If I had a concern about the care of a relative in a nursing home - or even in his or her own home - how would you like to see it work in future? The CHCs have a right to inspect the NHS care received by a resident in any care home setting. As part of our programme of collaboration with other inspectorates, we are currently working closely with the Older People's Commissioner in Wales and will also be approaching Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales, (CCSIW) to see how we can deliver more comprehensive healthcare scrutiny for residents in nursing home environments. NHS care is just one aspect of this; we need to ensure that the care home environment as a whole preserves the dignity and overall well-being of the resident. You are looking to work more closely with bodies like Healthcare Inspectorate Wales and the Older People's Commissioner. Is how the NHS is monitored too bureaucratic? We have learned much from the Francis Inquiry into the Mid Staffs Foundation Trust, which said that when public bodies responsible for protecting the interests of patients fail to collaborate \"the consequences can be disastrous.\" It is quite clear that CHCs must work closely with bodies such as HIW, CSSIW and the Older Peoples' Commissioner. CHCs represent the public and patient - it is vital that intelligence derived from this vital source is aggregated and fused with intelligence from other sources. Given the size and increasing complexity of the NHS, as well as the changing demographic healthcare needs, we must pool intelligence in order to identify the crisis points quickly and do something about them. What can you practically do about an issue like ambulance waiting times, for instance? The issue of pressures on ambulance service across Wales is a very serious one. It features high on the list of issues of concern raised with us by the public. It is also regularly at the top of agenda during our regular engagement meetings with health board directors. This issue is symptomatic of systemic problems with the health and social services in Wales. We are working hard locally and nationally to ensure that health service planners and providers improve things. We are working with the Welsh Ambulance Service on very practical day-to-day issues and are part of the Welsh government project that is looking at developing whole systems solutions to very real challenges relating to unscheduled care that we are experiencing in Wales. Patients have been very vocal about protecting local hospital services, especially in more rural areas. Are they really being listened to? A vital CHC function is public-patient engagement. It is a two-way process; we listen to the public and convey those concerns to the NHS service provider. In turn, we must understand why services need to change and pass that understanding to patients. Accessing services in rural areas is a key area, where distance and transport issues can be exceptionally worrying. For example, maternity services, stroke services and care of the frail and elderly, where time is of the essence. We work hard to ensure that these concerns are included in LHB [local health board] planning processes. Safety is key safe services as locally as possible', as opposed to,'local services as safely as possible' is a major factor. All too often the public feel that they have not been listened too, eroding the trust and confidence they have in the LHB. Can you strike a balance though - do you also need to make the case for change, which is advocated by professional bodies like the royal colleges, for example? What clinicians say regarding the safety and effectiveness of services is vital and we always give careful consideration to what they have to say. The CHCs are responsible for representing the crucial \"lay interest\" in health service issues and what \"real effect\" the changes have on local populations. It is becoming more and more the case that certain healthcare services are centralised in fewer centres of excellence, often meaning that the patient has to travel further to access it, but the care and outcome is considerably improved. We work hard to ensure that any decisions made properly factor in the public and patient opinion, and that LHBs, in particular, pay this due regard and allow time to factor this in. Can you identify weaknesses in the way CHCs have been operating up until now. How can the system become more effective in future - what have you achieved since the Longley review? Since the Longley Review of CHCs was published in 2012, our board has been working hard to address the recommendations made in this important report. The most recent Welsh government consultation on our regulations has taken account of these. In future the seven CHCs across Wales will be working to consistent standards, but at the same time maintaining our local \"reach,\" sensitive to local differences. The CHC board will monitor these standards. We have already reviewed our advocacy service and work is in hand to introduce common standards to this important service, as well as our inspection and engagement functions. We will also be developing our relationships with other bodies like HIW, CSSIW and the Older People's Commissioner - that has been a weakness in the past. We have now produced a statement of strategic intent, which will focus our functional development over the period 2015-2018. How exactly will you strengthen collaboration with other health bodies like the Health Inspectorate Wales? We have already developed a protocol with HIW which allows for regular and routine exchange of information and intelligence and the potential for joint inspections. In 2014, we carried out a number of GP inspections across Wales together and we will look to mount more of these. This will be formally exchanged at our annual conference in Cardiff. Work is also ongoing with the Older People's Commissioner to examine how we can more effectively represent the interests of care home residents. Does Prof June Andrews's report and other examples of concerns about standards of care demonstrate weaknesses? Unfortunately they do. The NHS is a human service and occasionally things go wrong. When they do, we need to acknowledge and recognise them and ensure that they form part of the learning process to prevent them happening again. Many of the recent reviews, like the Andrews' Report and the Evans' Review comment that health boards must have intimate contact with what is happening on their frontline - the wards for instance. The CHC work closely with LHBs to ensure that any shortfalls are dealt with quickly and effectively. How do you get the public to engage more with your work. Are you user-friendly enough? One of our primary objectives going forward is to further develop our public patient engagement strategy. This is a vital function - we cannot act as the patient's voice unless we reach out to them, right at the local level - and they can reach us with their comments and experiences. Do CHCs in general need to be more outspoken? Notably North Wales CHC has been particularly public in its criticism of recent decisions on changing obstetric services by Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board? The public need to have confidence that we will represent their healthcare interests at every opportunity in an honest, transparent, and visible way. We work closely with LHBs and they are legally obliged to keep us informed of any service changes right from the start. We also have the statutory right to refer any concerns that we cannot resolve locally direct to the health minister. In north Wales, the CHC acted on public concerns relating to obstetric services and brought those concerns to the attention of the health minister.",

        "Under the policy, the US has formal ties with China rather than the island of Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province. In a TV interview on Sunday, Mr Trump said he saw no reason why this should continue without key concessions. China urged Mr Trump to understand the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that the \"One China\" policy was the basis for relations with Washington. China's hawkish Global Times tabloid dubbed Mr Trump \"ignorant as a child.\" \"I fully understand the'One China' policy, but I don't understand why we have to be bound by the'One China' policy unless we make a deal with China, having to do with other things, including trade.\" The US was being hurt by Chinese currency devaluation, tariffs, the building of a \"massive fortress\" in the South China Sea, and a failure to help over North Korea's nuclear ambitions, he told Fox News. The comments come hot on the heels of Mr Trump taking a call from the Taiwanese president, who congratulated him on his election victory. It earned a rebuke from Beijing. In Sunday's interview, Mr Trump remained defiant. \"It was a call, very short call, saying'congratulations, sir, on the victory'.... and why should some other nation be able to say I can't take a call?\" Taiwan: A pawn in Trump's chess game The Trump phone call that will stun Beijing Trump rejects CIA Russia hacking report Rewind to 1949 and the Communist takeover in China. Kuomintang nationalists fled to Taiwan and set up their own government. Since then, China has seen it as a renegade province, sometimes going so far as to threaten the use force if it ever declares independence. After decades of formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, the US decided in 1979 it was in its best interests to recognise the Communist government in Beijing as the sole legal government of China. This was the result of years of warming ties between Washington and Beijing, starting with President Richard Nixon's celebrated visit in 1972. Formal ties with Taiwan were cut, but strong informal links remain, including substantial military support. So the \"One China\" policy is Washington recognising that there is only one China, and Taiwan is part of it. It is seen by many as ambiguous, but any suggestion that this could be changing raises hackles in Beijing. Read more on the'One China' policy? The strength of China's displeasure depends on who you listen to. Here's that Chinese foreign ministry spokesman again: \"China has noted the report and expresses serious concern about it. I want to stress that the Taiwan issue concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and involves China's core interests. \"Upholding the'One China' principle is the political basis for developing China-US ties. If this basis is interfered with, or damaged, then the healthy development of China-US relations and bilateral co-operation in important areas is out of the question.\" But the Global Times, which is linked to the ruling Communist Party, is somewhat firmer. It suggests China may have to consider arming America's enemies or taking back Taiwan by force. The \"One China policy cannot be traded,\" it warns. \"China must resolutely battle Mr Trump, only after a few serious rebuffs then will he truly understand that China and other global powers cannot be bullied.\" He may be a businessman, it went on, \"but in the field of diplomacy, he is as ignorant as a child.\" China already formally protested to the US on 3 December over that phone call from Taiwan's president. By way of contrast, on 7 December, China hailed Mr Trump's nominee for US ambassador in Beijing, Terry Branstad, as an \"old friend\" of China who could help advance relations. Well it's not as if Donald Trump didn't tell us he was going to be tough on China. Now, though, we are getting what looks like the outline of a strategy: the use of Taiwan as a bargaining chip. It's a bold - some would say reckless - gambit, given that for China there is nothing vaguely negotiable about the island's status. Mr Trump's team includes so-called \"long-time friends of Taiwan\" or China hawks who clearly understand the value of the island, at least as a bargaining tool in dealings with Beijing. Some in Taiwan's administration feel his tough approach toward Beijing could enable Taiwan to build closer ties with Washington, its most important ally. But many Taiwanese people are unsure if this approach will be good for Taiwan and question whether Mr Trump will truly stand up for Taiwan if conflict breaks out with China.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device Ding scored at least a half-century in every frame he won as he extended his first-session lead from 6-2 to 10-2. Williams, who had to play with a new tip after splitting his old one on Monday, managed to pot just two balls before the mid-session interval. The Welshman did take frame 13, but China's Ding powered to victory. Two-time Crucible champion Williams only made two half-centuries, but said he was destined to lose from the moment he split his old tip. \"I got beat easily and, to be honest, deep down I knew I would so I cannot really grumble,\" said Williams, 41. \"I was playing, and feeling, brilliant. With the players left in, it was probably my best chance of winning the World Championship. \"But as soon as my tip split the night before I knew then that my chances were gone. It was almost impossible. It didn't matter who I played. \"He played good but in the first session, I feel, if I had my normal tip I would have been in front.\" Ding still had to take his opportunities and he did so in devastating style. Williams was so accustomed to sitting in his chair during a one-sided start to the evening session, that Ding had to remind his opponent to get up and go in for a break. The Welshman then joked that he had Ding \"rattled\" and his \"head had gone\" when he tweeted during the interlude. Ding, who last reached the semi-finals in 2011, has dropped down to 17 in the world and had to qualify for this year's tournament. But the 29-year-old looked to be reaping the reward of so much time in play during a one-sided morning session where he was sharp and fluent in taking six from seven frames after Williams won the opener. And he sealed victory with little fuss, grabbing his 11th score of more than 50 on his way. \"I got some easy chances in the match because Mark had a lot of bad kicks,\" Ding said. \"And every player has a big problem if they have a new tip. \"I controlled the game, took my chances and made some good breaks. I was confident. Every time I saw a chance I thought I could go for it and pot it.\" In the evening's other match, world number one Mark Selby maintained his four-frame advantage over gutsy qualifier Kyren Wilson to lead 10-6 with a session to play. Wilson, who beat top-10 seeds Joe Perry and Mark Allen to reach the last eight, had chances in the first three frames but lost them all as the 2014 champion Selby built a 6-0 lead. The Kettering man responded by taking the next two and then won a scrappy ninth frame of a disjointed match to get to within three. But Selby's famed matchplay saw him keep his rival at bay and he won a tense final frame to avoid his lead being reduced to two frames. Wilson and Selby return to finish their match on Wednesday morning.",

        "The body of Lindsay Rimer, 13, was found in the Rochdale Canal five months after she disappeared in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, in November 1994. Her killer has never been found and West Yorkshire Police are treating the death as murder. The force said a new DNA profile had been identified, which it hoped would lead them to identify the killer. Speaking on the anniversary of the discovery of her body, Det Supt Simon Atkinson said: \"Our Canadian colleagues are doing some ground-breaking forensic work, so we've sent some of the forensic exhibits over to them. \"They have been able to develop a DNA profile which we are really interested in developing further.\" He added: \"It's a leap forward we haven't had in the past 21 years, so I'm really excited about this development.\" Lindsay left her home in Cambridge Street at about 22:00 and visited the Trades Club in Home Street. The last known sighting of her was caught on CCTV 20 minutes later as she bought cornflakes at a shop in Crown Street. Her body, which had been weighted down with a stone, was recovered about a mile upstream from the town centre. Juliet Rimer, her younger sister, said: \"A piece of everyone's soul is missing and I often wonder how our lives would have been, if we were not a broken family. \"The advice Lindsay would have given me, the fights we might have had, and the things we may have shared. \"Getting the answers wouldn't change the hurt, but it would help bring closure to us all.\"",
        "The FTSE has fallen 5.2, or 363 points, since Monday. On Friday the index closed 2.8 lower, while markets in Paris and Frankfurt saw falls of about 3. Shares also plunged on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and SP 500 indexes all down more than 3 by the close. Only one company on the FTSE 100 saw gains on Friday - Royal Mail, which rose by 1.6. The FTSE 100 has fallen for nine sessions in a row, its longest losing streak since 2011. It is almost 13 below an all-time high hit in April. In the US, the SP 500 suffered its biggest daily percentage drop in nearly four years on Friday, losing 64.8 points, or 3.19, to 1,970.89. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.12, and the Nasdaq dropped 3.52. As well as global stock markets, US oil prices also dived on Friday, with New York crude dipping below 40 a barrel for the first time since the financial crisis and marking its longest weekly losing streak since 1986. Earlier, data from China indicated factory output in August shrank at its fastest pace in more than six years. The private CaixinMarkit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 47.1 from 47.8 in July. A figure below 50 indicates contraction. The data triggered another sell-off in Chinese shares, which ended the day down more than 4. The decline comes on the heels of weaker-than-expected economic data in July, plus this month's yuan devaluation and a stock market plunge. Investors are growing increasingly concerned, as the Shanghai Composite index is now down 12 this week. Friday's factory output reading for China was the lowest since March 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis, and the sixth consecutive below the 50-point level. The Caixin flash PMI is the earliest economic measure of the Chinese economy to be released each month and is closely watched for clues on how growth is faring. Earlier in August, China's official economic growth data showed a further slowdown in the past quarter, expanding 7 compared with a year earlier, its slowest pace since 2009. In 2014, China's economy grew at its slowest pace since 1990. It expanded by 7.4, missing its annual growth target of 7.5 for the first time in 15 years. Since June this year, stock exchanges on the mainland have seen extreme volatility, undermining investor confidence and leading to government intervention. Nicholas Teo, market analyst with CMC markets, warned that China's slumping economy could dash hopes for a global recovery. \"China today is no longer just the'factory' of the world. It is an important consumer of the world's products and services. Many companies and industries depend on the Chinese consumers who are now'disadvantaged' in purchasing power,\" he said. \"So when it sneezes', many around the globe may just catch a cold.\" Greater China economist Julia Wang at HSBC warned that economic recovery continued to lose momentum with \"further policy-easing measures, from monetary easing to fiscal support needed.\" But other analysts warned against overreacting to the current situation. AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver described the situation as a \"global share market correction,\" pointing out that emerging markets were \"arguably much stronger than in 1997-98, with stronger current account balances and higher foreign exchange reserves.\" Beijing has struggled to stabilise the country's stock markets, which have fallen sharply since mid-June. Earlier this month, the central bank stunned global markets by taking steps to devalue the country's currency, the yuan, allowing it more freedom to fluctuate in line with market developments. The move was widely seen as an attempt to prop up the country's ailing export sector, making Chinese goods cheaper abroad.",
        "And if they were all forced to pick just one with which to tell the story of the Obama presidency, many would plump for the bar chart of \"non-farm payrolls.\" The non-farm payrolls report is simply the official measure of how many jobs the US economy has added (or lost) in the previous month. The release of this job tally, which happens at the same time, on the same day (the first Friday) of every single month, is one of the constants in the working life of a Wall Street economist or reporter. Many feel they measure out their lives with non-farm payroll reports. But you can reasonably measure out the Obama presidency with them as well. Take a look at the chart. On it you can see that from the first such report after entering the White House, President Obama learned that the US economy had just shed 800,000 jobs in one month. No other figure so clearly illustrates that Mr Obama started his presidency with an economy that wasn't just weak, it was on the verge of collapse. A recession of a severity not seen since the 1930s was under way. The most pressing question for the new president was what, if anything, could be done to stabilise the economy so that it could create jobs once more. The chart shows us what happened. By early 2010 the monthly tally shows the US was adding jobs again And albeit with further dips later that year, it has done so ever since. The last non-farm payrolls report of the Obama era showed that in December 2016 the US economy added 156,000 jobs. It was also the 75th consecutive month of job growth. There has never been such a long period of job creation. The official unemployment rate in the US is now 4.7. For many economists that represents \"full employment.\" But the chart doesn't tell us WHY the job market bottomed out and started its long expansion. For an explanation of that you might start with one word: Detroit Detroit, or rather the US car industry with which the city is synonymous, was seemingly in its death throes in January 2009. The recession and financial crisis had hit General Motors, Chrysler and Ford particularly hard. Already heavily indebted, by the turn of the Obama administration it looked like they would simply run out of cash and cease operations within weeks. President Obama's decision to bail out General Motors and Chrysler with bridging loans and managed bankruptcies (Ford managed to turn itself around without government money) was deeply controversial. But look again at the chart. If the auto industry had in fact collapsed, we would probably need to spread something like a million more job losses across those bars for 2009-10. Beyond the number of jobs directly or indirectly lost, it's hard to calculate the ultimate economic effects of a disintegration of the US auto industry. But it seems safe to say that America would look very different indeed without the auto bailout. There was also Mr Obama's stimulus package - or the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, to give it its official name. This was a package of government spending which Congress passed, at the new president's behest, within weeks of his taking office. It too met fierce criticism and its impact has long been disputed. Still, more than one analysis has estimated that through 2010 it created or saved more than 2 million jobs. Taking those away would also dramatically alter the non-farm payrolls chart. At least it would for the beginning of Mr Obama's presidency. But after the first two years of his administration the politics of job creation, like everything else, changed. The Republican Party's capture of the House of Representatives in November 2010 deprived the president of most of his influence on the writing of new laws. He lost his grasp of one of the main levers of economic control and never regained it. That means that so much of the long period of job growth, from 2011 to the present, has unfolded with little input from the White House. Of course the president always has large powers, whoever controls Congress, but they tend to be in the administration of business regulations and in trade relations. Attributing the creation of jobs to those functions of government is even more speculative than attributing them to new laws. Still, if presidents cannot write laws, their veto power means laws can hardly ever be passed without them. It is a feature of the notorious political \"gridlock\" that has characterised much of the Obama era. The president and the Republican Congress have been in a perpetual stand-off over so many issues at the heart of the economy. The result is that many economic problems have gone unaddressed. Yet it also means that politicians, and their insistence on change and reform, have been kept on the sidelines, leaving the economy to develop without them. In the absence of major external shocks, perhaps the consistent job growth the US has enjoyed for more than six years should be attributed, not to the name and the politics of the president but to things more fundamental to the US and its brand of capitalism. It seems appropriate that after the steep steps down, then up, in the first 18 months of the non-farm payrolls bar chart, what the Obama presidency looks like is then a consistent series of bars, representing steady if undramatic job growth, month after month after month.",
        "TV coverage showed hundreds of empty seats at Leicester City's third-round replay against Spurs, with many home fans missing the start of the game. One supporter claimed the delays at the King Power Stadium, caused by ticketing problems, could have \"turned nasty.\" Leicester City FC has apologised and launched an investigation. Live updates and more from Leicestershire Joe Walker, a Foxes fan, said he arrived at the ground at about 19:25 GMT and saw \"thousands of people attempting to gain access.\" He said after 20 minutes in the queue his \"print at home\" ticket was rejected at the turnstile and he was told to go to the ticket office to get a new one. \"We then walked towards the sub ticket office and as I questioned another steward he just laughed and said:'You should see the queues for it'.\" Mr Walker eventually had a ticket printed at the main office, but described the way staff managed the situation as \"a shambles.\" \"Not one announcement had been made over the loudspeaker system,\" he said. \"There was no organization or information coming from any of the stewards. It could have easily have turned quite nasty with the sheer amount of people.\" Leicester City FC said: \"A significant number of supporters experienced difficulty gaining admission to the stadium, resulting in many missing the start of the match. \"The club is currently investigating the cause of Wednesday night's delays as a priority, to ensure any difficulties experienced are not repeated at future home matches.\" Leicester lost Wednesday night's match 0-2.",
        "The Conservative minister said he was inviting other political parties for talks on securing \"the best possible devolution settlement for Wales.\" A new UK cabinet committee chaired by Commons Leader William Hague will now meet for the first time on Wednesday. Mr Crabb's comments come as Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones called for a convention on future of the UK. Speaking on Tuesday at the Labour Party conference, Mr Jones said the union cannot be rebuilt through conversation between only Westminster and Scotland. Now the Welsh secretary has pledged to keep Wales at the discussion table on the future of devolved powers across Britain. Mr Crabb said he had already held preliminary discussions with Mr Hague, a former Welsh secretary himself. \"We are both in absolute agreement that Wales should be central to the debate that is now commencing,\" said Mr Crabb. \"I want us to use this opportunity positively to look again at how we secure the best possible devolution settlement for Wales. \"I want to move forward in a realistic, open-minded and pragmatic way.\" Mr Crabb has written to the leaders of other Welsh parties at Westminster inviting them to a Wales Office \"summit\" to discuss \"how we deliver devolution that works for Wales.\" The meeting is likely to take place when parliament returns next month. He said he is also arranging meetings with party leaders in the National Assembly to ensure their views feed into the debate. The comments from Mr Crabb came as Prime Minister David Cameron hosted discussions with backbench Tory MPs at his Chequers country residence. One of the two Welsh MPs to attend was the Aberconway MP, Guto Bebb. He said events in Scotland have \"completely changed the nature of the debate\" on devolution. Key to Monday's talks have been the issue of \"English votes for English laws,\" which would see Welsh and Scottish MPs excluded from voting on devolved matters in the House of Commons. That has led to Labour Party leader Ed Miliband accusing Mr Cameron of planning to set the UK nations against each other. But the Aberconway MP said he took a different view. \"The promises made to Scotland must be delivered upon and if they are delivered on then we are going to end up in my view with English votes for English laws and that in my view is a simple matter of fairness,\" said Mr Bebb.",

The donation was accepted on Tuesday by Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, who is campaigning for a new historical centre to house Collins' collection. \"Texans are deeply indebted to Phil Collins,\" Patterson said. \"He is giving us back our heritage. \"Now these Texas treasures need a home where all can see them and study from them and learn about how Texans won our liberty.\" The legendary battle, named after a former mission in San Antonio, saw 1,500 Mexican troops lay siege to 200 Texans fighting for Texas independence. Collins said he first became interested in the Alamo after watching a 1950s TV series about Crockett, the famed frontiersman who died in the conflict.

        "Russell Goodway told BBC Radio Wales that councillors and officials were the \"experts\" and should \"seriously develop\" a set of proposals. Former Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews had been planning to cut the 22 councils to eight or nine. But First Minister Carwyn Jones has said the Welsh Government will have to rethink its plans to win wider support. Mr Andrews is no longer in government after losing his Rhondda seat at the election in May, and the Labour manifesto did not include a commitment on the number of councils it would like to see. As a minority government, Labour will need the support of other parties if any cut is to happen. Speaking on the Good Morning Wales programme on Monday, Mr Goodway said: \"The status quo isn't an option. \"You really cannot maintain 22 local authorities unless you're prepared to dismantle local government as we know it and create other organisations or bodies that would be responsible for some of the major services such as education, social services and possibly economic development. \"I would like to see the experts in the field, who happen to be those that run local authorities - whether they're councillors or council officials - coming forward with well-developed proposals to meet the government's aims. \"I do not want to see a top-down reorganisation imposed on Welsh local government, particularly at a time when you're seeing a lot of new faces in the assembly, people who don't have the expertise in local government to shape those services. \"I really do hope now the Welsh Local Government Association and the leaders in local government will come forward and seriously develop a set of proposals, hopefully capturing the city region dimension.\" On Sunday, the first minister told BBC Radio Wales he wanted to talk to opposition parties about the future of local government. \"Clearly, the map we published before the election, that is not going to gain support across the assembly, that's obvious,\" Mr Jones told the Sunday Supplement programme. Meanwhile trade unions representing council workers have asked for urgent talks on the issue with the new finance and local government secretary Mark Drakeford. Dominic MacAskill, head of local government in Wales for Unison, said: \"We are in a state of limbo and, in that state of limbo, the workforce is anxious and fearful of the future.\"",
        "Six suicide attackers and an Afghan security guard were killed. At least 17 civilians were injured. A minibus was detonated but another bomb-laden car defused, police said. The Taliban, who have launched several high-profile raids on Kabul, said they were behind the attack. The BBC's Bilal Sarwary in Kabul says the attacked area is often packed with civilians who come to collect passports and national identity cards at the interior ministry. Intelligence chief Gen Zaher Zaher told the BBC the clearance operation was now over. The area affected in central Kabul is heavily barricaded - and the NDS compound, which also houses several Western embassies, is surrounded by tall, thick cement walls designed to protect it from bomb blasts. A senior Afghan security official told the BBC that the attackers targeted the NDS unit where suicide attackers and key Taliban commanders are interrogated. The NDS said that one suicide attacker drove a minibus which exploded outside the NDS building. Five others, armed with semi-automatic weapons and hand grenades, then fought the security forces for 15 minutes before being killed by guards. According to the NDS, another vehicle packed with explosives was defused shortly afterwards. The main explosion took place around noon local time (07:30 GMT). A plume of smoke rose from the area, and gunfire and police sirens were then heard. One eyewitness, Mohammad Zia, told Associated Press that the vehicle with the bomb inside drove up to the gates of the barricaded NDS building and then was detonated. A number of wrecked cars could be seen. Shop owner Qais Ahmad told Reuters: \"I was inside the shop when I heard noises and a huge bang. All the windows in my shop were destroyed and injured my head.\" The attack comes shortly after the return from the US of President Hamid Karzai, who was discussing the future of his country after the Nato-led troops withdraw at the end of next year with President Barack Obama. Wednesday's attack on the embassy area of Kabul is the first since November, when a suicide bomber killed two Afghan security guards and wounded three. Last month, NDS chief Asadullah Khalid was wounded in a Taliban suicide bombing in the Taymeni area of central Kabul. The Taliban said the attacker had posed as a peace messenger. Mr Khalid has been in the job since September and has a reputation for being fiercely anti-Taliban. Militant groups continue to mount regular attacks in Afghanistan, raising questions as to how the Afghan security forces will cope after 2014.",
        "The price fell below 4.8 euros in early trading, before recovering to above 5 euros by late afternoon. Carbon permits are a mechanism designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, as companies have to pay to emit C02. A sharp drop in demand for energy has led to a massive oversupply of permits. Critics of the EU's Emissions Trading System also argue that the European Union issued too many permits in the first place. The EU has proposed freezing up to 900 million permits to tackle this oversupply. \"There are too many permits because of the recession,\" said Isaac Valero, spokesman for EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard. The price of carbon recovered slightly on Monday after demand for an auction of 3.5 million permits was stronger than expected. A weak carbon price undermines efforts to reduce C02 emissions. The price of carbon needs to be a good deal higher than 5 euros - some believe between 25 and 30 euros - to provide an adequate incentive for companies to cut emissions and invest in cleaner technologies, experts say. The carbon market is central to Europe's efforts to meet its climate change target of a 20 reduction in C02 emissions from 1990 levels by 2020.",
        "The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the body which oversees the rules of the game, passed the law at a meeting in Zurich. It will come in to force on 1 June, in time for the World Cup in Brazil. The new law was proposed by the Football Association and will apply to domestic and international football. FA general secretary Alex Horne said: \"The idea is to get some consistency. The simplest rule for the image of the game is to start from the basis that slogans will not be allowed.\" From the time the new rule comes in to place, incidents such as Mario Balotelli's infamous \"Why Always Me?\" message, which he revealed after scoring against Manchester United in 2011, will be banned and subject to a sanction. Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke said: \"It is definitely decided that players must not have any slogan or statement, and we are making the decision that it will apply to the World Cup.\" Law 4 of the game, which relates to players' equipment, will be amended. It states: \"Players must not reveal undergarments that show political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturer logo. \"A playerteam of a player that reveals an undergarment that shows political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturers' logo will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by Fifa.\" Meanwhile, the IFAB rejected a proposal from Uefa to amend the so-called \"triple punishment\" which occurs when a penalty kick is given within a game, warranting a player being sent off and a possible goal being scored. It was agreed that a pilot project carried out by the FA and Scottish Football Association relating to revolving substitutes in amateur football will continue, as will a Uefa experiment into the use of a sin bin in recreational football. The IFAB also discussed the potential use of video replays for match officials but remains of the view that technology should be allowed only for goal-line incidents because \"it is a clear yes or no decision.\" An IFAB statement read: \"Concerns were raised about video replays slowing the game down and increasing the number of stoppages.\"",
        "The Project Loon team, part of the company's X research lab, said it was now able to use machine learning to predict weather systems. It means the firm has far greater control over where its balloons go, making it possible to focus on a specific region, rather than circumnavigating the globe. Clustering a small number of balloons greatly reduces the cost of the idea, Google's \"captain of moonshots,\" Astro Teller, told reporters. \"We can now run an experiment and try to give service in a particular place in the world with ten, twenty or thirty balloons,\" he said, rather than the hundreds needed previously. \"Real users\" will be able to use the system in the \"coming months,\" he added - but he did not specify where the initial roll out would take place. Rural ambition Google's aim is to provide connectivity to the around four billion people in the world who do not have access to the internet, particularly those in difficult-to-reach rural areas. Rather than undertake huge construction projects to replicate connectivity networks in the developed world, the firm has instead experimented with beaming down connectivity from a network of huge, tennis-court sized balloons. The balloons float in the stratosphere around 11 miles high. By raising or lowering altitude, the balloons can be caught in different weather streams, changing direction. By using machine-learning algorithms, Google thinks it has cracked a way to predict weather with enough accuracy to make it possible to hover balloons over a relatively small area for a long period of time. Last last year the firm was able to keep a cluster of balloons over Peru for three months. Spin off Over the past year Google has come under increasing pressure from its shareholders to rein in the costs of its more outlandish ideas. Last month, the firm has spun off its self-driving project into a new company - Waymo - and has stepped up attempts to commercialise the technology amid criticism it was taking too long to make money from its work. Mr Teller said Project Loon was one of the more \"mature\" moonshot ideas at the company, but while it was entering into contracts with telecoms firms, Google was in \"no rush\" to make Project Loon a stand-alone business. \"The service has a much better chance of being profitable which is obviously exciting for us,\" he said. \"Things have gone much better than we anticipated they could go. That has made the prospects of Loon even better than we had anticipated.\" Falling out of the sky One key hurdle for the company to overcome is the reliability of its balloons. To date, the record for continuous balloon flight has been 190 days. At a research lab within Google's campus in Mountain View, California, development teams painstakingly analyse each failed balloons on a huge scanner nicknamed \"Billie Jean\" owning to light panels reminiscent of the illuminating pavement in Michael Jackson's iconic music video. Other technologies trying to achieve similar goals have been tested by Google and others. The company recently shut down Project Titan, an effort to use solar-powered drones to deliver connectivity to a wide area. The programme was cancelled owing to economic and technology difficulties, the company said. Facebook has attempted to work with similar technology. It's Project Aquila drone, which is being developed in the UK, suffered a major setback when one of its craft crashed last June. On the challenge facing Project Loon, Mr Teller admitted that many at the company did not think it would ever actually work. \"If we'd known how hard it was going to be, we probably never would have tried,\" he wrote in a blog post published on Thursday.

        "Rows between rival electoral commissioners had led to physical fights, Jecha Salum Jecha said. The opposition says the vote on the islands was cancelled because it won. The main challenger in the national presidential election, Edward Lowassa, said the problems in Zanzibar could be mirrored across the country. Earlier, he called for the national electoral commission to stop releasing results, alleging the whole process nationwide had been marred by fraud. The elections in Tanzania are the most competitive in the country's history, with four opposition parties forming the Ukawa coalition to challenge the ruling CCM's 54-year grip on power. Previous elections have turned violent on semi-autonomous Zanzibar, whose two main islands are Unguja, often referred to as Zanzibar, and Pemba. Mr Lowassa urged his supporters to remain calm and not to engage in street protests. In his statement, Mr Jecha accused Zanzibari electoral commissioners of being partisan. More votes had been cast in some areas than the registered number of voters, especially in Pemba, where some party agents had been ejected from polling stations, Mr Jecha said. The ballot papers for the national presidential election have been taken to Tanzania's main city Dar es Salaam, where they will continue to be counted. It is unclear if and when new elections for Zanzibar's president and parliament will be held. Analysis: Sammy Awami, BBC News, Zanzibar: Never before has an election in Zanzibar - a popular tourist destination - been scrapped. So we are entering uncharted waters. And yet, this election - unlike previous ones - has not been marred by riots and violence. There was, however, some tension, which led to the closure of roads and businesses. On Monday, the main opposition candidate for the post of Zanzibar president, Maalim Seif Sharrif Hamad, declared himself the winner. His announcement attracted sharp rebuke from the governing CCM party, which called it illegal and a threat to the archipelago's stability. But life was returning to normal when the archipelago's electoral commission chairman made the shock announcement that he was scrapping the poll because it was full of gross irregularities. At that point results from 36 of the 54 constituencies had been released. More on Zanzibar Tanzania's tightly contested election: Could CCM lose? Money, power and politics",

        "Hughie Maughan's teak tone under the spotlight had viewers doing their own keyboard tap dance. The Dublin man was appearing on Irish broadcaster RTE's Dancing With The Stars at the weekend. Hughie told RTE's Ryan Tubridy he had laughed off the comments, claiming he had \"thick elephant skin.\" \"The entire place was staring at me and the whole studio was looking at me, laughing and were gobsmacked,\" he added. \"I just found it funny. I'm one of those types of people, I'm bonkers when it comes to certain things. \"It's made people speak about me which is probably a good thing, I am on a TV show... Isn't that the point of television?\" Hughie's boyfriend Ryan Ruckledge was among those who contributed to the comments sparked by his partner's polished visage. \"He really shouldn't have taken tanning tips from me,\" he joked, before adding, \"bad boyfriend advice hahah sorry.\" The pair met on Channel 5's Big Brother programme last year. Others compared Hughie to Ross Geller from the hit US TV show Friends when David Schwimmer's sitcom character has a spray tan fiasco. Host Nicky Byrne said: \"Hughie, you are trending on Twitter - we don't know why.\"",
        "Matthew Gillard, of Connsbrook Avenue in east Belfast, pleaded not guilty to charges including kidnapping and false imprisonment. The defendant, 25, also denied charges of common assault, assaulting a police officer and driving dangerously. The charges relate to incidents in east Belfast and Comber on Saturday 4 April. Newtownards Magistrates Court heard that the defendant and the woman were in his car in east Belfast when he began questioning her about who she was seeing. A detective giving evidence in court said the woman tried to get out of the Seat Toledo car but the defendant allegedly drove off at speed, through a red light on Bloomfield Avenue. When the car stopped on the Belfast Road in Comber, the woman escaped along a lane but was carried back to the car by the defendant, the court heard. An off-duty police sergeant saw this and went to help the woman. When the sergeant tried to intervene, the defendant allegedly drove his car at the officer, forcing him to get out of the way. The sergeant was able to pull the keys from the ignition through the car's open window, but the defendant wrenched them from his grasp. He then drove to the Grand Parade area of east Belfast where the woman was released. He is also alleged to have sent the woman a message threatening that if she went to police about the incident he would \"ruin her life in every possible way.\" The court heard that the defendant handed himself over to police on Wednesday, despite being aware since Saturday that he was wanted by the PSNI. But during police interviews he refused to answer questions put to him. An application for bail was made but this was refused. Mr Gillard will appear again in court on 1 May.",
        "The Times reports that doctors in Kiev used a method called pronuclear transfer in what is a world first. It is not the first baby born with DNA from three parents, however. The baby girl, born on 5 January, is thought to be the world's second \"modern three-parent baby\" - another child was created using a slightly different method in Mexico last year. The Kiev team fertilised the mother's egg with her partner's sperm. They then transferred the combined genes into an egg taken from a donor. The child has the genetic identity of the parents, alongside a tiny amount of DNA from the second woman. Doctors developed three-person IVF to help women who are at risk of passing on serious genetic disorders, called mitochondrial disease, to have a healthy child. Eggs from a mother with unhealthy mitochondria and a donor with healthy mitochondria are collected. The Nadiya clinic in Kiev used the technique to treat an infertile couple, not a couple carrying a mitochondrial disease. UK experts said this was \"highly experimental.\" Valery Zukin, who led the work, said they had a hunch it would work for the Ukrainian couple who had not been able to conceive with conventional IVF. He said he had a second patient - in a similar situation - who is expected to give birth in early March. The UK has already passed laws to allow three-person IVF for couples with mitochondrial diseases, although no such baby has been born in Britain yet. The science is new and controversial and raises ethical questions, including how any child from the technique might feel about having DNA from three people. Prof Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: \"Pronuclear transfer is highly experimental and has not been properly evaluated or scientifically proven. \"We would be extremely cautious about adopting this approach to improve IVF outcomes.\"",
        "Pakistan's 42-year-old Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq and 40-year-old batsman Younis Khan complete the list. India captain Virat Kohli, 28, was named leading cricketer in the world, while Australia's Ellyse Perry, 26, was the world's leading women's cricketer. The coveted awards, which began in 1889, are a central feature of the annual Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Its editor said 2016 was the year Woakes, 28, \"announced himself as an international-class all-rounder.\" They praised the 26 wickets the Warwickshire player took over last summer's four Tests against Pakistan, and the unbeaten 95 he scored in a one-day international against Sri Lanka at Trent Bridge in June. Northamptonshire batsman Duckett, 22, was singled out for his \"remarkable\" run total of 2,706 across all formats of the game last year. \"As much as anyone, he epitomised English cricket's new breed of 360-degree batsmanship,\" it was added. Roland-Jones, 29, who was called up to England's Test squad for the first time in July, picked up a hat-trick for Middlesex as they secured a first County Championship title in 23 years in September. Wisden editor Lawrence Booth described the feat as \"the highlight of the domestic summer.\" Younis' \"classy\" 218 in Pakistan's final Test against England at The Oval was \"a reminder that his struggles earlier in the series had been a blip rather than part of a decline,\" Booth wrote. Misbah's celebratory press-ups after an unbeaten century in the first Test at Lord's were described as \"one of the motifs of the year.\" Australia all-rounder Perry \"seemed to be operating on another level\" over a year in which she averaged 81 with the bat in one-day internationals, taking her record between 2014 and 2016 to 17 half-centuries in 23 innings. And India captain Kohli's double ton in Mumbai confirmed him as \"the spiritual successor to Sachin Tendulkar.\"",
        "Former Carrick boss Haveron was appointed Glens supremo this week and could not have asked for a more high-profile first match in charge. Glentoran have slumped to 10th in the table after taking just one point from a possible 15. \"We must show how much it means to play in games like these,\" said Haveron. \"Our fans expect the players to show passion and pride and that is how it should be. \"We have got to get a bit belief and a win would do that. \"The best way to turn our season around would be to beat Linfield on Saturday.\" Despite being at home, Glentoran will be firm underdogs against David Healy's Linfield who are unbeaten this season. The Belfast Blues sit in second place and are five points behind champions Crusaders with a match in hand. The unbeaten Crues also face a big derby fixture as they host north Belfast neighbours Cliftonville at Seaview. Crusaders have won five league matches in a row while Cliftonville are up to fourth following back-to-back victories. \"Cliftonville are back in form and are winning games of football quite well,\" said Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter. \"They are packed full of quality players and have loads of confidence and ability. They will expect to get a result.\" Ballymena United travel to their fiercest rivals Coleraine looking to make it four wins in a row in the league. They came from behind to beat Glentoran 4-1 last weekend to consolidate third place in the table. \"It will be my first experience of a ColeraineBallymena derby and we're looking forward to it,\" said Sky Blues boss David Jeffrey. \"They came from two down to draw against Glenavon last week so that is an indication of the character they possess.\" The fourth derby clash in Saturday's Premiership is at Mourneview Park where Glenavon host Portadown.

        "Kat Merchant and Emily Scarratt scored early tries for England before Rawina Everitt crossed for New Zealand. Further tries from Merchant and Roz Crowley put England 24-10 up before Selica Winiata crossed on half-time. Jo Watmore added a fifth try and Scarratt's boot did the rest, Kendra Cocksedge's late try mere consolation. 23 Nov: England 16-13 New Zealand 27 Nov: England 17-8 New Zealand 1 Dec: England 32-23 New Zealand England head coach Gary Street said: \"Obviously we're hugely delighted to have won here at Twickenham and to wrap up the series in front of a big home crowd. The players, as a group, were once again outstanding and they showed tremendous mental strength to get through this series and win it 3-0. \"There is a lot of trust in this group and that shows every time a squad member pulls on the England shirt. We may not have won a World Cup for many years but we are definitely the number one side in the world at the moment.\" England produced some superb flowing rugby at Twickenham, with the backs profiting from the good work of the forwards to run New Zealand ragged on occasions. The Black Ferns had the edge in the maul but they could not cope with England's pacy all-round game. New Zealand showed attacking intent from the off but after early pressure England broke out from their own 22 as Natasha Hunt took a quick tap penalty. Watmore made good ground, producing a couple of trademark hand-offs, and Merchant supported well to scorch over in the corner. Three minutes later Scarratt latched onto Katy McLean's neat chip and full-back Scarratt converted her own try to make it 12-0. 2010: New Zealand 13-10 England 2006: New Zealand 25-17 England 2002: New Zealand 19-9 England New Zealand hit back as Everitt crossed for a converted try but the hosts were soon back on the front foot, with Merchant beating three tacklers and taking another one over the line with her for an unconverted try. Kelly Brazier landed a penalty for New Zealand as the scoreboard continued to kick over but England had the upper hand and they added a fourth try, converted by Scarratt, as prop Crowley finished off another fine attack. New Zealand are not world champions for nothing though and, with England down to 14 after Heather Fisher was sin-binned, Winiata scored in the corner to make it 24-15 at half-time. The visitors cut the gap to six points soon after the restart as Brazier squeezed over a penalty, but that was as close as they would get. The Black Ferns lost Aroha Savage to the sin-bin and Watmore made them pay with a fine try after an arcing outside break, and Scarratt soon added a penalty to give England a 32-18 lead. Cocksedge cut the gap for the world champions but England ended the game on top and looked the more likely scorers at the final whistle.

        "The Reverend Gavin Ashenden, a senior clergyman in the Church of England, left his position as chaplain in order to be free to criticise the move. A passage from the Koran was read during an Epiphany service at St Mary's Cathedral in Glasgow earlier this month. Mr Ashenden said the reading had caused \"serious offence.\" The cathedral has said it is standing by its decision. St Mary's invited local Muslims, who also revere Jesus as a prophet, to join the service. A student, Madinah Javed, read from the lectern in Arabic from the chapter of Maryam, or Mary. The chapter tells the story of the birth of Christ to the virgin Mary, and includes the Islamic teaching that Jesus is not the son of God and should not be worshipped. Mr Ashenden told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme: \"The problem with what happened in Glasgow was that, although it was presented as a way of building bridges and a way of educating people, it was done badly, in the wrong way, in the wrong place, in the wrong context. \"There are a number of members of the congregation who have written open letters complaining of the profound upset they experienced as people who are part of the Eucharistic community who had come to worship Christ.\" The cathedral's provost, the Very Rev Kelvin Holdsworth, has said readings of the Koran in the cathedral were part of efforts to build relationships between Christians and Muslims in Glasgow. He said: \"Such readings have happened a number of times in the past in this and in other churches and have led to deepening friendships locally, to greater awareness of the things we hold in common and to dialogue about the ways in which we differ.\" Asked if he had known what the Koran verse specifically said about Jesus, Mr Holdsworth declined to comment further.",

        "The Tayside outfit lost both their games on their maiden outing at the showpiece finals in Nottingham over the weekend. But the Stars showed up well in the 4-2 semi-final defeat to Cardiff Devils and the 15-8 third-place match loss to Belfast Giants. \"It's been a great experience for our guys and hopefully next year we can come back here and learn from it, like Cardiff did,\" LeFebvre said. \"I had some time to reflect on Saturday's performance against Cardiff and I'm so proud of my players. It was a dream start for us to go 2-0 up in the first period. \"It was always going to be a tough task keeping that pace up all game against a team like the Devils, who are rightfully league champions. \"But to be the first team from Dundee to make it to this weekend, it's not to be sniffed at and I'm proud of that.\" Dundee could hold their heads high after a great performance against the Devils in Saturday's semi-final, even if it was to end in a 4-2 defeat. Vinny Scarsella teed up Kevin Hart on the blue line and he fired his effort past Devils goalie Ben Bowns to open the scoring. Stars then went two up as Brett Switzer's low diagonal shot beat Bowns at his bottom right hard corner. The Devils started to claw their way back into the game six minutes into the second period as Joey Haddad found space in front of Dundee's goal to finish. The EIHL champions pulled level when Mark Louis reacted quickest to tuck in an equaliser. Devils completed the comeback with nine minutes left as Joey Martin put them 3-2 ahead before Andrew Hotham confirmed their place in Sunday's final with a late empty-net goal. It meant an early start on Sunday for the Stars who had to face fellow beaten semi-finalists Belfast Giants, who had gone down 2-0 to eventual play-off winners Sheffield Steelers. The sides shared 23 goals with Justin Faryna netting two for Dundee, while Kevin Bruijsten, Joey Sides, Mikael Lidhammar, Matt White, Vinny Scarsella and Craig Moore were also on target for Stars. LeFebvre added: \"The third place game was a lot of fun I guess, but overall, we enjoyed the experience of being involved in this weekend. \"Both us and Belfast knew what we were in for in that game on Sunday and the pace of play there would be. It picked up a little bit in the latter stages. \"It's more an exhibition game for the fans. Lots of goals, not a lot of hits and penalties and some skills. But they have to figure something out about that game. \"If the league put something on the line for them, like some extra money, it might improve it as a spectacle and guys might go harder. \"Unfortunately, two teams have to play in that game and on this occasion, it was us and Belfast. I'm sure after seeing that, the league may look at it.\" Sheffield Steelers took the silverware in an epic Sunday final, beating Cardiff Devils 6-5 after overtime in a game that lasted just under 95 minutes.

        "His meetings will focus on the relationship between the UK and Russia, as well as issues involving Syria and Ukraine \"where we continue to have significant differences,\" it said. The Foreign Office said the UK \"will engage with Russia where it is in our national interest to do so.\" The timings and details of the visit will be released \"in due course.\" A spokeswoman said: \"The foreign secretary has accepted an invitation from Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to visit Moscow in the coming weeks. \"The prime minister and the foreign secretary have made clear that our policy towards Russia is to'engage but beware' and the visit is entirely consistent with this approach. \"This is not a return to business as usual and the foreign secretary will continue to be robust on those issues where we differ.\" A Foreign Office source insisted that the visit did not signal any shift in UK policy towards Russia. \"He is not going in order to reset the relationship. He has been clear in his calls with Lavrov that this can't happen till they change course on issues such as Ukraine. \"He intends to say the same things face to face as we do in public and in Parliament about Russian activities. While it may be a tough visit, that is what needs to be done.\" The source added: \"Boris has always said we must engage when in our interests. He calls it'guarded engagement'. He will be robust in the meetings and defend our position. This is not about cosying up, in fact quite the opposite.\" Mr Johnson's trip will see him become the first minister to travel to Moscow for an official visit in more than five years. On a visit to Kiev last week, the foreign secretary said Russia's annexation of Crimea was illegal and insisted that it should be returned to Ukraine. He has also said there was no case for relaxing sanctions against Russia until it abided by the Minsk peace agreement. Mr Johnson has been hugely critical of Russia recently, accusing it of engaging in \"dirty tricks\" such as cyber attacks. The Russian embassy in London has responded by accusing him of trying to reopen the Cold War. Speaking in Germany last month, Mr Johnson told the BBC: \"You have got to engage with Russia, but you have got to engage in a very guarded way. You have got to beware of what they are up to. \"There is no question that, when you look at Russian activity on the cyber front, when you look at what they are doing in the western Balkans, when you look at what has been happening in the Ukraine, you've got to be very, very cautious. \"I think it is entirely right to have a dual track approach. We don't want to get into a new Cold War.\"",
        "After years of decline, the number of public authority homes sold in the year to March rose from 1,209 to 1,526. Ministers announced last year that right-to-buy, previously abolished for new tenants, was to end altogether. Statisticians concluded that the announcement was \"likely to be responsible\" for the upturn in sales. Over the same period, 1,140 new council homes were built in Scotland, the highest total in 25 years. The number of affordable homes also rose by 17, with 7,012 completed. Housing minister Margaret Burgess said: \"Over 4,000 new council houses have been delivered through the Scottish government's council house building programme since 2009. \"The supply of affordable housing continues to be a high priority for us and we are working with the entire sector to increase the supply of affordable homes and deliver vital support for construction and housebuilding companies throughout Scotland. \"Since 2011 we have delivered more than 21,000 new affordable homes, bringing us over two-thirds of the way towards our five-year target of 30,000 new homes.\" Across Scotland the total number of new homes increased by 7 over the past year to 15,957 - with Aberdeenshire, Edinburgh and Glasgow accounting for more than a quarter. The increase is the first since 200708 but the supply of new homes still remains well below pre-recession levels. Ms Burgess said: \"This is the first annual increase since before the recession, reflecting the growing confidence within the housing market, which the Scottish government has helped to stimulate through investment in initiatives designed to support the sector and help people into home ownership. \"Nonetheless, new housing supply remains well below pre-recession levels and I recognise that the housebuilding industry continues to face a number of challenges.\" The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA) broadly welcomed the new statistics. It said: \"The recognition, however, that we still have a very long way to go to recover from the 42 decrease in completions since then, is sobering and reflects the challenge to all providers of new housing. \"The drop in housing association completions represents the time lag between the introduction of the new subsidy levels in 2013 and the time taken to kick-start many projects previously unviable because of lower grant levels. \"However, the increase in approvals for housing association projects - up from 1,620 in 201213 to 2,875 in 201314 - gives some hope that we are beginning to recover from a devastating slowdown in the construction of social housing, at a time when almost one million Scots can't afford adequate housing conditions.\" Responding to the figures, trade body Homes for Scotland warned that sustained increases in production were now under threat after last month's announcement that the Scottish government's Help to Buy scheme had run out of money for this financial year. Chief executive Philip Hogg said: \"The figures show that the increase in supply was driven by the private sector and this clearly demonstrates the huge impact made by the very successful Help to Buy (Scotland) scheme, which has generated over 4,300 sales and reservations since launch less than a year ago. \"Whilst we applaud the Scottish government for introducing the scheme, funding for this year has already run out, leaving both buyers and builders very frustrated. \"The industry has effectively had the rug pulled from beneath it before any firm recovery has had the opportunity to take hold. \"And the impact is already apparent with significant drops in sales in the weeks since the budget expired in July. We therefore fear a return to decline in the months ahead.",

        "The women, who worked at Kinsley Academy, claimed their pay had been cut after the contract switched from Wakefield Council to CD Cleaning. The three women were reportedly dismissed by CD Cleaning on Monday. CD have been approached for comment but confirmed to the Guardian the trio had had their employment terminated. Labour MP for Hemsworth Jon Trickett said: \"With only days till Christmas it looks like Scrooge has been brought back to life from Victorian times.\" For updates and more stories from across West Yorkshire Lesley Leake, Karen McGee and Marice Hall went on strike in September saying their pay had been slashed and their pensions, holiday and sick pay had also been cut when the contract changed hands after the primary school became an academy. In October about 100 people joined the women on a protest march through Barnsley, where CD Cleaning is based. According to reports the women were sacked following a disciplinary hearing on 19 December. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"I am angered that three striking primary school cleaners from Kinsley have been sacked. \"When I met them, they explained how their wages were cut following the outsourcing of their contracts to a private company. \"Outsourcing is bad for our public services and workers. The cleaners' jobs must be brought back in-house with fair pay and conditions.\" The BBC has approached CD Cleaning for a comment. In a statement published in the Guardian, the company said the women had been invited to a disciplinary hearing to \"respond to allegations of gross misconduct.\" It said: \"The outcome of the hearing was termination of employment. \"The company will not comment further at this stage so as not prejudice any internal process.\" Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: \"These women bravely took action to protect their wages and employment rights. \"To then sack them just days before Christmas is heartless in the extreme.\"",

        "A 15-year-old boy told the BBC he survived by drinking water from wet clothes and eating clarified butter. Elsewhere, a woman was pulled from a collapsed block where she had been trapped alongside three bodies. Meanwhile, bad weather is hampering the delivery of relief to remote villages, a Nepali government spokesman said. The government has been criticised for its response to the disaster. Outside Kathmandu, the relief effort has relied heavily on helicopters, with mountain roads blocked by landslides triggered by the earthquake. Laxmi Dhakal, a spokesperson for Nepal's home ministry, told the BBC that helicopters had been held back by \"rainfall and cloudy conditions.\" In Kathmandu, rescue workers from Nepal and the US worked for hours to free the boy from the rubble of the building. A huge crowd cheered as Pemba Lama emerged, blinking into the sunlight. He was carried away with a brace strapped around his neck, and was taken to an Israeli-run field hospital. He later told the BBC: \"There were so many people around me in the rubble. They were screaming.\" The woman, called Krishna and in her 20s, was working as a maid in a Kathmandu hostel when the quake struck. The BBC's Clive Myrie, who was at the scene, says rescue teams from five different countries dug through the rubble for four hours to reach the woman who was awake but in a weak condition. They attached a saline drip to her arm to rehydrate her, and a dead body had to be removed before she could be brought out. In all, the rescue took more than eight hours. On Wednesday night, Nepalese soldiers in the town of Bhaktapur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, reportedly rescued an 11-year-old girl from earthquake rubble. The girl was freed from a damaged building in the town's Dattatreya Square, according to a tweet from Kunda Dixit, the editor of the Nepali Times newspaper. Meanwhile, medics say many who survived Saturday's 7.8-magnitude quake are now falling ill because they have been living in the open and drinking contaminated water. Binay Pandey, a doctor at Kathmandu's Bir Hospital, said at least 1,200 people with water-borne illnesses had been admitted since Wednesday morning. Climbing is expected to resume next week on Mount Everest, where avalanches triggered by the earthquake killed 18 people. Damaged ladders in an area of the mountain known as the Khumbu icefall would be repaired within the next few days, according to the chief of Nepal's tourism department, Tulsi Gautam. Frustration has been growing in parts of rural Nepal over the pace of relief efforts, with some badly-affected villages yet to receive any assistance. Late on Thursday the government said the death toll had risen to 6,130 with 13,827 injured. The UN says more than eight million people have been affected and about 70,000 houses destroyed. Dozens of countries are supporting the aid operation, contributing search-and-rescue teams, aircraft, medical supplies and communications equipment. How long can people survive under rubble? Satellite reveals quake movement Nepal quake special report Nepal's forgotten village Despite extensive damage, experts say the number of casualties in many villages was lower than feared because people were working outdoors when the quake struck. In Kathmandu, riot police clashed on Wednesday with protesters angry at a lack of transport out of the city and delays in distributing aid. However, there have been some signs that parts of the capital are returning to normal. Some people have decided to return to their homes, having spent several nights out in the open.

        "Eight people were found dead in the vehicle in a Walmart car park in San Antonio, Texas, and 31 others were treated. Two later died in hospital. The driver, named as James Mathew Bradley, 60, could face the death penalty. He says the immigrants were placed in his trailer while he was distracted. They were inside the trailer without access to air conditioning or water while outside temperatures hit 38C (100F). Police say they believe the incident is linked to people smuggling. Video footage from the store reportedly showed a number of vehicles arriving to pick up some of the survivors. Several others may have managed to escape on foot into the woods nearby. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting head Thomas Homan said more than 100 people could have been in the truck at one point. Mexico's government said it was working closely with US authorities to identify the nationalities of the victims. San Antonio is a few hours' drive from the border with Mexico, and the US immigration department is trying to establish the victims' legal status. Officials were brought to the trailer by a man who had approached an employee of the Walmart store and asked for water. San Antonio police chief William McManus said in a press briefing that the people ranged from school age to in their 30s. Local fire chief Charles Hood said the survivors had heart rates of over 130 beats per minute and were very hot to touch. The fire chief confirmed at least two of the victims were school-age children. Their condition is not clear. The US attorney for the Western District of Texas, Richard Durbin, said the people were helpless victims of \"ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the wellbeing of their fragile cargo.\" Experts say people smuggling is a serious issue in southern Texas, and there have been a number of similar cases in the area just in this past month. On 7 July, US Border Patrol agents found 72 undocumented immigrants from Central American countries locked inside a trailer \"with no means of escape.\" The next day 33 people were found locked inside a trailer at a checkpoint on the road to San Antonio.",

Properties in the Alps have been seized in a separate Swiss investigation. The US authorities are working closely with their Swiss counterparts, and held a joint news conference in Zurich to provide updates on their respective investigations into world football's governing body. \"The scope of our investigation is not limited, and we are following the evidence where it leads,\" said Lynch. \"I am grateful for the significant co-operation and substantial evidence that we have received from all quarters.\" In June, Fifa president Sepp Blatter announced he would resign less than a week after he was re-elected, saying \"his mandate did not appear to be supported by everyone.\" Lynch would not say whether Blatter, 79, is a target of the US investigation. The Swiss investigation is looking into bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, to be held in Russia and Qatar respectively. Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber said 11 terabytes of information had been seized \"so far.\" He added that 121 different bank accounts had been brought to the attention of the investigating task force, and said they were \"not even at half-time\" in their investigation. Lauber confirmed that Swiss prosecutors will also investigate a Fifa contract for media rights to the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.",
        "The Nikkei 225 closed down 0.4 at 18,916.02, although the index had been as much as 1.6 in earlier trade. Shares in Toshiba fell 9.8 on reports it was expecting record losses for the year to March. After the market closed, Toshiba said it would cut 6,800 jobs at its consumer electronics division and report a record loss of 550bn yen (4.53bn). The news follows findings that Toshiba had overstated its operating profit for the past six years by a total of 151.8bn yen. The US dollar fell to 121.20 yen, compared with last week's rate of 123 yen after the US rate rise, and the stronger yen weighed on Japan's major exporters. Toyota shares closed down more than 1 and Honda ended down 0.7. A stronger yen makes the products Japan's big exporters make more expensive to buy overseas. Lower oil prices continued to weigh on energy-related shares. The price of Brent Crude fell to its lowest since 2004 in overnight trade to 36.17 a barrel, before recovering slightly to 36.49.

        "The good stuff is silicon-28, and physicists in the US have worked out how to produce it with 40 times greater purity than ever before. Even better, they can do it in the lab instead of relying on samples made ten years ago in a huge, repurposed plutonium plant in St Petersburg. This promises to solve a serious supply problem in quantum computing research. Several of the most promising schemes for building a quantum computer are based in silicon. One that has received much attention stores \"qubits\" in atoms of another element, like phosphorous, embedded in a tiny layer of ultra-pure silicon-28. Qubits are the quantum replacement for bits - the ones and zeros that represent information inside a conventional computer. They promise to usher in a new era of computing because they can simultaneously encode a one and a zero, enabling incredibly fast and complex calculations. The difficulty for silicon-based designs is that normal silicon contains quite a lot of atoms that aren't silicon-28. Almost 8 of a commercial silicon wafer is made up of other isotopes like silicon-29, which would cause interference in a quantum chip. \"It leads to decoherence, which is sort of like ADD in computers,\" explained Dr Joshua Pomeroy, one of the physicists behind the new work, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Maryland. Researchers in this field, like Dr Pomeroy, have been relying on off-cuts of enriched silicon-28 that all started out in Russia. The St Petersburg facility is a repurposed plutonium enrichment plant, housing industrial-scale gas centrifuges which were commissioned in 2004, by German scientists, to produce a sample of silicon-28 with 99.99 purity. That sample was used to crystallise 5kg of the stuff, at a cost of around one million euros, for an international effort to calculate Avogadro's number from 1kg, perfect spheres of silicon-28. Waste material from this project has been almost the only global source of this high-quality silicon ever since. Dr Pomeroy explained that the quantum community \"can't command the resources\" to commission that type of production. \"It's fortuitous that the Avogadro project existed,\" he told the BBC. \"So there's sort of a nervousness - when they wrap up finally, and they're not buying any more of it, what are we going to do?\" But Dr Pomeroy and his colleagues have now shown that small amounts of silicon-28, enriched to an unprecedented 99.9998, can be produced using equipment already found in many labs. They managed the feat with kit that is normally used for mass spectrometry - a technique for identifying a substance based on the weight of the different atoms it contains. By pumping ions of silicon through a big magnetic field, the different isotopes (atoms of silicon with different weights) can be separated from each other, because heavier atoms are diverted less by the magnet than lighter ones. Dr Pomeroy said this was an unexpectedly simple solution. \"We had what often happens in science, which is that we had an apparatus whose purpose had come to an end. And we had a problem that needed solving, and we married them up.\" The thin films of silicon-28 that his team can produce are very, very pure - but also very small. \"It's much more difficult to produce large quantities,\" Dr Pomeroy concedes, \"but particularly in the research phase, those quantities are largely unnecessary.\" Despite some controversial commercial initiatives, quantum computers primarily remain a field of research. And according to Dr Pomeroy, the new approach is more than capable of delivering enough of the purer-than-pure silicon for scientists to test out their designs. Importantly, researchers around the world could potentially make it in their own labs. \"We're recognising that we don't need to produce an entire wafer's worth of silicon-28 that's enriched,\" he said. \"We only really need to make enough to insulate the computer from the rest of the wafer.\" The team's research was published in the Journal of Physics D.

        "Llanberis Mountain Rescue was called out a record 43 times to Wales and England's highest peak in August - an increase it called \"unsustainable.\" Visit Wales' recent year of adventure campaign encouraged to visitors to \"Find Your Epic.\" The tourism body said the campaign was \"an opportunity to promote safety.\" Llanberis Mountain Rescue said many of those tackling the peak were unprepared in terms of knowledge and equipment, with many needing assistance. Chairman of the team of volunteers, Rob Johnson, said \"serious consideration\" needed to be given to how the 3,560 ft (1,085m) peak was managed. He said the drive to attract tourists contributed to an \"unsustainable\" rise in callouts - from 34 in August 2015 to 43 in August 2016. The organisation relies on donations and about 1,000 volunteer hours were spent attending incidents - including an RAF helicopter crash landing. He said many of the callouts were preventable and, with the right knowledge and equipment, they could have been avoided. \"We've attended a variety of incidents this summer but the most common have been lower-leg injuries, people too tired to continue and people crag-fast on Crib Goch,\" said Mr Johnson. \"It has been a massive commitment from a small group of volunteers.\" Visit Wales, the Welsh Government's tourism team, said it encouraged visitors to participate in activities with accredited providers. A spokeswoman added: \"The year of adventure is also an opportunity to promote safety in the great outdoors. \"Mountain rescue teams do great work in helping people, but as the adventure sector continues to grow there is no doubt rescue teams will need the help of educators in minimising the risk of people needing their assistance. \"That's why we will continue to work with partners and the industry so that people can enjoy Wales and be safe.\"",

        "Houses at Auvers II was hung in the Picnic Cafe on Friday to launch the Open for Art weekend festival. David Brooks, from Toronto, Canada, has been a van Gogh specialist for 18 years and claims it is not genuine. Owner Mark Lawrence insists it is a real van Gogh, but admits it has not yet been authenticated. Mr Brooks, who the Van Gogh Museum said \"owns the largest van Gogh website in the world,\" told the BBC it was not a known work by the artist. \"To me it screams'not van Gogh',\" he said, adding: \"It's not well executed, the style is quite poor.\" The Van Gogh Museum, in Amsterdam, is the only place that can officially authenticate a van Gogh work. Mr Lawrence said he had been working with the museum to get the painting researched since the beginning of the year. The museum said it had received an email from Mr Lawrence on Monday, and had advised him to send a request for research along with a photograph of the painting. It added an investigation could take weeks or sometimes months, depending on the type of inquiry required. Mr Lawrence said: \"We are doing everything that would normally be done to get it authenticated.\" In relation to Mr Brooks' comments, he said: \"It can't be fully authenticated simply from looking at a photograph, it has to be tested.\" He also said it was possible the painting had areas of over-paint from restoration which \"covers up some of the details.\" \"There's a lot of heavy cracking on our painting too which is commonly found in van Gogh work particularly ones he painted thickly, and it also has a protective thick varnish on it,\" he added. Mr Lawrence previously said he inherited the painting from his grandfather who died in 1980, along with 200 other paintings. The 27-year-old director of the web-based Reading Gallery is looking for a permanent home for his collection, which is currently in storage and is said to include works by Rembrandt, Picasso, and Dali. He said House at Auvers II was bought in the 1920s by his great-grandfather for 300 francs in Paris, and added it was not known to the art world because it had been in his family since before van Gogh's works were first catalogued in the 1930s.",
        "This baby can survive a 1400 revolutions per minute spin in the washing machine. You could say it makes for easy laundering. The Bank of England says it is cleaner and more secure than the cotton paper notes which have been used for the past 100 years. But we're a conservative lot in Northern Ireland: Perhaps we like our lucre filthy. For people in Northern Ireland, plastic fivers are nothing new. To celebrate the Millennium, the old Northern Bank (now Danske) introduced the slippery clean fiver to local pockets in 2000. Two million of the notes were issued in October 1999. It did not fold quite the same into the back trouser pocket. But then again, neither did it attract the dirt from fingers fumbling in a greasy till or handbag to quite the same degree. That was more than 16 years ago, and the trusty paper notes are still going strong. If you get a polymer note these days in Belfast, look up and you might see a pig soar past city hall. In 2005, the Northern Bank reprinted all of its bank notes shortly after PS26.5m was stolen from its head office by the IRA. The plastic fiver was the only type of note not replaced. Paul Black from Danske Bank said that when the plastic fiver was introduced, it meant Northern Bank was \"away ahead of its time.\" \"We wanted to be innovative and be first on the market. Over time that was eroded a little, because other banks did not follow. At the time it was quite popular,\" he said. \"It did create a real buzz. People found it unusual. They compared it to monopoly money.\" Down the backs of which sofas do the lost plastic fivers reside? Who knows? But on a well-known internet auction site one seller is asking for PS125 for the plastic note. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said the new note would be cleaner, safer and stronger. \"The use of polymer means it can better withstand being repeatedly folded into wallets or scrunched up inside pockets, and can also survive a spin in the washing machine,\" he said. While the notes are not indestructible, they are expected to last an average of five years compared to the current fiver's two years. New security features - such as a transparent window - will make the note harder to counterfeit.",
        "The fatwa, which is not legally binding but will be influential, was issued after a three-day congress of female clerics in the country. The clerics urged the government to raise the minimum legal age for women to marry to 18 from the current 16. Indonesia is a majority Muslim country and has among the highest number of child brides in the world. According to the UN's children office Unicef, one in four women in Indonesia marries before the age of 18. Fatwas are issued regularly in Indonesia, but usually by the Indonesian Ulema Council - the highest Islamic authority in the country which is made up almost entirely of men. Hundreds of women descended on Cirebon, on Java Island, for the Indonesian KUPI Women's Ulema Congress. Most of the clerics - experts in Islamic sacred law and theology - were from Indonesia, but speakers travelled from as far away as Kenya, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to take part in the conference, said to be the first major gathering of female Muslim clerics. Female clerics, or \"ulema,\" have existed in Indonesia for hundreds of years, but their role has been played down previously. Nowadays, they help empower their communities and lead educational institutes, organisers say. It is hoped the congress will highlight the vital role they play. Steering committee chairman Badriyah Fayumi told the BBC: \"Through this conference, we want to state that female clerics exist, and have been proven to contribute, and this is the time to acknowledge their existence, and to give an appreciation for the.... contribution of the female clergy.\" The committee will now present its recommendations to the relevant groups - including the government - which will then decide on whether or not to take them any further. The fatwa called underage marriage \"harmful\" and said preventing it was mandatory. \"Female clerics know the issues and obstacles women face, we can take action and do not just wait for the government to protect these children,\" Ninik Rahayu, the conference organiser, told Reuters. The female clerics cited studies which highlight that many Indonesian child brides are not allowed to continue their education and half the marriages end in divorce. The child marriage fatwa was one of a series issued during the congress. There were also edicts against women being sexually abused, and environmental destruction.

A web cam in his cab showed the brake lights ahead for 17 seconds before the collision. Graham admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He also pleaded guilty to two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. A collision report said Graham had not reacted or braked at all, and the court heard the cause of his inattention remained a mystery. He was not using a mobile phone, was not tired or ill, and had driven about two million miles over the previous years without incident. Wayne Cleaver, prosecuting, told Luton Crown Court the couple who died were grandparents Martin Spratt, 70 and his wife Evelyn, 68, of Buckden, Cambridgeshire.

        "Inverness-born Gillan's big break came when she was cast as Doctor Who companion Amy Pond. While Pond was part of a force for good, Gillan's character in Guardians of the Galaxy has a villainous dark side. With a reported production budget of PS17m, Guardians of the Galaxy forms part of Marvel's so-called \"Phase 2\" project. The first phase involved the development and release of superhero movies featuring well-known comic book characters such as Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. Guardians' cast includes Chris Pratt, who provided the voice for Emmet Brickowoski in box office hit The Lego Movie, and Zoe Saldana, who starred in Avatar and the two recent Star Trek movies. Directed by James Gunn, Guardians of the Galaxy draws on characters and stories that first appeared in Marvel comics in 1969. Gillan's character Nebula first appeared in the comics in 1985. Last July, Gillan unveiled part of her look for the film at Comic-Con International in San Diego, one of the world's biggest celebrations of comic books and movies based on them. During a press conference with other cast members, she removed a wig to reveal a shaven head. At the UK premiere for Guardians of the Galaxy earlier this week, Gillan told the BBC how designers working on the new Star Wars film made the wig she wore at Comic-Con. Gillan's character, Nebula, has been described in the Marvel comics as a ruthless space pirate and former leader of a band of mercenaries. There are glimpses of Gillan in trailers being seen in cinemas and online ahead of the movie's release. The actress also features on the cover of a special edition of the August issue of UK film magazine, Empire. On the cover with her are Djimon Hounsou, who plays Korath the Pursuer and previously starred with Russell Crowe in Gladiator, and Hobbit films actor Lee Pace who plays the film's chief bad guy Ronan the Accuser. After Guardians of the Galaxy, Gillan is set to star in the Western, In a Valley of Violence. The film's cast also includes Grease and Pulp Fiction actor John Travolta, Training Day's Ethan Hawke and American Horror Story's Taissa Farmiga. Gillan, who as a youngster performed at Inverness' Eden Court Theatre, will also appear on US television this autumn. She has been cast as the lead in new ABC series, Selfie. The Scot plays Eliza Dooley who has 263,000 social media followers who hang on to her every post, tweet and selfie. Eliza seeks help from a marketing guru played by John Cho, no stranger himself to strange, new alien worlds as Sulu in the Star Treks films, to \"re-brand\" her self-obsessed reputation.

        "\"I have been asked in my younger years to consider joining, and I just never felt ready or prepared,\" said Ms Seifert, who started working as a model at the age of 14 and later worked as a television presenter. But the moment finally arrived in 2009, after she had finished a nursing degree in New York. At the age of 25 - the limit for most pageants - time was running out. Ms Seifert trained for over a month at a so-called beauty camp, setting her sights on representing the Philippines at the Miss Universe competition. But she said pageant organisers disqualified her days before the finals over bikini photos published in a men's magazine. Undaunted, she decided to take part in another national pageant weeks later. Not only did she win the national Miss Earth title, she went on to compete in the international pageant, where she was crowned runner-up out of 80 competitors from all over the world. Beauty pageants have been popular in the Philippines since they were brought to the country by the American colonial government in the first half of the 20th Century, says Jose Wendell Capili, an academic at the University of the Philippines in the capital, Manila. Opposition from feminists, if there is any, is muted. The recent successes of candidates in international competitions have heightened interest even further. Mr Capili, who wrote a book about Philippine pageants, says that as a result, pageants have become more competitive. \"In the old days, an untrained candidate may end up winning a title either because she is a great beauty or is someone from a pedigreed family,\" he said. \"These days, there are talent scouts and modelling agencies who actually train some of the girls, months, even years, before the national competition.\" One of the most successful beauty camps is headed by Jonas Gaffud, who is CEO of a large modelling agency, Mercator. He and a teams of mentors field an average of 10 candidates a year. The mentors work for free, and many of the women dominate the national pageants and go on to place well internationally. Mr Gaffud is credited with helping Megan Young win the first Miss World crown for the Philippines in 2013. His team's beauty queens have also been finalists in every Miss Universe pageant since 2010. Some have also placed in previous Miss World and Miss International finals. In scouting a potential candidate, Mr Gaffud said that height - at least five feet five inches tall (165.1cm) - and \"the beauty of face\" were most important. But training was just as important. He said candidates need to start training at least six months before a competition. This included studying the pageant's cause, learning how to walk on stage, knowing how to do hair and make-up, exercising to tone the physique and practicing how to answer questions, he said. Ms Seifert, who trained at another beauty camp, said that the hours spent training were intense. \"There are different exercises that you do, all the way from head to toe. Stretching, neck rotations, really tough waist movements to shape your waist,\" she said. One exercise was called the \"duck walk\" and involved walking in circles in a bikini at a dance studio lined with mirrors. \"Just imagine doing lunges in high heels with a book or several books on your head - and they cannot fall,\" she said. And despite her previous experience as a television host, she still received coaching for the pageant QA, as well as advice from former pageant winners. Like Ms Seifert, Sian Elizabeth Maynard also trained at a beauty camp before taking part in a national pageant, even after successfully winning three local titles. She did calisthenics exercises and walking training, which included \"doing weird lunges and wiggling.\" Sian Elizabeth Maynard, now 27, did not really want to join beauty pageants. But she says her mum \"begged me to, so I joined a local one.\" She joined three local pageants a year from 2007 to 2009 - two in Cebu province in central Philippines and one national pageant - and won all titles. She was one of 10 finalists in Miss Philippines-Earth in 2010. They were not all pleasant experiences. Once, some of the candidates' sashes - which must be worn at all times in the competition - went missing. Replacements were quickly made, but some women ended up wearing their sashes even while brushing their teeth. Ms Maynard slept with hers under her pillow. \"In other pageants, someone would cut the strap of a bikini or the strap of a sandal,\" she said. \"The number one rule is that you have to watch your belongings because there could be a lot of theft, like make-up and cell phones go missing,\" Ms Maynard said. But she had good memories too, and said she made many friends. She learned how to dress up and present herself, when before joining she \"didn't even know or bother to comb my hair.\" \"So when we do these lunges, and we wiggle our hips, it's really tiresome. And we all do this in four-inch heels minimum. It helps us to lengthen our stride and to put more sway in our hips,\" Ms Maynard said. Sometimes she had to do the high-heeled lunges while answering questions called out by her mentors. \"And then, every so often while we're doing it, one of them [trainers] would just call out a question, like you know,'If you had to take out an element out the universe, which element would it be and why? Earth, wind, fire or water?' \"It's really not just about smiling and standing in front of people. It's a lot of hard work,\" said Ms Maynard, now 27. Even the tiny details matter, Mr Gaffud said. He helps pick the right outfits and involves himself with how a candidate \"should sway on stage.\" He even helps pick a candidate's lipstick shade - anything to help improve her chances. He said mentors tried to build on a candidate's natural traits, such as whether to cultivate a sweet or sexy image. Some mentors do charge for their services, but most like Mr Gaffud do it \"for the love of finding a girl.\" \"This is a side project,\" he said, adding that mentors help pay for the candidate's make-up, pictorials, food and sometimes even their rent. Some mentors, however, go on to manage their beauty queen's careers after they are successful in pageants. \"They don't expect us to pay for anything, which I just find really amazing,\" said Ms Seifert, \"because these pageant aficionados have full-time jobs, but they really dedicate so much of themselves to helping us develop and train,\" she said. Becoming a beauty queen is not always glamorous, Ms Seifert cautioned. \"The moment I got crowned was the moment all the hard work began,\" she said. In her case, being a Miss Philippines-Earth winner and Miss Earth runner-up meant many public appearances to promote environmental causes. Pageant winners have high public profiles in the Philippines, and winning a title is seen as coming with big responsibilities. As \"an important public figure,\" it was important to set a good example to young girls who looked up to beauty queens, Ms Seifert said. Winners are feted, introduced to high-ranking officials, and often recognised on the street and asked to pose for photographs. Anjo Lorenzana, a lecturer from the Ateneo de Manila University who specialises in media and popular culture, said pageants were also an opportunity for the Philippines to promote its image on an international stage. \"By winning international beauty contests, Filipinos, who are usually equated with lowly occupations, can be seen in a better light,\" he said. For the candidates, pageants can be a stepping stone for upward social or economic mobility, Jose Wendell Capili said. He added that Filipinos were deeply passionate about pageants, pointing to heated online discussions. \"Rooting for a particular candidate can sometimes break up families, friendships and relationships,\" he said. Tammy David, who has been photographing pageants since 2007, said the most unusual pageant she shot was inside a large jail. \"You could see how parents were proud because their daughter was Little Miss Bureau of Corrections,\" Ms David said. \"Beauty pageants are everywhere.\"",
        "The Environment Agency (EA), which manages it, has chosen the Severn and Wye fish smokery as its preferred bidder to become its new custodian. In 2014, the EA said it was looking for an investor to \"secure the long-term future of the important historic site.\" Lydney Harbour was built in the early 1800s to transport iron and later coal. Richard Cook, of the smokery, said he would now work with the local community, the council and the EA \"to help develop and promote what we believe to be one of the Forest of Dean's hidden gems.\" Ian Jones, from the EA, said: \"We see transferring the harbour as an essential step in revitalising the area and ensuring that all users retain the ability to use the harbour and its surroundings with enhanced facilities.\" The EA said it would continue to manage and operate the harbour while negotiations - expected to \"take a while\" - were completed. During its heyday, the harbour saw about 300,000 tons of coal being exported annually in more than 2,000 vessels. The final export of coal was in 1960 and it finally closed in 1977.",
        "The officer said he found the black animal toy wearing an officer's shirt at a police station in central London. Scotland Yard promised to look into the matter but the detective was himself investigated for making the story up. He was later cleared at a misconduct hearing and received damages from the force after taking legal action. The details emerged after a separate case at Thames Valley Police in which an officer put a monkey on a black colleague's desk. A misconduct panel concluded last month that Det Sgt Andrew Mottau was not being racist but should have realised the toy animal could be offensive. The incident involving the Metropolitan Police began in September 2013 when the Indian-born detective constable claimed to have seen a large monkey toy in the office of the Case Progression Unit at Belgravia police station. He said the stuffed black toy had a police officer's shirt on and a label saying \"night-duty ERO\" - Evidential Review Officer. One of the EROs at the time was a black police officer. The detective was concerned the use of the toy was racist and had not been investigated properly. He raised the matter during a live internal website chat known as the \"Commissioner's Forum,\" where staff are encouraged to discuss problems with the Met Commissioner, who at the time was Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. The detective received an online reply saying: \"What is described - if accurate - is unacceptable\" and was told that it would be looked into \"immediately.\" But a month later, the detective himself was put under investigation for allegedly posting \"untrue and potentially inflammatory comments.\" He was told his actions had \"breached the standards of professional behaviour.... relating to \"honesty and integrity\" and \"discreditable conduct,\" claims which, if proved, could have led to his dismissal Eventually, in June 2015, after protracted internal disciplinary proceedings, the officer attended a gross misconduct hearing where it was ruled there was \"no case to answer\" and he was cleared. Paul Turpin, who was a representative for the Metropolitan Police Federation and supported the officer through the process, said: \"I was surprised when the matter was referred to a gross misconduct hearing and was not surprised when that hearing found the officer had no case to answer.\" He suggested the allegation should never have got that far: \"Matters should be dealt with at the lowest appropriate level at the earliest possible opportunity.\" Scotland Yard said there had been an \"internal review\" of the handling of the case after the hearing. It said the original allegation about the monkey had been \"investigated locally and progressed as far as it could be,\" though the inquiry was unable to establish who had placed the black toy animal in the police station. The Asian detective, who has not been named by the BBC at his own request, began legal proceedings against the Met at an employment tribunal alleging he had been racially discriminated against and victimised. But before a full hearing took place the force reached a settlement and agreed to pay damages. The details of the agreement are confidential but the amount of compensation is thought to be in the region of PS35,000. The officer declined to comment and has not divulged any details of the agreement to the BBC. The Met confirmed a settlement had been reached \"following judicial mediation\" at the Tribunal Services in March 2016. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin, who is in charge of professionalism at Scotland Yard, said the force had made \"significant investment\" in improving the way it handled staff complaints linked to discrimination, bullying or harassment and had introduced a new \"whistle-blowing\" policy. \"We have long recognised that people.... fear being victimised if they raise a complaint, regardless of whether that fear is justified,\" he said. \"That has never been acceptable and we continue to make it very clear to our staff that victimisation will never be tolerated, that it will be investigated, and will have serious repercussions if it occurs.\" But Janet Hills, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, said the use of a black monkey toy and the treatment of the Asian police detective indicated there was still a long way to go. \"We're still trying to get rid of the dinosaurs in policing who are still protecting that culture,\" she said, describing the \"monkey\" incident as \"unbelievable\" and \"unacceptable.\" \"It's not just a toy, it's a toy to be used to say'this is what I think of you',\" she said. \"It's racist and discriminatory behaviour,\" she said, adding that it went on because people thought they could \"get away with it.\" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning",

        "The pre-tournament favourites - last knocked out of this competition in 1993 - had led when Isabel Kerschowski fired in early on. But Nadia Nadim nodded Denmark level after half-time and Theresa Nielsen's late header completed the comeback. It is only Germany's third loss in the 26-year history of the competition. The Olympic champions - ranked second in the world - created plenty of chances but were also frequently opened up at the back by a Denmark side who, after a nervy start, became increasingly dangerous. The opener came courtesy of a goalkeeping error, as Stina Lykke Petersen misjudged Kerschowski's fierce shot from the edge of the area and could only parry the German's shot in to the net. After the break, Germany hesitated when they thought they had conceded a free-kick only for the referee to play an advantage that Denmark took, with Portland Thorns forward Nadim jumping well at the far post to nod in the equaliser. Plenty of openings for both sides followed as the game became stretched with the prospect of extra time looming. Another right-wing cross found Nielsen unmarked in the Germany penalty area on 83 minutes and she headed in to spark wild Danish celebrations. The result guaranteed that the tournament will have a different winner for the first time since Norway's triumph in 1993, with Germany having won the following six European Championships.

        "The Tribunal de Commerce decided SeaFrance's future after a bailout by the French government was ruled illegal by the European Commission. The court also said an offer by a cooperative of employees was not acceptable. Hundreds of jobs in France are also expected to be lost. Three ferries were operated by SeaFrance on the Dover to Calais route. The service was suspended in November. Conservative MP for Dover and Deal Charlie Elphicke said: \"It is a real concern for the.... people in Dover who have worked for SeaFrance and also their families. \"This is a difficult day and I think the heart of the whole community goes out to them. \"Obviously it's a real blow, [if] SeaFrance isn't operating that means there's less ferry traffic.\" There were tears from SeaFrance workers who gathered outside the court in Paris to hear the decision on the firm's future. Many were protesting over the handling of SeaFrance's fate, with one banner questioning why French president, Nikolas Sarkozy had not intervened to save the company. Flares were lit in protest at the company's liquidation. Eurotunnel has not ruled out a future bid for the cross-channel ferry firm, which employs nearly 1,000 people. Mr Elphicke said of Eurotunnel's proposals: \"Many people will want to know that they weren't simply going to buy them [SeaFrance's ferries] in order to scrap them. \"We need to make sure they give a clear plan as to why they are interested in the ferry business and not simply going to take out capacity. \"Everyone is working as hard as they can to ensure that their jobs will be safeguarded and working as hard as they can to ensure that those ships will be back on route with a new buyer and a new purchaser.\" A spokesman said Eurotunnel would \"now be working to see what the fair value of the assets\" were before making any decision. The French firm went into receivership in 2010 and its company's ferries carried more than 3.5 million passengers a year on the Dover to Calais route. A spokeswoman from SeaFrance said: \"SeaFrance is sad to announce that the Tribunal de Commerce in Paris has made the decision to liquidate the company. \"Despite the best efforts of all parties, the court came to the difficult conclusion that none of the options available to it were financially viable. \"Provision has been made to ensure that all customers with pre-existing bookings will receive refunds.\" She urged customers to contact SeaFrance for details.",
        "Terry, the founder and chief executive of Ashleys Kenya, a beauty company with more than 240 employees, adds: \"But now all that has changed. You are considered an entrepreneur.\" Twenty years ago when her then-employer, Diners International, quit Nairobi she did what she had always wanted to do, and opened a hair salon. Today, walking around one of her 12 hair salons in the upmarket Lavington area of Nairobi, she greets her clients with a broad smile as she moves along the row of hairdryers. Towards one corner of the room, three hairdressers hover over a customer as they twist and turn her hair braids. In a partially enclosed area, another woman enjoys a manicure and pedicure while sipping orange juice. The pampering is part of the company's mission statement - to be the most professionally run chain of salons in Kenya. And it is not just the customers who are getting a makeover - so are Terry's recruits. As her business grew she realised there was a need for a larger skilled workforce. \"We realised that we could not sustain the business without training,\" she explains. Terry now runs three training centres under the Ashleys brand that offer her students internationally respected beauty qualifications. The training centres also offer services to members of the public as a way of providing real-life experience to the students. There is a hushed tone in one classroom as students undertake a mock examination in hairdressing, a teacher is watching keenly as the students work. Within two weeks the students in this class will undertake their final examinations before graduating. Some of the students who graduate from the training centres are taken on by Terry while others are hired by other companies. Ashleys is also the current holder of the local franchise of the Miss World beauty pageant - known as Miss World Kenya. The BBC's business teams across Africa meet the continent's entrepreneurs who are starting up new enterprises and seeking to create big opportunities. Read more: New Entrepreneurs \"We were sponsors for two years and when they were ready to change the franchise holder, they approached me, and asked whether we would be interested,\" says Terry. Auditions for Miss World Kenya are usually carried out in different parts of the country before a final elimination round is held and the overall winner announced. \"I have a bias in trying to bring up young women to have confidence in themselves and create employment. I want women to celebrate their beauty,\" she says. But it hasn't all been easy. After the terrorist attack at Nairobi's Westgate shopping centre in September 2013, in which more than 65 people were killed, the company was forced to shut down one of its branches, which was located in the complex. Terry has since opened a new branch in a different mall and the staff have been relocated. Not content with 12 salons, three training schools and running the national beauty pageant, she is also heading into retail. The first Ashleys cosmetic shop has already opened in Nairobi. \"It makes it easier for clients and other outsiders to come and get premium products from us,\" she says. \"Now that we have ventured into cosmetics, I would not rule out Ashleys starting our own line in the future.\"",

        "Rohan Rhodes should have had blood tests on three occasions in the hours before he died at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol, coroner Maria Voisin said. A narrative conclusion was recorded at Flax Bourton Coroner's Court. The hospital trust said a safety check system has since been introduced. Ms Voisin told an inquest into his death that there were \"lost opportunities\" to give Rohan earlier medical care before his death when the tests were not carried out. Rohan, from Narberth, was born 15 weeks early at Singleton Hospital in Swansea in August 2012, but was transferred five weeks later to St Michael's Hospital in Bristol for specialist surgery to his heart. The \"extremely premature baby\" died there aged just 36 days old. The inquest into Rohan's death has heard how he deteriorated soon after a ventilator was removed without the consent of his parents or senior hospital staff. Medical staff wept as they told the three-day hearing how the baby's condition dramatically worsened. The inquest heard the baby was not allowed to die in his mother's arms despite her wishes because staff were unable to remove lines from his body. Rohan had been transferred to St Michael's Hospital for surgery to repair an open heart duct. His parents Alex and Bronwyn Rhodes told the coroners' court on Monday about concerns they had about their son's treatment. They said that Rohan's feeding tubes were inserted \"aggressively\" and caused him pain. The couple said they did not want any other child to suffer as Rohan did. Following the inquest Mr and Mrs Rhodes said they were planning to take legal action against the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital where their son died. Bryony Strachan, of the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, apologised that opportunities to carry out tests on Rohan were missed, and said safety systems have since been introduced. \"The coroner has confirmed that what those results would have been remains unknown, but we are very sorry that those three checks were missed, within continuous monitoring of Rohan's critical condition within NICU (neonatal intensive-care unit),\" she said. \"We have already put in place clear requirements for blood gas measurements in babies on respiratory support and have implemented a system of safety checking shared by both medical and nursing staff looking after individual babies,\" she added. On Tuesday the court heard from medical staff at the hospital who said the plan had been to keep Rohan on the ventilator. However, the hearing was told advanced neonatal nurse Amanda Dallorzo took the \"autonomous\" decision to extubate (remove a tube from the airway), remove the baby from the machine, and apply a breathing mask instead. Rohan's condition dramatically deteriorated and he died the following day. Mrs Rhodes said: \"We were terrified and were watching all this in horror. He was so pale and lifeless during this time, we were terrified we were losing him.\" Dr David Harding, Rohan's consultant, told the inquest that the weekend Rohan died was the \"busiest and worst weekend of his career.\" The court also heard that there were fewer nurses on the ward that weekend than there should have been. A \"root cause analysis\" report looking at the cause of Rohan's death concluded the ward was understaffed.",
        "The portal, for the match against Poland, will be open to supporters on a priority list who were were informed they had missed out on Tuesday. UEFA is to make about 1,000 extra tickets available to Northern Ireland fans. Northern Ireland are to play Poland, Ukraine and Germany in France in June. On Tuesday, the IFA said it was \"inundated\" with calls from angry Northern Ireland fans unable to purchase tickets. Some fans who said they ranked near the top of the IFA's'priority list' missed out on tickets for the Poland game. Particularly affected were fans who applied for category 3 tickets, the second cheapest kind. \"We discovered there was an issue yesterday morning on this with quite a number of people finding they hadn't got tickets in category 3 for the Poland game,\" IFA chief executive Patrick Nelson said. \"We got straight onto Uefa and with Uefa's senior management team, we've worked through that issue now. We've identified with Uefa that there's almost another 1,000 tickets that they're going to make available for us, particularly for those fans. \"The 900 or so fans that we're talking about here will have priority access, in fact specific access, to a portal that Uefa are setting up and they should be able to buy tickets. \"We've been talking to Uefa for not quite the last 24 hours, but probably 21 of the last 24 hours over this and we're fairly confident that Uefa will manage this in the right way.\" A points system had been put in place for the games to establish a priority list for tickets, favouring fans who had attended the most matches at home and abroad. However, on Tuesday Gary McAllister from the Amalgamation of Official NI Supporters Clubs said many fans were now asking whether the loyalty scheme has been implemented correctly. He missed out on a ticket to the Poland game, despite having 27 loyalty points out of a possible 29. In the Republic of Ireland, fans have not yet heard if they have been successful in securing tickets. Irish Times chief football writer Emmet Malone said the experience of Northern Ireland supporters has worried fans in the Republic of Ireland. Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme on Wednesday, Mr Malone said there was \"a lot of pessimism\" among Ireland fans. \"The FAI [Football Association of Ireland] is supposed to start informing people, possibly as early as this afternoon, as to who got tickets here,\" he said. \"But our applications were far more oversubscribed than the IFA's, so a lot of people are very concerned about what will happen.\" Mr Malone said there was particular concern that the FAI's loyalty scheme was only introduced in 2015, so is it relatively new. \"The FAI have been quite vague with fan groups over requests to publish the points that everybody has, how the categories break down, who's going to be compared with who in terms of pecking order. \"That vagueness is going to lead to an awful lot of bad feeling here over the next few days.\"",
        "The weather phenomenon is set to exacerbate droughts in some areas, while increasing flooding in others. Some of the worst impacts are likely in Africa with food shortages expected to peak in February. Regions including the Caribbean, Central and South America will also be hit in the next six months. This periodic weather event, which tends to drive up global temperatures and disturb weather patterns, has helped push 2015 into the record books as the world's warmest year. \"By some measures this has already been the strongest El Nino on record. It depends on exactly how you measure it,\" said Dr Nick Klingaman from the University of Reading. \"In a lot of tropical countries we are seeing big reductions in rainfall of the order of 20-30. Indonesia has experienced a bad drought; the Indian monsoon was about 15 below normal; and the forecasts for Brazil and Australia are for reduced monsoons.\" As both droughts and floods continue, the scale of the potential impacts is worrying aid agencies. Around 31 million people are said to be facing food insecurity across Africa, a significant increase over the last year. Around a third of these people live in Ethiopia where 10.2 million are projected to require humanitarian assistance in 2016. Can Ethiopia cope with drought? South Africa grapples with worst drought in 30 years El Nino is a naturally occurring weather episode that sees the warm waters of the central Pacific expand eastwards towards North and South America. It was originally recognised by fishermen off the coast of South America in the 1600s with the appearance of unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean. El Nino translates as Little Boy, or Christ Child. The phenomenon, which happens every two to seven years, usually peaks late in the calendar year, although the effects can persist well into the following spring and last up to 12 months. El Nino is part of what is known as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle - the opposite phase of the cycle is called La Nina. La Nina is sometimes referred to as the cold phase and El Nino the warm phase The current El Nino episode is the strongest event since 1998 and is expected to be among the three most powerful ever recorded. According to the WMO, the peak three month average water surface temperatures in tropical Pacific are expected to exceed 2C above normal. Strongest El Nino since 1950 on the way Matt McGrath:'High impacts' from globally stronger El Nino The UK's Department for International Development says (DfID) it is providing emergency support for 2.6 million people and 120,000 malnourished children. It says it will provide 8 million people with food or cash support from January 2016. \"If we fail to act now against this especially powerful El Nino, we will fail vulnerable people across our world,\" UK International Development Minister Nick Hurd said in a statement. \"Ensuring security for those affected by El Nino is important to their countries but also in Britain's national interest. Only by protecting and stabilising vulnerable countries can we ensure people are not forced to leave their homes in search of food or a new livelihood.\" According to the UN, around 60 million people have been forced to leave their homes because of conflict. Aid agencies like Oxfam are worried that the impacts of the continuing El Nino in 2016 will add to existing stresses such as the wars in Syria, South Sudan and Yemen. They say that food shortages are likely to peak in Southern Africa in February with Malawi estimating that almost three million people will require humanitarian assistance before March. Drought and erratic rains have affected two million people across Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua. More floods are expected in Central America in January. \"Millions of people in places like Ethiopia, Haiti and Papua New Guinea are already feeling the effects of drought and crop failure,\" said Jane Cocking, from Oxfam. \"We urgently need to get help to these areas to make sure people have enough food and water. \"We cannot afford to allow other large-scale emergencies to develop elsewhere. If the world waits to respond to emerging crises in southern Africa and Latin America, we will not be able to cope,\" she said. While many parts of the developing world will more directly feel the ongoing impacts of El Nino, the developed world will see impacts on food prices. \"It takes some time for the impacts of El Nino to feed through to social and economic systems,\" said Dr Klingaman. \"Historically food prices have gone up by 5-10 for staples. Crops like coffee and rice and cocoa and sugar tend to be particularly affected.\" The El Nino event is likely to tail off into the spring - but that may not be good news either. El Ninos are often followed by La Nina events, which can have opposite but similarly harmful effects. Scientists say during an El Nino there is a huge transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. Normally, as in 199798, that heat transfer tends to be followed by a cooling of the ocean, a La Nina event, \"It's possible but far from certain that this time next year we could be talking about the reverse of many of these impacts,\" said Dr Klingaman. \"In places where we are seeing droughts from El Nino, we could be seeing flooding from La Nina next year. \"It's just as disruptive, it's just the other way round.\" Follow Matt on Twitter mattmcgrathbbc.",
        "Scientists agree that such attacks are extremely rare - and that sharks are not the man-eaters depicted in Hollywood blockbusters such as Jaws. But they will try to determine why the sharks were lured into shallow waters, and what prompted them to carry out a series of attacks that left one person dead and several more injured. So far, two sharks - an oceanic white tip and a mako shark - have been caught by local fishermen, but experts say there is no evidence so far that either of them are responsible for the attacks. There is an abundance of oceanic white tip sharks - Carcharhinus longimanus - in the Red Sea. Divers have spoken of diving with oceanic white tips without feeling threatened. Sources: International Union for Conservation of Nature and International Shark Attack Files But Ian Fergusson, a shark biologist and patron of the Shark Trust, a UK conservation organisation, said the presence of the short-fin mako shark was intriguing. Oceanic white tips frequent the region but it was unusual for swimmers to encounter them in shallow waters, he said, and it was very rare for shortfin makos to be found in the Red Sea - and exceptionally rare to find them close to shore. He said the last time a short-fin mako attacked in the area was in 1970s, when a tourist was wounded in an attack off Eilat's reefs. Mr Fergusson, a regular visitor to the area, said it would not be difficult for a shark to get close to the shore in Sharm el-Sheikh. \"That particular part of the coastline is bordering on deep water. You don't have to go far offshore to find yourself in 500 metres of water. Sharks can get within half a mile of the shore easily. They don't, for example, have to cross reefs to get there.\" According to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack Files, there are an estimated 70-100 shark attacks on humans per year, resulting in about five to 15 deaths. Of those, the oceanic white tip is responsible for only a small number. But the large oceanic sharks were also the main culprits behind countless attacks on sailors and airmen who, after air and sea battles, found themselves adrift in the Pacific during World War II. So what could have prompted the latest attacks? There has been speculation that animal carcasses were recently dumped into the Red Sea, not far off the shore. Some reports have suggested the remains could have been thrown overboard by a ship carrying animal cargo. \"If you start dumping carcasses, you couldn't ask for a better way of baiting for sharks,\" said Mr Fergusson. David Jacoby, who specialises in shark behavioural ecology at The Marine Biological Association of the UK, agreed that if this is the case, it was likely to be a significant factor in the sharks' behaviour. \"Pelagic, or oceanic, species of shark often feed opportunistically because the open ocean can be a sparse environment for food,\" he said. While less is known about the movements and behaviour of the oceanic white tip, compared with some other species, Mr Jacoby offered another possible explanation as to why the sharks might have been in shallow water. Based on evidence, experts know that in other shark species, larger females move into warmer, shallow waters to either aid gestation - which can be between 9-12 months in white tips depending on the temperature - or to pup, although from what little evidence there is, it seems that oceanic white tips probably pup in the early summer. \"Both species [white tips and makos] rarely encounter people as they spend large amounts of their time in blue water - open ocean,\" said Mr Jacoby. \"Like other species, the oceanic white tip is opportunistic and can be fairly aggressive. It is hard to speculate why they attack but they might if they felt they were threatened. \"They are not coming specifically to attack humans - they are not seen as a food source. But if a white tip or mako felt threatened, felt cornered by lots of people in the water, or next to a reef, for example, it might display more aggressive behaviour as a defence mechanism. \"They are opportunistic and it could just be a case of people being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" Or, he said, they could be cases of mistaken identity - the shark misinterpreting a human for its normal prey. Mr Jacoby said shiny objects in the water could attract attention from sharks - so if the sharks were already in the area, shiny jewellery might be a trigger. There has also been speculation that sharks could have have moved to shallow water because of the depletion of local food sources in the area, but Mr Jacoby disagrees with this. \"This would surely have the opposite effect,\" he said. He explains that sharks adopt search behaviour aiming to maximise their encounters with food sources. Therefore, there is likely to be a relationship between natural prey distributions - fish, squid etc - and shark distributions, as the sharks generally try and go where the food is. However, if a potential food source such as carcasses have been discarded close to shore, some sharks would naturally pick up on this and opportunistically feed there. This would increase the numbers of sharks in the area, making interactions with people more likely. In the past, shark attacks on snorkellers have been blamed on shoddy diving practices such as \"chumming\" - attracting sharks by throwing solid bait or pouring chum, a mash of fish oil and blood, into the water. This type of activity aims to attract sharks such as oceanic white tips, which tend to stay out in the ocean. But Mr Fergusson said he didn't \"buy\" this theory. \"Recent studies in South Africa have shown that chumming has limited effect on shark behaviour. \"This is partly because these sharks are such migratory species, and mainly because this is a Marine National Park, any feeding is prohibited - anyone found doing it would be arrested and jailed.\" He said a more compelling argument could be a continued decline in pelagic fish stocks having an impact on the natural foraging behaviour of certain shark species. While any degradation to the ecosystem of the local reef wouldn't necessarily affect the oceanic white tip because this is outside of its natural habitat, Mr Fergusson said this could \"point to a larger issue of general offshore fishing of tuna and other big fish whittling down and influencing the food chain.\" In Egypt, the hunt is still on for the shark that carried out the latest, fatal attack. Mark Murphy, who runs a scuba diving holiday firm in London, told the BBC that the local authorities would probably aim to have a \"quick clean-up of the area.\" \"There are over four million visitors a year to the Red Sea and there hasn't been a single incident within the last five years,\" said Mr Murphy. \"I am saddened that the Egyptian government has decided to slaughter sharks indiscriminately. Over 70 million sharks a year are killed by humans and they are an essential part of the marine ecosystem.\" In any case, according to US-based shark expert Samuel Gruber, finding the predator or predators would be extremely difficult.",
        "A European Commission spokesman said while progress was made on Sunday, \"significant gaps\" remained. Europe wants Greece to make spending cuts worth EUR2bn (PS1.44bn), to secure a deal that will unlock bailout funds. Greek deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis said that Athens was still ready to negotiate with its lenders. He said Greek government proposals submitted on Sunday had fully covered the fiscal deficit as demanded. However, Mr Dragasakis added that the EU and IMF still wanted Greece to cut pensions - something Athens has said it would never accept. IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said in a blog post that an agreement will require \"difficult decisions,\" with \"tough choices and tough commitments to be made on both sides.\" The cash-strapped nation is trying to agree a funding deal with the European Union and IMF before the end of June to avoid a default. Eurozone finance ministers will discuss Greece when they meet on Thursday. The gathering is regarded as Greece's last chance to strike a deal. The Commission spokesman said: \"President [Jean-Claude] Juncker remains convinced that with stronger reform efforts on the Greek side and political will on all sides, a solution can still be found before the end of the month.\" The talks come as Germany ramps up pressure on Greece. Vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Sunday that European nations were losing patience with Greece. Germany wanted to keep Greece in the eurozone, but writing in Bild he warned that \"not only is time running out, but so too is patience across Europe.\" Mr Gabriel is also economy minister and head of junior coalition partners the Social Democrats. His article is seen as a warning, particularly as his party has been more sympathetic to Greece in the past. \"Everywhere in Europe, the sentiment is growing that enough is enough,\" he wrote. Greece is seeking to avoid defaulting on a EUR1.5bn debt repayment to the IMF due by the end of the month. Creditors have demanded cuts in spending in return for another tranche of bailout funds. But Greece's ruling left-wing Syriza party, led by Alexis Tsipras, was elected in January on promises to ease up on the highly unpopular austerity measures, increase the minimum monthly wage and create more jobs. However, on Saturday Mr Tsipras warned the Greek people to prepare for a \"difficult compromise.\" EUR320bn Greece's debt mountain EUR240bn European bailout EUR56bn Greece owes Germany 177 country's debt-to-GDP ratio 25 fall in GDP since 2010 26 Greek unemployment rate How serious for us is the Greek tragedy?",
        "Four US tourists and an Australian pilot died after their light plane came down on a shopping centre on Tuesday. It had just taken off from the small Essendon Airport, which reopened on Thursday. The nearby shopping centre remains closed \"until further notice.\" Safety officials said they would investigate with \"an open mind\" and make a preliminary report next month. The victims were pilot Max Quartermain and passengers Greg Reynolds De Haven, Russell Munsch, Glenn Garland and John Washburn, four men from Austin, Texas, who were on their way to Tasmania's King Island for a golfing trip. Greg Hood, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), said four investigators would examine the scene for several days. \"We're very much in the gathering of evidence phase,\" he said. Police said the flight appeared to have had a \"catastrophic engine failure\" before Mr Quartermain gave two mayday calls. However, Mr Hood said investigators would make no assumptions. \"We'll look at maintenance records, the history of pilot, the history of aircraft... at this very early stage, we're not going to speculate in relation to any specific part of the investigation,\" he said. The West Australian newspaper reported the Beechcraft B200 King Air plane recently passed a safety check. The inspection by industry regulator Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) found no issues with the plane or pilot, the newspaper said. Mr Quartermain was investigated by the ATSB over a near mid-air collision in September 2015, but he later passed a series of proficiency tests set by CASA. Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews said the crash on Tuesday was state's worst in 30 years.",
        "The ECB cut its deposit rate by the minimum 0.1 percentage point to -0.3, and extended its asset purchase program, but did not increase its monthly government bond purchases. Investors were expecting a bigger cut in the rates, analysts said. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 1.7 to 19,606.32 points. Evan Lucas, market strategist at trading firm IG said Friday's shares sell-off is because there was over-excitement and high expectations for what the ECB would deliver at its policy meeting. \"I have been fully aware that last night's ECB meeting would be the biggest'disappointment' event of the week,\" he wrote in a note. The six month extension of its stimulus program was seen as the bare minimum, because traders were looking for a one-year extension of the plan - or even an open-ended plan. \"What the market'wanted' versus what the market was'going to get' were two distinctly different events,\" Mr Lucas said. Chinese markets followed global markets lower with Shanghai Composite index down 1 to 3,549.51, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.2 to 22,158.57. Australia's SPASX 200 index was down 1.7 to 5,138 despite retail sales rising 0.5 in October from the month before.

        "Tweeters have been using NoToSocialMediaBill to campaign against the proposal. It proposes up to a seven-year sentence or 25,000 (PS16,000) fine for anyone found to be sending \"abusive messages.\" Human Rights Watch condemns the move as an attempt to muzzle free speech. Millions of social media users in Nigeria, as well as those sending text messages, could be affected, it says in a statement. The bill does not define \"abusive statement or messages.\" There will be a public hearing on the bill before it can be passed. Activists see the bill as an attempt to target critics of lawmakers and politicians. The BBC's Nasidi Adamu Yahya in the capital, Abuja, says Nigerian MPs often come under the media spotlight because of the huge money they earn. However, Senator Bala Ibn Na'allah of the governing All Progressive Congress, who sponsored the bill, said the publication of false stories was becoming rampant in the country. \"You can't write false stories just because it is social media,\" he told the BBC Hausa service.

The collection also features photos taken at the Rock Against Racism Carnival at Victoria Park, Hackney, which attracted a crowd of 100,000. The show runs from Friday to 3 September at the Impression Gallery. The Rock Against Racism (RAR) movement formed in response to controversial remarks made by Eric Clapton in 1976. In the following years, RAR staged marches, festivals and more than 500 concerts in the UK in a bid to fight racism through music. Shelton, who studied Fine Art in Leeds and Wakefield, said he became involved with the movement after returning to the UK from America in 1976. He said: \"I was appalled at the state of race relations in Britain, in particular things like the Black and White Minstrel Show and the signs I saw in some windows saying'No Blacks, No Dogs, No Irish'. \"It was a pretty serious situation and I always loved music and very quickly hooked up with the people that had set up RAR. \"It was a bizarre mixture of people, photographers, graphic designers, writers, actors and, of course, musicians. \"We were very lucky in the sense that we tuned in to that explosion of punk and UK reggae and brought the two together. That said more about what RAR was about than any of the slogans we may have shouted from the stage.\" He added: \"I hope the exhibition shows that you can change things and you can actually take a stand, even in the most difficult of situations. \"If it inspires people to be photographers that would be great but I hope it will also inspire people to fight against racism and inequality.\"",

        "Dr Henry McLaughlin believes that physical and mental wellbeing can be improved by a daily mountain climb. The idea is that people climb to the top of Slievemartin outside Rostrevor - known locally as the Cairn - take a selfie and then post the picture on the'Cairnuary' Facebook page. The mountain is 485m high, so Dr McLaughlin said if you climb it 31 times in a month, you've climbed higher than Everest. He said he could see how his patients have benefitted. \"January's a time when I see a lot of depression and this challenge is pretty good for mental health and physical health,\" Dr McLaughlin said. \"A lot of people buy exercise bikes and then they gather dust. So this is something that's free, they get to climb up the mountain every day for a month. \"It's a good hard exercise, it takes them about an hour. \"They don't need exercise bikes and they don't need to join gyms and pay money for stuff, it's out there and they can discover the mountains.\" Those climbing the mountain can chose their own route - which could involve anything up to a 10km hike - or they can use a bike if they want. Dr McLaughlin said between 30 to 50 people were now climbing the mountain daily and all sorts of people are taking part. \"There's one lady who's a patient of mine who's been very ill in the past and has had surgeries to her feet and really shouldn't be able to do it, but she's going from the car park half way up the mountain and she's doing it every day,\" he said. \"There's people with depression doing it - I know it's good for them - people who are overweight doing it, there are people who are very healthy doing it as well. \"People are all very encouraging of each other.\" Dr McLaughlin said he climbed the mountain at about 06:00 GMT on Thursday and had eight other people for company. \"Normally you'd climb the mountain at six o'clock in the morning and you wouldn't see a soul,\" he said. The final climb will be a communal one on Sunday, but Dr McLaughlin said he hoped to come up with something else to keep his patients exercising. \"I'm hoping to follow it on with some sort of challenge for the rest of the year that will keep them doing stuff,\" he said. \"As far as I'm concerned, it's probably doing my work good in that maybe some people are going to get fit that I won't see. \"I'd recommend it to anybody.

        "Shares in the 80-taxpayer-owned bank dropped 3 on the news. RBS boss Ross McEwan said: \"The scale of the bad decisions during that period [the financial crisis] means that some problems are still just emerging.\" RBS said its executive committee would not receive a bonus for 2013, Mr McEwan has waived his bonus for 2013-14. RBS said on Monday the PS3.1bn it planned to set aside would be used to settle claims relating to mortgage products, PPI claims and interest rate hedging. It would allocate: RBS chairman Philip Hampton said: \"RBS did suffer more than most banks in the crisis and these charges today represent an extra clearing-up of the mess that was created in the bank in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008.\" By Robert PestonBusiness editor The announcement of the new provisions came near the end of share dealing in London. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: \"It's an absolutely shocking story that the British taxpayers are still paying for the excesses of this bank in the boom period before it collapsed.\" Ian Gordon, from Investec Securities, said the news was not entirely unexpected, but the amounts involved were. \"Some of this is a pull forward of future bad news and some of this is additional,\" Mr Gordon said. \"Most of the items aren't surprising, but the amounts are at or above the top end of expectations.\" The cumulative amount set aside to cover the mis-selling of PPI, payment protection insurance, alone, is now PS3.1bn, said RBS. RBS, has also, in common with most of its rivals, been fined for fixing the key Libor interest rate and has suspended traders amid an investigation into alleged rigging of the foreign exchange markets. The BBC learned earlier this month that general discussions about bonuses had taken place with shareholders, including UK Financial Investments, the body that manages the government's shareholding in the bank. But, in an interview with the BBC on Monday, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan explained why the most senior executives would not be receiving bonuses this year. \"This is about leadership,\" he said. \"When you look at what we're having to put aside for past activity regarding litigation and conduct, I said to the team,'I am sorry, I just cannot justify the payment of a bonus. He added most of the current leadership had nothing to do with past wrongdoing, but said they needed to \"set the standards.\" But Mr McEwan said that when it came to paying 200 bonuses to attract and keep talented staff, \"We need to make sure that, whatever the market does, we are in a position to follow it. \"We are not the leaders on pay, we just need to stay within touching distance of those we have to compete with to get the talent.\" The controversy over bank bonuses flared up in Parliament earlier this month, with Labour demanding Chancellor George Osborne block any attempt by RBS to pay bonuses of up to double its bankers' annual salary. In 2008, the government bailed out RBS with PS46bn of public funds, and now owns just over 80 of the giant bank. Since then, the bank's share price has tumbled to less than one-third the price the government paid for it. There are questions over whether the government will be able to recoup that money. BBC business editor Robert Peston said that investors and politicians had told him they think it is unlikely taxpayers will get all their money back.",

        "The PM revived a line used during her Tory leadership campaign to respond to claims the two clashed over dinner. She also declined to commit to settling the issue of expats' rights by June. EU sources claim UK misunderstanding of the talks process, and ignorance about how Brussels works, could lead to no deal being agreed on the UK's exit. According to German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine, the prime minister and Mr Juncker clashed last Wednesday at Downing Street over Mrs May's desire to make Brexit \"a success\" and whether the issue of protecting the rights of expat UK and EU nationals could be agreed as early as June. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mrs May said there were a lot of similarities and common ground in the two sides' positions. She added: \"But look, I think what we've seen recently is that at times these negotiations are going to be tough. \"During the Conservative Party leadership campaign I was described by one of my colleagues as a bloody difficult woman. And I said at the time the next person to find that out will be Jean-Claude Juncker.\" The \"bloody difficult\" quote came from former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke, who was recorded discussing her after a TV interview last year. Asked about the German newspaper report, Mrs May said: \"I don't recall the account that has been given of the meeting that took place, I think that a lot of this is Brussels gossip.\" But she said that the talks would be tough and would involve either her or Jeremy Corbyn lining up for the UK against the other 27 EU leaders. Theresa May's comment is revealing about her strength, and also her weakness. No political leader wants to be seen to be pushed around. When the UK talked tough as a member of the EU the others had no choice but to listen. But now the UK is on the way out, the incentives for the others to pay attention - let alone do our bidding - is very different. Refusing to be pushed around is one thing, refusing to show any sign of compromise or listen quite another. Read more from Laura Pressed on whether she did believe the issue of the rights of EU nationals in the UK - and Britons abroad - could be settled in June, she said: \"I've always said that I want this to be an issue that we address at an early stage.\" \"I've always said that there are complexities to this issue and lots of details that will need to be agreed. What people want to know is to have some reassurance about their future. I believe we can give that at an early stage. I've got the will to do this,\" she added. She also said she would have \"no intention of doing anything other\" than serving a full term until 2022 if she wins the 8 June general election.

The four have been charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other things. An online fundraiser for their victim has collected 51,000 (PS42,500) so far. Denying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: \"Where was your sense of decency?\" Prosecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor. Police allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding 300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune. The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt. In a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump. The victim had been dropped off at a McDonalds to meet Mr Hill - who was one of his friends - on 31 December. He was found by a police officer on Tuesday, 3 January, a day after he was reported missing by his parents.

        "Bishop Geoffrey Robinson told a national inquiry the Church had failed to speak out strongly about the abuse. The bishop played an important role in developing the Australian church's response to the issue in the 1990s. Australia is holding a national inquiry into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Popes and archbishops, including the Vatican's finance chief, Australian Cardinal George Pell, had sent out the \"wrong message\" about the issue, Bishop Robinson told the inquiry on Monday. \"I think that some popes gave out the wrong message.... and some archbishops too,\" local media reported Bishop Robinson telling the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Bishop Robinson said Pope John Paul II did not immediately condemn the abuse claims when they emerged in the 1990s. \"We still haven't had that kind of leadership, not even from (Pope) Francis,\" he said, explaining that bishops followed the Vatican's line by remaining silent on the issues. Bishop Robinson said that while he was drafting a national response for the Australian Catholic Church to abuse victims in 1990s, the then Archbishop of Melbourne, Cardinal Pell, released his own protocol for Melbourne. Unlike the national strategy, it required alleged sex abuse victims to speak to church lawyers first. \" (Pell) would later claim that this meant he was the first person in Australia to have such a protocol,\" said Bishop Robinson. \"He destroyed our unity,\" he told the Commission. More than 4,000 victims have come forward to the Royal Commission, which is looking at how religious groups, charities and state care providers responded to child sex abuse allegations.",

Birch has been trying to to find a buyer as owner Eddie Davies wants to sell, with the club PS172.9m in debt. Former Bolton player and assistant manager Phil Brown recalled Gartside taking part in a training session, with a suit on, before the Sherpa Van Trophy final in 1989. \"He just wanted to be part and parcel of a successful club, a successful team,\" Brown, now Southend manager, told BBC Radio 5 live. \"To go from that to become chairman of the club in 1999 and obviously the most successful period the club has ever had, culminating in two great years in Europe.... it was just fantastic for Phil and his family. Today is a very, very sad day for the club.\" Former Trotters captain Kevin Davies, who retired last year, said Gartside was \"really ambitious\" for the club. He said: \"Everyone enjoyed the journey. To be around, he was kind and looked to put his arm around the players.\" Davies said people may have differing opinion about Gartside's legacy but said he and former manager Sam Allardyce had certainly changed \"the direction the club was going in.\" BBC Sport's Simon Stone: Born in Leigh, Gartside was at the helm for one of the most amazing periods in Bolton's long and colourful history. With Eddie Davies providing the funds and Allardyce the managerial expertise, Gartside helped take Bolton into the Premier League in 2001, to the League Cup final in 2004 and Europe twice in three seasons after that. A sixth-place finish in 2004-05 - with a squad that included Jay-Jay Okocha, Ivan Campo and Fernando Hierro - was an incredible effort for a club that could not rely on crowds of 25,000 even when things were going that well. Allardyce's resignation in 2007 proved to be the beginning of the end of the good times for Bolton. Though they retained top-flight status for another four seasons, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 2011, they never finished in the top half again. By 2012, they had gone down, relegated at the end of a desperate season. Allardyce's replacement, Sammy Lee, lasted 14 games. Gary Megson and Owen Coyle could not halt the slide. Dougie Freedman could not secure a play-off berth in Bolton's first season as a Championship club and was replaced by Neil Lennon in October 2014. Despite Davies agreeing to write off the club's debts as he looks for a way out, Bolton's financial situation has been described by Birch as \"critical.\" That is the legacy Gartside has left. Sadly for him, it will be some time before Bolton fans can look past the current mess and remember the glorious nights against Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid that he helped create. Had Gartside got his way, British football could have looked very different. He was a Premier League representative on the Football Association executive board in 2009, when he put forward a proposal for Celtic and Rangers to be allowed to join the English league. The plan was to form a'Premier League Two' as a buffer for clubs - such as Bolton - who were unable to retain their top-flight status. It was never formally discussed because of opposition from Uefa and many other Premier League clubs.",

        "The PS155,000 Bike2Go project was the first of its kind in Scotland and it was hoped it could go into other areas. However, Dumfries and Galloway Council is not including the scheme in a planned regional rollout of initiatives to reduce car journeys. Since its launch in September 2010 the bikes have been hired 2,270 times - a daily average of about two rentals. The scheme was set up to encourage people to get \"out of their cars and onto their bicycles.\" It provides bikes free of charge to subscribers at 11 locations across the town. It is based on similar schemes in Paris, Barcelona, Stockholm and one in London which clocked up one million journeys in its first 10 weeks. The Dumfries project has struggled to increase rental levels since it started. After 10 weeks they averaged about 20-a-week, with winter weather being blamed for the low uptake. The council promised a marketing campaign to encourage increased use of the bikes. A poor summer was again blamed for low uptake in 2012. Plans were then proposed to make the bikes available to all council staff when on business in Dumfries. However, some councillors questioned the value of the scheme which has 171 members on latest figures. One suggested it would have been cheaper to buy them all a bicycle and said the project was \"in danger of becoming an embarrassment.\"",
        "While 7 of people underpay and could be fined, 13 are paying too much. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy tickets that are too expensive for their journey. Train operators said that vending machines were designed for simple ticket requirements. They say plans to simplify fares will help them to give clearer information on ticket machines. The ORR employed mystery shoppers to buy rail tickets from machines. \"Despite investment in new technology and the removal of jargon from ticket machines, our new research shows passengers may be paying more for their journey than necessary,\" said John Larkinson, ORR director of railway markets and economics. \"We are calling on train companies to commit to refund anyone who finds that they could have bought a cheaper ticket for the same journey,\" he added. Rail operators C2C and Scotrail already have a price guarantee in place for when passengers overpay. Earlier this month, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, announced a trial scheme to simplify fares. It said the 16 million fares on offer were \"baffling\" for passengers. As part of the trial, which begins in May, ticket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure they show the cheapest fares available. \"To quickly benefit passengers, the Rail Delivery Group must set out what improvements to ticket machines will be made in the short term,\" said Mr Larkinson. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG, told the BBC that operators were aware that there was a problem with machines, and that they had formulated a 10-point plan to improve them. Yet he pointed out the machines were designed as \"queue-busters\" for passengers with relatively simple requirements, but \"expectations [of passengers] had evolved.\" He said that the system of fares was far too complicated. The RDG also added: \"Complex, decades-old government rail fare regulations make it more difficult for train companies to offer the right, simple options on ticket machines. \"Simplifying the number and types of fares in the system will let train companies provide customers with clear information and help them to make better informed choices,\" they added. by Ben Morris, business reporter In the British Rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis. But in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies (Tocs). The Tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them, as it helps them to keep their trains full. To protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off-peak fares. The result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions. Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets, rather than one through-ticket.",

        "The week-long pre-trial hearing at Guantanamo Bay will largely focus on issues of secrecy. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is accused of masterminding the attacks while the others are implicated for providing support for the co-ordinated hijacking. In May, a chaotic hearing in the case lasted 13 hours. During that hearing, which formally charged the five men, the defendants made defiant outbursts and refused to answer the judge's questions or use the translation system. In addition to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, defendants Ramzi Binalshibh, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Waleed bin Attash are being prosecuted in a special military tribunal for wartime offences known as a military commission. They are charged with conspiring with al-Qaeda, terrorism, and one count of murder for each known victim of the 11 September attacks at the time the charges were filed - 2,976 in total. The five face a possible death penalty sentence if convicted. CIA waterboarding tapes revealed On Monday, the defendants listened calmly and answered the judge's questions, although Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said: \"I don't think there's any justice in this court.\" Defence lawyers argued during the hearing that their clients should not be forced to attend the rest of the week's hearings, because the forcible transport from their high-security cells may remind them of their time at secret CIA prisons. Before their transfer to the US base at Guantanamo Bay in 2006, the defendants were held for years in secret CIA prisons. All five have said they were tortured during interrogations. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was repeatedly water-boarded before being brought to Guantanamo. \"We have to talk about torture,\" Air Force Captain Michael Schwartz, a defence lawyer, said on Monday. But Judge James Pohl said the issue was not relevant at this stage. Prosecution lawyers have said the use of waterboarding and similar methods could be relevant when determining whether prisoners' statements were voluntarily given. The court is also expected to hear a defence request to abolish what they term a \"presumptive classification\" that treats any discussion of the CIA prisons as top secret, as well as a media request to limit closing of the courtroom for secret sessions. Judge Pohl ultimately ruled that the defendants would not be forced to attend hearings scheduled to run through the end of this week, but did not rule out further pre-trial hearings. He said all would have to be present for their trial, which is not likely to start for more than a year.",
        "A referendum on the UK's membership of the EU is to be held later this year. The survey indicates that only 11 of of the chamber's members in Northern Ireland support a British exit (Brexit). That compares to 30 of those surveyed in the rest of the UK. The Chamber of Commerce has about 1,200 members in Northern Ireland. About 250 of those responded to the poll. More than half of the respondents (60) said that Prime Minister David Cameron's renegotiated EU deal is unlikely to change how they will vote. The results come on the eve of crunch Brussels talks, which are expected to result in a deal. Eighty-four per cent of those surveyed in Northern Ireland also say that there has been no impact on their sales and orders as of yet, due to the uncertainty of Britain's future within the EU. Commenting on the results, President of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce Stephen McCully said the findings suggest that \"the renegotiation is having little impact on day-to-day business - or the vote of the business community.\" He said that this was because many made up their minds before knowing the outcome of negotiations, effectively discounting them as irrelevant. \"For businesspeople, this is a question of in or out,\" he said. \"Those within Northern Ireland who are firmly wedded to the EU have said that Brexit will leave us stranded outside the EU, and coping with the re-emergence of a land border with the Republic of Ireland. \"Emotion has a part in all decision making and it will do so here, but there is a duty to ensure decisions are as well informed as they can be.\" Clarification: An earlier version of this article omitted the number of respondents to the Chamber of Commerce survey.",
        "NHS Tayside had the highest number followed by NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. The figures also revealed that more than 560,000 people missed at least one NHS outpatient appointment in 201415. Each missed appointment is thought to cost the NHS PS120, putting the total cost to the health service at PS100m. The figures were obtained by the Scottish Conservatives through a Freedom of Information request. The statistics revealed: The Scottish Tories have previously suggested those who fail to show for appointments on a certain number of occasions could face some sanction from the health board. The party has also urged the Scottish government look at more innovative ways of reminding patients to turn up at appointments. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: \"Missing a hospital appointment can happen to anyone, and for a range of reasons. \"But when you're getting to the point where you are missing five or more in the space of just a year, something really has to be done. \"That is costing the NHS thousands of pounds, wreaking havoc with hospital planning, and of course potentially harming the health of the patient involved. \"We've been critical of the NHS in the past for cancelling appointments and procedures, so it's only fair we do everything we can to make sure patient no-shows are limited too. \"We need to find ways to ensure people turn up at the appointments that are made and stop showing contempt for our NHS, doctors and nursing staff.\" Health Secretary Shona Robison said the percentage of patients missing appointments has decreased slightly over the last five years. She added: \"However, it is important that all health boards understand why patients are not attending appointments and look at ways to reduce this. \"The Scottish government is committed to supporting health boards to deliver secure messaging services, including reminders. \"Health Scotland also recently published a report looking at those who did not attend appointments over a 10 year period from 200203 to 201112. \"We welcome this report which will provide boards with further learning on the issue of non-attendance.\"",

Ward was given five years and two months, Hiley five years. The pair pleaded guilty to possession, supply and importation of Class A and Class B drugs. Peter Ward was known online as PlutoPete. His business specialised in supplying military-grade foil packaging that claimed to hide illegal materials from detection. He also provided new psychoactive substances, commonly known as legal highs. He was arrested by National Crime Agency officers in Barnstaple in October 2013 following an international operation targeting prominent vendors on dark web marketplaces like Silk Road. Officers searched Ward's rural home and found class A and B drugs and numerous computers. Analysis uncovered his close working with an ex-customer, Richard Hiley, who was commissioned by Ward to convert bitcoins into cash. In December 2013, NCA officers raided Hiley's address in the West Midlands after financial records seized from Ward identified large scale transactions between the pair. Hiley also pleaded guilty to two counts of importing a prohibited weapon after he imported five stun guns. He said they were for personal protection.

        "She outlined her concerns about the consequences of the Brexit vote in a letter to Theresa May on Wednesday. Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness highlighted five key priorities to the prime minister. On Thursday, Mrs Foster said: \"Brexit means Brexit, but that doesn't mean that we close our eyes to the challenges that are there.\" She emphasised that Northern Ireland's border must not become a catalyst for illegal activity, nor create an incentive for those who wished to undermine the peace process. \"In the past, terrorists have used the border as a way of evading justice and that can not be the case in the future,\" she said. \"We need to make sure that we have strong mechanisms in place to make sure that they don't get away with that sort of activity.\" In their letter, the first and deputy first ministers highlighted to Mrs May that Northern Ireland was unique as the only part of the UK that has a border with an EU member state. They also referred to costs, the energy market, drawdown of EU funding and treatment of the agri-food sector as other priorities. During the referendum, Mrs Foster's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) campaigned in favour of Brexit, while Martin McGuinness's Sinn Fein wanted to stay in the EU. When it comes to the economy, they said they wanted to \"retain as far as possible the ease with which we currently trade with EU member states.\" \"It would be negligent of me not to point out where I believe the challenges are,\" Mrs Foster said. \"We're extracting ourselves from European Union and it is of course right that we identify where those challenges lie, but I fundamentally believe that there are huge opportunities.\" Speaking on Thursday, Mr McGuinness said the letter was \"a very important indication\" that he and Mrs Foster \"recognise our huge responsibility to the people we represent.\" \"I think we would've done a grave disservice if we hadn't articulated the differences and challenges we might face in times ahead,\" he said. \"This is about how we protect the interests of the people we represent and the challenges that lie ahead.\" He added that it was important the he and the first minister \"come together in the aftermath of the vote\" in spite of having been on different sides of the referendum debate. \"My gripe isn't with Arlene Foster, my gripe is with David Cameron who called the referendum in the first place,\" he said. \"This is too big, too serious for us not to be joined up in relation to how we take this process forward.\" Stormont's opposition parties criticised the letter, with the Ulster Unionist Party's (UUP) economy spokesperson Steve Aiken asking \"whether this is a DUP u-turn on their position on the referendum.\" Mrs Foster replied that the UUP's position on Brexit had been \"comical.\" She added: \"Poor Steven Aiken has been sent out once again to be the attack dog against the executive, and frankly he comes across more as a Chihuahua.\" However, the SDLP's Claire Hanna said: \"The first minister has serious questions to answer over the breathtaking reverse ferret she is currently performing. \"Ms Foster has clearly realised the error of her ways in backing Brexit, and now the horse has bolted is asking the Conservative government to close the gate.\" While the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU by 52 to 48, 56 of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.",

Many of our social media marketing successes have been around amplifying amazing user-generated content rather than creating specific assets, because that is where the powerful stories are. For example, promoting tips from The Source - our site designed to help us reach friends, colleagues, neighbours who may want to help someone with cancer but don't necessarily know what to do or say - has been a powerful way to reach new audiences.\" Dr Jonathan Deacon, reader in marketing and entrepreneurship at University of South Wales, UniSouthWales: \"No, like a lot of things in life the more cash you throw at something does not mean that it will get better. Social media is about three key things in my mind. Who you want to talk with, what you want to say and what you want them to do once you have said it. \"Firstly, do you know your audience? Not just bland agglomerations of'people' but an in-depth understanding of the individuals that make up an audience. What type of content do they readshare and why? How is it written? \"Secondly, what do you want to say to this audience? What are you trying to achieve? Writing content is critical. Will the content that you share have meaning to the audience you want to communicate with and will they respond? \"And thirdly, do you want someone to share your content, act upon it or perhaps just be amused by it? \"If you take a closer look at these three things you will probably see that small firms are just as able as large firms to achieve a meaningful outcome with social media. I always think that small firms are better able as they have an intimate knowledge of the audience - they may even be part of the audience themselves.\" Andrew Grill, global partner social business at IBM, AndrewGrill: \"Just as 12 years or so ago when the internet first appeared, smaller companies that took advantage of this new tool could appear much larger than existing companies. \"With social media, even the smallest company can have a global presence. I've seen companies of all sizes become successful with social media because they take the time to understand the language of social and engage authentically with their customers and fans. \"My tip is don't treat social as a marketing channel, treat it as a conversation you would have with someone at the conference. You need to have something of value to exchange with your audience and not just interrupt a conversation. \"I often challenge conference participants to go up to two other people at a networking break and see how long it takes to be invited into the conversation. If by listening closely you see where what you might say will add real value to the conversation, you will be welcomed in. If you just want to sell something you will be waved away. This is the same with social.\" People are already saying,'ads are spoiling my social media experience' - are there lessons for brandsbusinesses to learn? JW: \"A big learning for brands is that just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Even with all this new technology, not a lot has really changed and the basic principles of marketing remain - understand your customers, what they want and when they want it. Online marketing is all about the right time, right place and right message. If it doesn't deliver on this, it could have a negative impact on your brand.\" AM: \"I think relevance is the key here. We as brands have access to so much data about our customers these days and it's important we use that when making marketing decisions. Personalised ads then have the capacity to become more useful additions to our customers' experience rather than intrusive.\" JD: \"Yes, if the audience is dissatisfied with the content then you should listen and do something else. Social media is just that, social and therefore conversational, informal and individualistic. Advertising belongs in the age of mass market and mass communication - in the past.\" AG: \"As I will explain during my Oi keynote [speech], social media is just like real life. My fear is that many companies see social as just'another channel' and they try and push products on to people without understanding that they are interrupting existing conversations. We may never get away from'ads' of some form. However, with social now being such a powerful tool, companies cannot simply reformat a marketing message for a social network. The lessons to learn are that companies that choose to engage with consumers and fans rather than advertise to them will be more successful in the longer term in my opinion.\" What's the best example of a good campaign on social media you've seen recently? JW: \"Each year Adobe runs a digital marketing summit in the US and here in EMEA. While we work really hard to put together a great physical event, we make sure the experience starts long before and after the summit has taken place through our social channels. It's a great example of how a traditional marketing channel has been given a new lease of life through digital technology.\" JD: \"For the very best execution of how to use social media take a look at Hiut Denim. They understand their audience, what they are trying to say and what they want people to do.\" AG: \"Too many to choose from - but those that work across multiple platforms with a credible call to action get my attention.\" What's your favourite social media and how often do you use it? JW: \"Twitter is the first thing I fire up when I get up in the morning. I probably use it every hour for news and sharing content I find interesting with my network.\" AM: \"I still use Twitter a lot, mostly listening to keep up on what's new in digital (and the world) but I do try and tweet something useful at least once a day.\" JD: \"LinkedIn - every day.\" AG: \"Twitter! I wouldn't be at the Oi conference without Twitter - famously my \"one tweet\" in January 2011 lead me to working for IBM. I tweet whenever I have some downtime, in between meetings or walking home.\" When you eat, is your phonetablet switched off? JW: \"When I'm on my own, no. When I'm with my family, yes. It's a rule to never bring our phones to the table.\" AM: \"Nope I tend to be always connected - though I don't take photos of my food.\" JD: \"Mine is, but my wife keeps hers on, although she only answers once we have eaten.\" AG: \"SocialNeverSleeps\" What's the last non-work related app you downloaded? JW: \"This was the new Apple watch game'Rules!' I'm expecting my new wearable to arrive anytime soon.\" AM: \"My Apple watch has just been delivered so I'm spending quite a bit of time right now playing with all the apps I can have on it.\" JD: \"A tilt-shift photo app which makes everything in your photos look miniature - very clever.\" AG: \"WhatsApp - I'm one of the 700 million people sending 30 billion WhatsApps each day.\" What's the next big thing? JW: \"One of the problems with social has long been proving its ROI (return on investment). We are now starting to think of social as a data-driven science, which is a great first step in helping to prove its value and starting to have meaningful conversations with other data-driven marketing teams.\" AM: \"Data! I'm genuinely excited about data, or rather ways of using it. I think that we need to really develop the ways that we use all the data available to us to personalise customer experience across digital channels. Whether that's gathered from our social activity or newer areas like ibeacons or wearables, we can gather so much valuable data to make online experiences more impactful. Making connections between our online social interactions and all the offline data we're gathering about our lives will enable truly personalised, useful and interesting digital experiences.\" JD: \"I see a lot of developments around'EdTech' and I'm pretty sure that some of that will be successful when taken to market. I also think that the very smart and probably small firms will begin to better integrate social media with personalised communication. I can foresee firms mixing high-end social media with low-end hard copy, with great effect. For example, Twitter feeds backed up with occasional and highly personalised written letters, cards and the like - authoritative and authentic.\" AG: \"Corporate Social Networks - we've only just scratched the surface of how companies can collaborate using social techniques and allow employees to be more productive, and more satisfied at work because they can share in the corporate wisdom of hundreds and even thousands of colleagues around the world. While this will be huge, it requires a massive cultural change, and will become the NewWayToWork. This is something that clients are keeping me and my team at IBM very busy.\"",
        "Dale Merza, 20, is charged with misdemeanour hazing after the alleged attack last October on Andrew Seely, 19, at Central Michigan University. Mr Seely, who was sleeping at the time of the incident, sought medical treatment for serous facial swelling. The accused could get 93 days in jail and a 1,000 (PS800) fine if convicted. Mr Merza's legal representative told the Detroit Free Press his client, who was charged on Friday in Isabella County District Court, was innocent. \"This case has been blown way out of proportion by the individual's family members, who were not present and don't have any of the facts,\" lawyer Bruce Leach told the newspaper. It is an induction ritual meted out typically to new members of the US college men and women's social clubs known as fraternities and sororities, but also to military recruits. The practice can include physical violence, sexual coercion, forced alcohol consumption, or degrading and dangerous \"pranks\" such as forcing people to eat vile food mixtures or consume large amounts of water. It is illegal in most US states, amounting usually to a misdemeanour charge, unless there are serious injuries. There has been a nationwide crackdown on hazing after high-profile deaths including that of Florida AM University drumming student Robert Champion. Why is hazing so common? Mr Seely was targeted at an off-campus fraternity house, Alpha Chi Rho, which was sanctioned in 2011 for hazing incidents. His mother, Teresa Seely, wrote about the alleged hazing in a viral Facebook post in March, saying: \"He could have been killed.\" The accounting student only told his family what had happened months afterwards. He blamed the incident for his decision to leave the college. The teenager's father, Paul Seely, told CBS News his son could have been killed if the peanut butter had entered his mouth. The Seely family said their son had made known to other members of the fraternity that he had a severe peanut allergy, for which he carries medication. The National Fraternity of Alphi Chi Rho condemned the incident, saying it did not condone such behaviour. \"Alpha Chi Rho is appalled and upset by the actions taken by individuals against Andrew Seely,\" said its statement.",

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said: \"I'm sure everybody who values his work will send best wishes to Martin, Bernie and their family. \"I met Martin as normal at Stormont on Monday. I have been in regular contact with him since and he is totally committed to fulfilling his duties.\"",
        "Mr Corbyn told the BBC Labour would consider the question \"as a party.\" Ministers have been talking to Labour MPs to try to persuade them to back intervention ahead of a Commons vote expected by Christmas. Mr Corbyn is against military action, but a number of his MPs support it and may rebel if ordered to vote against. On his first visit to Wales as party leader, Mr Corbyn said the priority should be a political settlement in the war-torn country, in order to \"isolate\" so-called Islamic State. Asked whether he would allow his MPs a free vote - which means they would not have to follow the chosen party line - he said: \"No, we would have to consider it as a party, consider it as a group and decide how we would react at that point, I can't predict at this stage.\" Events in Syria are \"beyond appalling\" he said, adding that \"there has to be a political solution - all wars end with a political solution.\" Prime Minister David Cameron has dismissed suggestions a UN resolution - which Labour is calling for - would be needed before the UK takes action in Syria. MPs rejected air strikes on Syria in 2013, when the target was President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, but later approved British participation in air strikes against Islamic State extremists in Iraq. The BBC has been told ministers are increasingly confident they will have the numbers to secure Commons backing to extend the campaign into Syria. Mr Cameron has said he will set out a detailed case for intervention and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is planning to brief Labour MPs collectively at an open meeting. Some Labour MPs have already said they will refuse to vote with Mr Corbyn if ordered to oppose air strikes.",
        "According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men. Given such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed \"the Cinderella cancer.\" \"We just don't make enough of it\" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. \"On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked.\" Based at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered. \"What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity. And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour.\" But if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage? That - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological GeneEnvironment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer. The results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer. \"It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer,\" says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. \"That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years.\" If that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery. Sitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive. As with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum. \"The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery\" says Prof Neal. \"It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient.\"",
        "The 32-year-old had been in poor form but made a double century to inspire his side's fightback after England made 629-6 declared in Cape Town. \"I believe I can be of greater value as a fully focused batsman and senior player at this time,\" said Amla. AB de Villiers will lead South Africa in the third Test in Johannesburg, which starts on 14 January. After his appointment as successor to Graeme Smith in June 2014, Amla captained the world number one side in 14 Tests. He won four and drew six but came under pressure during a 3-0 series defeat in India. Amla said he had considered quitting before the start of the series against England, who won the first Test by 241 runs in Durban last week. Until his marathon effort at Newlands, Amla, a veteran of 90 Tests and 7,108 runs, had not hit a Test century since December 2014. \"I honestly feel a lot of the criticism that Hashim has faced in the last couple of weeks is very harsh,\" said South Africa coach Russell Domingo. \"He is one of South Africa's greatest players. There hasn't been enough respect shown of his achievements as a player.\" De Villiers had raised doubts about his future in Test cricket during the first Test because of his busy workload, and handed over wicketkeeping duties to Quinton de Kock for the second match. The 31-year-old, who already leads the one-day side, said: \"It is an incredible honour to captain South Africa in any format. The captaincy has obviously come at short notice and is the realisation of a lifelong dream. \"At the moment my priority and focus is placed on leading this team to what can be a memorable series win against England. This Test squad is motivated and determined to turn our performances around and I'm looking forward to taking up that challenge as captain.\" England captain Alastair Cook was sad to learn of Amla's resignation. \"You're under pressure as a captain for a lot of the time,\" said Cook. \"It's always sad when someone steps down because to captain your country is a huge honour and a real privilege. \"He'll have his reasons and I wish him all the best - he's a really nice guy.\" Cricket South Africa chief executive Haroon Lorgat said Amla \"still had a huge role to play in shaping the success of our team.\" He added: \"He is just that type of a person and we are very fortunate to have him in our stable. \"I want to thank AB for readily accepting the challenge of rebuilding our Test team as we seek to remain the best team in the world.\"",
        "The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says young people are gambling with their health by using prescription medicines in a bid to get higher marks in exams. Many websites illegally sell drugs like Ritalin and Modafinil without a valid prescription. The drugs can cause dependency, heart problems and psychosis. So far this year, the MHRA has closed nearly 5,000 websites selling fake or unlicensed medicines. Modafinil is designed to be used for a health condition called narcolepsy - a rare but serious brain disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times. But some students take it to stay alert. Others take Ritalin, a treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), for a cognitive boost. MHRA Senior Policy Manager Lynda Scammell said: \"You may be offered'smart drugs' or'cognitive enhancers' at university - some of them may be potent medicines which should only be prescribed by a doctor. \"Modafinil is licensed for specific medical conditions - not for use as a'boost' during exams. Don't put your health at risk by self-medication - it could have serious side-effects. \"It's a criminal offence to supply prescription-only medicines without a valid prescription - websites offering them are acting illegally. \"Be smart - don't put your health at risk by buying medicines online and don't give your student loan to a criminal.\"",

        "The 36-year-old former assistant coach at St Mirren and Cowdenbeath has helped Michael O'Neill steer his fifth seeds to a place in the finals in France. \"It makes me proud, but I'm also disappointed Scotland didn't qualify,\" Macphee told BBC Scotland. \"We're the first team from pot five to win a group.\" Macphee had an unremarkable playing career, with spells at East Fife, Forfar Athletic and Queen's Park before he embarked on a footballing scholarship in the United States. His playing career took him to Romania with Braila and Japan with Kariya before turning to management and leading Cupar Hearts to the Scottish Amateur Cup final in 2007. Macphee then worked with Danny Lennon at Cowdenbeath and St Mirren, where he helped the club win the League Cup. \"That season, we made a strong start to the league then beating Celtic in the cup semi-final at Hampden was fantastic and going on to lift the Cup against Hearts,\" he said. Northern Ireland manager O'Neill was impressed by Macphee's performance analysis work in Paisley and soon brought him into the international set-up. \"Unless you're a Barcelona, a Real Madrid, or a Manchester United, where you can quite simply have your own playing identity because you know your players are better than the opponent, there is an element there you can disregard the opponent,\" he said. Media playback is not supported on this device \"I know from conversations with Jonny Evans, Alex Ferguson - apart from the Champions League - didn't pay any attention to the opponent. \"He filled the players with belief that'Manchester United play this way and we are better'. At the biggest clubs in the world, you can play this way. \"St Mirren are clearly not one of them and Michael learned from speaking to players and other managers about my work.\" While Scotland will be watching from home next summer, Northern Ireland won their group ahead of Romania, Hungary, Greece, Finland and the Faroe Islands despite a limited group of players to pick from. Among their squad are players from the likes of Fleetwood Town and Doncaster Rovers, while seven players are currently playing in Scottish football. \"I don't think it's necessarily a surprise that Michael O'Neill has managed to turn Northern Ireland around,\" said Macphee, who also scouted for Mexico at last year's World Cup in Brazil. \"I think a lot of people don't know what he achieved with Shamrock Rovers. \"He managed to win the league twice there, but the most remarkable achievement there for Michael - he took them into the Europa League. \"He did that with players on 42-week contracts. That's basically part-time footballers he's taken into the group stage. \"I know from discussing with him the budget was only about PS450,000, which to give you idea of scale is half that of any Scottish top-flight club.\" Macphee, who runs sport tours and football academy businesses, added: \"It's not a case of managing expectations. \"We've already achieved something which people will see as remarkable. \"The team spirit in the group of players is unbelievable. \"The humility from the top players like Jonny Evans and Steven Davis, just because of the gulf in what the players earn, everybody's equal and we will keep that unity between staff and players.\"",
        "Ex-BBC journalist Jacky Sutton, 50, was found dead in a toilet at the city's Ataturk airport between 17-18 October. She was the acting Iraq director for the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) and was travelling from London to Irbil, northern Iraq. In a statement Jenny Sutton, Ms Sutton's sister, said \"at this stage we believe that Jacky acted alone.\" But the statement added that there remained \"the possibility that additional information will come to light.\" An investigation into the death is currently being carried out by Turkish authorities. The statement said the family and the IWPR had carried out an \"extensive review\" of information provided by Turkish authorities. Jenny Sutton said: \"The family is satisfied with the investigation undertaken by the Turkish authorities. \"We were deeply sceptical about initial reports. But based on the evidence we have seen, at this stage we believe that Jacky acted alone.\" The family and the IWPR said the Turkish authorities had provided access to \"the complete dossier of evidence\" relating to the case, including copies of CCTV images from the airport and witness statements. This all indicated that Ms Sutton had been alone and there was no evidence of a struggle, they said. The decision to release information from the investigation had followed \"widespread speculation\" about the circumstances surrounding Ms Sutton's death, the statement added. The IWPR and the family said they would seek a further assessment from an independent investigative expert to confirm the findings once the Turkish investigation was complete. The London-based IWPR supports local journalism in countries affected by conflict and crisis. Its previous Iraq director, Ammar Al Shahbander, was killed in a car bomb attack in Baghdad on 2 May and a memorial service had been held for him in London last week, according to the IWPR website. Ms Sutton had been in London attending the service. Ms Sutton worked for the BBC World Service between 1998 and 2000, reporting from Africa, the Middle East and London. She also served in senior roles at the United Nations. The IWPR described Ms Sutton as \"extremely bright\" and \"universally loved.\"",
        "One year on, the first handball matches since the Olympic Games have taken place inside the venue - reborn as a sports centre for the community - and on its hallowed London 2012 floor tiles. Handball will be a regular feature here. If you missed it at London 2012, handball is played on an indoor court between two teams of seven players. To simplify things greatly, you use your hands to throw the ball into the opposing team's goal. For handball's dedicated British fans, getting back in the Box at the Olympic Park has been a rare thrill. \"We're in our Wembley,\" says Paul Stewart, who plays for Ruislip Eagles and took part in one of Sunday's inaugural games. \"This is the pinnacle. You don't get to play in the biggest sports stadiums in football unless you're a pro. Every so often I look up from what looks like a gym floor and see these banks of seats, and remember - I'm in the Copper Box! Wow! \"I can see the seat I sat in at the Olympics.\" Stewart was not a handball player this time 12 months ago, but he traded some water polo tickets with friends for the chance to see the sport and a love affair was born. \"We saw a double header in the group stage, Croatia-Spain and France-Sweden. The wow factor was there, watching these amazing goalkeepers. \"I went to my first session at the end of August last year, intending to be a goalkeeper, and the buzz was amazing. \"I remember getting home that evening and thinking:'That was so much better than I'd imagined.' I was thinking I'd come home bruised or not even bruised because I hadn't touched the ball.... but it was so much fun.\" For Dani Sposi, setting foot inside the Copper Box is bittersweet. A former member of the British handball team, she narrowly missed out on selection for London 2012. \"During preparations for the Games we used to go there once a month,\" she remembers. \"When I got there, I remembered the smell, all those times we used to train there. \"Being there as a player after the Olympics was a bit emotional, because I wasn't selected and it was very hard to go through all that disappointment. \"I had my six-year-old son, Matteo, with me. He said:'Mum, why didn't you play at the Olympics?' I said:'Well, the coach made a different decision, so mummy didn't play.' Dani Sposi: \"We had loads of people coming into the Copper Box on Sunday and asking about handball. We had another area in the arena where we could explain what handball is all about and let them shoot at goal. \"Sometimes people don't realise how hard handball is. Even the parents are like'oh, I'll do it' - and then'oh, this is hard!' You have to find the right co-ordination with the three steps and the bounce.\" Paul Stewart: \"We had easily hundreds, probably a couple of thousand people all told. There were points when it was massively busy, queues of parents with children all holding a ball waiting to have a go. It was superb. \"At league level, for the next year or so, it's going to be massive. If we get the right publicity, if people can see the sport and know it's still carrying on in the Olympic venue, that might drag them in across the country.\" \"He has been with me the whole journey, since he was eight months old - all the training sessions, travelling around. It was very good for him to be there, to go inside the Olympic arena. Even during training, I never had the chance to bring him in.\" Sposi's dream of an Olympic appearance for Great Britain has ended, but other players in the Box still aspire to fly the British flag - despite a critical shortage of funding leaving GB's elite teams in limbo. \"Playing in the Olympic venue was a proud moment,\" says Gil Lewis, another who only started playing after London 2012. Lewis already has two university team-mates who have been selected for the England Under-20 squad within a year of taking up the sport; he himself was chosen to play for the British universities team, but their trip to a tournament in the Netherlands fell apart when the travel proved too expensive. A shortage of cash is a feature of life as a handball player in Britain, but Lewis is determined not to let it dampen his enthusiasm. \"This year I've been invited to move up to the first team; I was in shock when I was first asked. They've asked if I want to go to the Challenge Cup, playing in Bulgaria, and that would be an amazing experience,\" he says. \"That all has to be funded through ourselves and it's a lot of personal expense to play. But an opportunity to play in a European competition? You don't want to miss out because you didn't save up enough.\" British teams competed at London 2012 by virtue of being the Olympic hosts. In future, they will have to qualify for the Games on merit, which is a big ask of a fledgling sport, but Lewis is determined to take the sport as far as he can. \"If a GB team is still around in the next few years, to be able to play for them would be fantastic,\" he says. \"If you'd told me a year ago, I'd never have imagined I'd be anywhere close to being able to represent my country. \"There will be a few years before I'm near that standard and with all the work being done at grassroots, by that time hopefully the standard will have improved enough to warrant some kind of funding - to at least put some form of team out.\" Stewart adds: \"Outside the obvious problem with elite funding, we're in a very strong position to drive growth at youth level. \"At Ruislip, we're working hard to get together a full youth structure, plus I'm talking to local schools and colleges and we've got a tie-in with Brunel University. \"If we can get people into the sport, who knows what we can achieve?\"",
        "Silverwood's side head the Division One table by 41 points with five games remaining, the first of them at home to Somerset starting on Monday. Only Notts, in 2005, have won the title following promotion the previous year. \"In our first year back up in Division One, to bring it home would be pretty special.\" Silverwood told BBC Essex. Essex lifted the trophy six times in the days of a single-division Championship, most recently in 1992 when Graham Gooch was captain. Now, current skipper Ryan ten Doeschate has the task to leading the team to their first silverware of any kind for seven years following the end of their involvement in this summer's T20 Blast. Only two of Essex's last five matches are at home, and they will have to manage without England batsmen Alastair Cook and Tom Westley, their two leading run-scorers in the Championship, because of the current Test series against West Indies. \"We are in a great position, but there's still a lot of work to be done and we won't take anything for granted,\" said Silverwood. \"We have got five games of Championship cricket left and we can look at them with a lot of excitement. We'll go out there and give every ounce of energy, blood sweat and tears. \"It's the holy grail, and certainly in our dressing room and among the members, although it's great to win (other) competitions, we want to bring that one home.\"",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device The Irish were 17-0 down inside the opening 13 minutes in Cardiff and went on to lose heavily 43-20. \"We just did not get the start that we needed, particularly with a group low on experience,\" said Schmidt. \"The confidence got dented a little bit but I was incredibly proud of the way they fought their way back.\" Media playback is not supported on this device They went into the match without influential performers Paul O'Connell, Johnny Sexton, Peter O'Mahony, Sean O'Brien and Jared Payne - and got off to a terrible start by conceding a third-minute try. A second try and penalty followed before Ireland got themselves on the scoreboard. Ireland summoned up a big effort after half-time as Jordi Murphy's try helped cut the margin to only three points before Ian Madigan missed a long-range penalty that would have levelled the game. \"We had a kick which could have drawn us level and might have allowed us to kick on,\" Schmidt added. \"It wasn't to be and really when you try a little too hard at the end you get loose and, with the speed merchants Argentina have, they finished off another couple of tries and that exacerbated things. \"It reflected the tour de force we have seen demonstrated by the southern hemisphere teams. \"We were desperate not to be part of what happened in Saturday's matches.\" Ireland skipper Jamie Heaslip: \"We are obviously very disappointed to lose in such a big game. \"We didn't help ourselves at the start but we fought back, we came back in it, but we gave ourselves too much to do at the start. \"Argentina played a very expansive game, they stretched us and they took their scores when they got them. \"We got it back to three points and they took their opportunities again to kick on, and we just could not take our opportunities.\" Argentina's Juan Imhoff: \"It was a tough game, we worked a lot to get this victory. \"We will enjoy this, but next week we will have another tough game. \"We are a really good team in offence, we attack very well, but today we had a defence to make the difference.\"",
        "City are fourth in the league following defeat at Chelsea on Wednesday, all but ending hopes of a league title in the Catalan's debut campaign in England. \"In future I will be better - definitely,\" said the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach. \"This season has been a massive lesson for me.\" He added: \"We have a lot of beautiful things to fight for and to qualify for the Champions League will be a huge success. But we have to be honest with ourselves. We were not good enough to compete for the Premier League [title].\" Defeat at Stamford Bridge left City just four points ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, both of whom have a game in hand. With the FA Cup being City's only realistic chance of winning a trophy this term, it is likely to be the worst season of Guardiola's managerial career. The 46-year-old has never gone a single season without winning a trophy - he has won the title in six out of seven attempts and his sides have always reached the last four of the Champions League. Guardiola has also responded to questions about a row between City and Chelsea coaching staff at Stamford Bridge following the defeat on Wednesday night. There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win. The incident centred around a disagreement between Chelsea fitness coach Paolo Bertelli and Manchester City masseur Mark Sertori, both of whom speak Italian, as the Premier League leaders celebrated their victory. Guardiola said: \"We are so polite in our defeats and we are so polite when we win. When we win, normally we celebrate a little bit, then we go to the locker room. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was not involved and has played the incident down. He said: \"Respect is the most important thing in football.\"",
        "Speaking to Huw Edwards on The Wales Report, Andrew RT Davies defended his party from criticism that it simply opposes Labour policies rather than putting forward its own programme for government. \"At every juncture we bring forward an alternative, we don't just criticise,\" he said. \"There is a clear agenda for what the Welsh Conservatives stand for, and it's action. \"It's action to improve the economy, it's action to improve public services in Wales and it's action to strengthen communities the length and breadth of Wales.\" Asked about his priority if the Tories won power after the assembly election in May, Mr Davies said: \"The first spending commitment is protecting the NHS budget for the lifetime of this parliament, or the assembly's term, the five years. \"I would suggest that the outcomes in Wales regrettably aren't as good as we want them to be. \"And we want to make sure those outcomes are improved. \"That's why we've called for an independent Keogh-style enquiry into the NHS here in Wales so we can make those improvements, not on political whims, but led by clinicians themselves telling us what we need to be doing to improve the health service here in Wales.\" Prof Sir Bruce Keogh investigated 14 NHS trusts in England for a review into higher-than-expected hospital death rates, published in 2013. Speaking about the Wales Bill on further devolution, the Welsh Conservative leader praised Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb's handling of the legislation, put on hold on Monday after MPs called for a re-think. It followed claims that the draft bill was confusing, and would leave Welsh ministers with fewer powers rather than more. Mr Davies said: \"The secretary of state deserves huge credit; for instead of ploughing on with this bill, actually saying'I've listened to what people have said to me'. \"Actually, the Welsh Labour government could learn a lot from this legislative process.\" First Minister Carwyn Jones had called Monday's announcement on the Wales Bill an \"avoidable delay to clear up an avoidable mess.\"",

        "Clotilde Nonnez, a 56-year-old yoga teacher, says she has lived in the capital for 30 years and seen her health deteriorate. However, it became worse than ever when pollution in Paris hit record levels last December. Her lawyer says air pollution is causing 48,000 French deaths per year. \"We are taking the state to task because we think the medical problems that pollution victims suffer are as a result of the authorities' lack of action in tackling air pollution,\" Francois Lafforgue told Le Monde newspaper. More cases would be brought in the coming weeks, in Lyon, Lille and elsewhere, he added. Paris has struggled for years to combat high levels of smog and the authorities have introduced fines for any vehicle not carrying a \"Crit'Air\" emissions category sticker - part of a scheme to promote lower-emitting vehicles. Several routes in the capital now have restrictions on car use and a 3km (1.8-mile) stretch of the Right Bank of the River Seine has become pedestrianised. Ms Nonnez says she has led a healthy life, first as a dancer and more recently as a yoga teacher, but has increasingly suffered from respiratory problems, ranging from chronic asthma to pneumonia. When pollution hit the worst levels for a decade last December, her existing bronchial condition prompted an acute pericarditis attack. \"The doctor treating me says Paris air is so polluted that we're breathing rotten air. She has other patients like me, including children and babies too. My cardiologist says the same,\" she told the France Info website.",
        "When we arrived in darkness all was calm and quiet. We were greeted courteously by men carrying copies of the US constitution, who told us they were unarmed. They had draped the US flag over a sign at the entrance to the wildlife refuge and they offered us a cup of coffee. The guards told us that the armed men inside were not taking visitors at present but would be happy to come out and meet the media face to face in the morning. One of the men tried to give me a small US Fish and Wildlife Service sign from the building \"as a souvenir.\" \"It's mine,\" he said, \"I paid for it,\" making a reference to his taxes. A short distance away, down a slope in the darkness, sat the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge itself, a collection of more than a dozen buildings which serves as the headquarters for a sanctuary established by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1908. A spot popular with birdwatchers keen to catch a glimpse of a greater sandhill crane may seem an improbable symbol of oppression but the men here insist the federal government has overreached its authority and has no right to this land. The refuge abuts property owned by the two men whose incarceration sparked this whole protest, Dwight Hammond and his son Steven. Their lawyer told the BBC that the Hammonds, who have already served time in prison for setting fires which spread to public land, had travelled to California on Sunday to hand themselves in after federal prosecutors won an appeal that resulted in lengthier jail terms. Publicly they have distanced themselves from the action, taken by people who are not neighbours or locals. But some people in the community around the town of Burns say while they do not approve of the methods, they are in tune with the sentiment. Back at the bird reserve, the mood changed slightly as the day dawned, the birds started singing and the winter sun struggled to pierce the hazy clouds. The media were now at the gate in force and the men there were more reluctant to talk. \"We need to stick to the narrative,\" one told us as he explained why we needed to wait for their leader Ammon Bundy. Down a slight hill, we could now see the headquarters clearly, the red roofs of the sheds standing out against the snow. Several dark-clad figures moved around in the complex. At the top of a metal observation tower two men surveyed the surroundings. There was not much for them to see apart from satellite trucks, camera crews and a solitary, unexplained drone. For miles around there was no sign at all of any law enforcement officers although the word in Burns, some 30 minutes away, is that the hotels are packed with FBI agents. Critics of this occupation are putting pressure on the federal authorities to enforce the law and end it. They have accused the occupiers of this building of being domestic terrorists, using force to impose their will. Those involved insist they are patriots and they claim they have the law on their side. The US constitution prohibits the federal government from owning this land, they say. When Mr Bundy emerged to speak to the media he refused to tell me how many people were inside the bird sanctuary or how many were armed but, after the news conference, camera crews were given a limited tour of the site. Several children also came along although the militia men said the youngsters were visitors who were not staying on the site. We were told we would not be shown anything relating to \"operational security\" or anything that would \"put lives at risk\" and, indeed, we were kept away from any weapons on the site. A number of US government vehicles sat in the car park, covered in snow. We were not allowed into most of the buildings and saw no more than a dozen men and one woman inside. We were taken into a building where one of the protestors said he had been sleeping. It appeared to be a gym for the federal employees who usually manage this land. There were cans of chicken noodle soup, oranges, apples and other food. Through a glass window we could see a man and a woman cooking food in a kitchen. The site appeared to be in good condition. Not all of the men here were keen to talk but those who were have urged supporters to take up arms and join them to assert the rights of ranchers in the American west, rights which they say have been trampled by a federal government over-reaching its authority. They say they are prepared to stay here for years to make that point and, so far, there is no sign at all of them leaving or being forced from this land. But with the absence of law enforcement this is not a stand-off. Not yet anyway.",
        "In an unexpected move, Greece's culture minister said the country would pursue a \"diplomatic and political\" approach to retrieving the sculptures instead. In doing so, the country has rejected the advice of barrister Amal Clooney, who had urged Greece to take Britain to the International Criminal Court. The Marbles were taken from Greece's Parthenon by Lord Elgin 200 years ago. Greece insists the Parthenon Sculptures - as they are properly known - were taken illegally and has pursued a high-profile campaign in recent years for their return, latterly with the help of Mrs Clooney. Mrs Clooney reportedly submitted a 150-page report to the Greek government this week urging it to formally request the repatriation of the marbles and take Britain to the International Criminal Court if it refused. But Greece's culture minister Nikos Xydakis told the country's Mega TV: \"One cannot go to court over whatever issue. Besides, in international courts the outcome is uncertain.\" He said he believed attitudes to the future of the Marbles were slowly changing and would favour Greece in a diplomatic approach. For 30 years, Athens has been locked in a bitter dispute over its demand for the marbles to be returned. The British Museum recently turned down a proposal by UNESCO, the UN cultural agency, to mediate in the dispute. Mr Xydakis condemned the refusal, accusing Britain of \"negativism\" and a \"lack of respect.\" In December, the museum loaned one of the marbles for the first time to Russia for a display in St Petersburg's State Hermitage Museum. The Greek Prime Minister at the time, Antonis Samaras, said the museum's decision was \"an affront\" to the Greek people.",

        "So far troops have rescued 150 people from the worst-hit site in central Kegalle district, but hopes are fading for another 134 still unaccounted for. No more people were found overnight, dead or alive - on Wednesday 14 bodies were pulled from the mud. Five more bodies were found at the site of another mudslide in the district, bringing the death toll there to 10. Landslides and flooding caused by days of torrential rain have hit many parts of the country, killing at least 43 people in total, according to official figures. Nearly 350,000 people have been displaced. In the worst-hit area, Aranayake district, three villages were buried after a huge section of hillside sheared away in the rain on Tuesday. Bad weather is hampering the army's efforts to reach possible survivors. \"I fear the missing 134 could be dead at this point,\" Maj Gen Sudantha Ranasinghe, the officer in charge, told BBC Sinhala. \"But we will continue our operation to recover the bodies to give families some peace.\" We started to climb up to the disaster site with troops who were going back on Thursday morning to continue to search for survivors. However they suspended their mission and evacuated the area along with us and some villagers who had returned. Rain was beating down on the collapsed mountain again, creating a risk of further landslides. We had to take shelter in a tiny schoolroom on higher ground. Villagers we spoke to were losing hope of finding any more survivors. We waded through mud and silt to reach the foot of the mountain where most of the devastation has taken place. Army units have identified several places where people may have been buried in the landslide. In one of the villages, Pallebage, local resident PG Sekara said: \"The army keeps going up the mountain, but they're not going to find anything. To find survivors they will have to dig about 40 feet now.\" Prema Adikari said she feared she had lost her brother and his family. \"My brother's house is completely destroyed. They were inside when the mudslide started. His 15-year-old daughter and his wife were also in the house,\" she told BBC Sinhala. \"When it rains, the canal waters nearby get so loud - they had not heard the neighbours warning. Only one member of the family remains, my nephew, who had gone to the shops nearby when the landslide struck. At least we want to see their bodies.\" At Bulathkohupitiya, the site of the second, smaller landslide in Kegalle district, six people are still reported missing. Sri Lanka's monsoon rains often bring floods but officials say these are the worst for several years. Many displaced people have moved to shelters, and officials have appealed for water, dry food rations and sanitary items. Low-lying coastal areas have also been hit. In southern India the authorities are on alert as the rains move up the country's east coast. At least 280 people died in a month of heavy rains and floods in the city of Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu state last year. The rains, the heaviest there in a century, were blamed on climate change although city officials were also criticised for being unprepared. Other parts of India have been suffering a severe drought in recent weeks.",
        "Hoa Titcombe's husband James said he told Furness General Hospital staff \"several times\" his wife was ill. Midwives Catherine McCullough and Gretta Dixon are accused of failing to have Mrs Titcombe assessed. But midwife Caroline Duncan told the Nursing and Midwifery Council there was \"no evidence\" they knew she was ill. Mr and Mrs Titcombe's son Joshua died of an infection in 2008, nine days after he was born. On day two of the misconduct hearing, Ms Duncan said Ms McCullough did meet the standards expected of her. However, she said that if the patient did tell her she was ill she should have referred her to be assessed in accordance with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) and midwifery rules. She also told the hearing there was also no evidence that Ms Dixon was aware Mrs Titcombe had been unwell. It is alleged Ms Dixon failed to refer Mrs Titcombe for an assessment when she was told she had been unwell, on 26 October, 2008. Ms McCullough faces the same allegation, as well as failing to take a urine sample to test for infection. An independent inquiry into the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust last year found 20 major failures from 2004 to 2013 at Furness General Hospital and concluded there were \"lethal failures.\" Eleven babies and one mother died after being cared for at the hospital during this time. The hearing continues.",
        "Having a baby is a joyous occasion for most women - but for one in 10, pregnancy and the period following childbirth can be anything but rosy. Depression, anxiety and stress can be the overriding feelings they experience and, if left untreated, the risk increases that they develop into serious psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, psychoses and eating disorders. The mental health of this group of women during pregnancy and after birth - whether the illness already existed beforehand or developed for the first time - has been of particular concern to mental health professionals for some time. Psychiatric disorders are the cause of 7 of all maternal deaths during pregnancy and the six months after the birth. So why are there still women falling through the net? Guidelines from NICE, the health watchdog, say women at risk of mental health problems should receive extra support at all stages of pregnancy, be provided with a care plan for their treatment and be offered advice on the safest and most appropriate drugs to take during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Research suggests providing this level of care will improve not only the long-term well-being of the mother but protect the child's emotional and physical development too. But the Maternal Mental Health Alliance (MMHA), which represents more than 70 organisations committed to improving the mental health of mothers and their infants, says this isn't happening in many areas of the country. Dr Alain Gregoire, consultant and honorary senior lecturer in perinatal psychiatry, and chair of the MMHA, says this failure is costing lives. Suicide is an increased risk for women with serious perinatal psychiatric disorders, he says. And then there's the cost to society, he points out, of PS8bn a year in lost earnings and NHS care. He says: \"It's a very critical time in women's lives and it's important to get it right.\" The inquest heard that Ms Bevan stopped taking her anti-psychotic medication some time before the birth of her daughter because she wanted to breastfeed. Dr Gregoire says decisions like this should be part of a care plan agreed in advance and need not be a major issue, he adds. \"There are many medication options available with no evidence of risk to the baby, whereas there is clear evidence that women being unwell is not good for mother or baby.\" Stopping medication suddenly is never advised and can be avoided because there are always other effective treatment options, he says. Rachael Jones felt no connection with her pregnancy and no happiness at the thought of son's arrival five years ago. She had always wanted children but she didn't tell anyone how she was feeling because she didn't understand the feelings herself. \"No-one asked me how I was feeling. There wasn't an opportunity to talk about it, no invitation to chat about it from anyone I saw.\" It was only after the birth that Rachael admitted to a health visitor that she felt detached, lonely and depressed. She had experienced suicidal thoughts too. During a 12-month wait for talking therapy on the NHS, she relied on family and friends to help her get through each day with postnatal depression. And, in the meantime, she set up a charity dedicated to pre and postnatal depression advice and support, called the PANDAS Foundation. She says the Charlotte Bevan inquest demonstrates how important it is for pregnant women to be able to talk about their mental health. Rachael wants communication between health professionals to improve so that women like her are properly supported during pregnancy. She also believes doctors and midwives need a better understanding of mental health so that they can ask the right questions and offer support at the right times. If or when a pregnant woman's mental health deteriorates, the guidelines state that all women with a child under a year old should be offered a place in one of the 17 specialist psychiatric care mother and baby units in the UK. But a map of these dedicated mother and baby units, with an average of eight beds per unit, show that some areas such as the south, south-west and east of England, and Wales, are noticeably underserved. Another map of specialist community perinatal mental health teams across the UK shows there is a very patchy service, with most areas having an extremely basic level of provision, or none at all. However, Alistair Burt, Minister of State for Community and Social Care, said perinatal mental health was a strong priority for the government and it was investing PS75m over the next five years \"to help drive improvements.\" \"Since 2010 the number of in-patient mother and baby units which specialise in caring for women during the perinatal period has almost doubled and we have trained more than 600 perinatal mental health visitor champions.\" The Royal College of Midwives has said that more midwives with specialist training in mental health are needed to work with at-risk women. But this relies on GPs, midwives and health visitors recognising that their patients are suffering in the first place. NHS England estimates that around 3 of women who give birth each year will be referred to psychiatric services and 1 will need specialised care in a mother and baby unit. That's 6,700 women with serious mental illnesses who need specialist help. They are at one end of a wide spectrum of mental illnesses which can affect pregnant women - ranging from mild to severe. Rachael did not take any medication for her condition. All she wanted was to speak to someone else who felt the way she did, so she could feel normal. Instead, she suffered in silence.",

        "Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said his team had been in \"constant\" contact since the Paris attacks. Elsewhere, hundreds are protesting over plans to clear away homeless residents in central San Francisco. The Super Bowl is the climax of the American football season, and a crowd of 70,000 is expected for the game. The Denver Broncos will be taking on the Carolina Panthers in the biggest National Football League (NFL) game of the year, as part of a landmark Super Bowl 50 - marking half a century of the big game. Thousands of police and security officers are expected to be deployed across the San Francisco Bay area, which covers nine different counties. The game will be held in Santa Clara, about 40 miles (64km) south of San Francisco. Officials say they are not responding to a specific threat, but have been urging the public to remain vigilant. \"We are always informed by recent events and what we see in the world situation,\" Mr Johnson told reporters earlier this week, referring to the deadly attacks in Paris in November last year which killed 130 people. \"The threat picture is different every February,\" he added, keeping a tight lid on further details of the security plans. A senior NFL official, Jeffrey Miller, told Reuters that some 4,000 private security staff had been brought in to support police in securing the area. Meanwhile, CNN reports the US Air Force is deploying two of its aircraft - an F-15 Eagle and a Cessna 182 - to provide air cover for the major sporting event. The use of drones from flying within 32 miles of the Super Bowl stadium in Santa Clara, California, has also been banned between 14:00 and 23:59 PST on 7 February. In a video to sports fans released on Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned the stadium is a \"no-drone zone.\" It comes as protests erupted this week over plans by the authorities to clear the streets of San Francisco of its homeless residents. Some 200 people gathered in the city on Wednesday shouting \"no penalty to poverty,\" and demanding the authorities do more to help the city's estimated 7,000 homeless people. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee indicated in August last year that they would make efforts to remove them, saying \"they're going to have to leave.\" But city officials insist they are offering alternative accommodation for homeless people before telling them to move - a claim protesters deny. Another point of contention raised by the demonstrators is the 5m expenditure on the Super Bowl, as well as the millions spent on TV advertisements during the game, which some argue could have gone towards housing hundreds of homeless residents.",

The Edinburgh club responded via Twitter, saying: \"Hibernian are aware of the sanction imposed by Uefa on head coach Neil Lennon and are in the process of appealing the suspension.\"",
        "The so-called Islamic State group (IS) has said it carried out the attacks. The group has established a presence in Yemen since a civil war broke out there and has carried out numerous attacks. It is opposed to the government and Shia Houthi rebels who have seized much of the country, including the capital Sanaa. The attacks come on the eve of the first anniversary of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition against the rebels. Both civilians and military personnel were killed by the blasts, officials said. Dozens of others were wounded. Two of the bombings hit checkpoints next to a base used by the coalition, they said. Gunmen then tried to attack the place. The third explosion happened when an ambulance laden with explosives was detonated next to a military checkpoint. No end in sight to war in Yemen Practising medicine under fire in Yemen The war the world forgot? Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe Who is fighting whom? Meeting the Houthis and their enemies Aden was recaptured by government troops backed by the Saudi-led coalition last year. The campaign was launched in March 2015 in an attempt to oust the rebels from Sanaa and restore Yemen's government. Riyadh says the Houthis, who are allied with forces linked to the former president, are supported militarily by its regional rival Iran, something it denies. Since the offensive started, more than 6,200 people have been killed, half of them civilians, according to the UN. The war has left Yemen fragmented and facing a humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, IS and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) have exploited the conflict to expand the territory under their control.",

        "More than 100 British Transport Police (BTP) officers will patrol the 144 Underground stations open all night to try to \"set behavioural standards.\" The Met says overall crime levels will be unaffected. But fewer than half of Londoners say they will feel safe on the Night Tube. A report by the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee reveals TfL believes anti-social behaviour will rise on the all-night service, causing \"high crime levels\" and a \"rowdy environment.\" The BTP has identified 12 \"red\" stations where a special policing plan will be put in place: Piccadilly Circus, Charing Cross, Leicester Square, Victoria, Oxford Circus, Waterloo, Vauxhall, London Bridge, Camden Town, North Greenwich, Brixton and Hammersmith. Illegal taxi touting is expected to increase at the end of Tube lines. However, police believe some crime will effectively be displaced from night buses to the Tube. \"Despite these concerns, BTP is confident that robust analysis has been carried out to ensure the Tube remains safe for passengers and staff, but it will be difficult to be sure until it is up and running,\" says the report. Forty-six percent of Londoners told a recent YouGov poll that they would feel safe taking the Night Tube, with 38 feeling unsafe and 16 unsure. According to TfL's quarterly safety survey, Londoners are less likely to avoid using public transport because of a fear of crime than they were seven years ago. Overall crime on the network has fallen, although reported sexual offences and violence against the person are up. But although 15 had experienced unwanted sexual behaviour on the network, 90 of those did not report it. The BTP told the committee that most of these were \"stealth offences committed in crowds, in crowded tube carriages, frankly, which is sexual touching and horrible behaviour like that.\" A text messaging reporting service, 61016, was launched last year to encourage people to report unwanted sexual behaviour. On the New York subway, poster messages try to deter offences, but TfL research found that women who had experienced unwanted sexual behaviour did not want to be reminded of it by posters.",
        "According to Russian television, the Ukrainian government has\"unleashed real combat on its own people,\" while pro-Russian gunmen in Ukraine are presented as local people bravely fighting for their rights. Official state channel Rossiya 1 TV said that while Kiev labelled the militia and protesters in the south-east as \"terrorists,\" locals strongly disagreed. It showed some civilians insisting that they were not separatists. \"Kiev is threatening the citizens of Donetsk Region with psychological attacks from the air. Periodically, military helicopters and planes circle menacingly over the towns of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk,\" Rossiya 1 TV said. Another strand of coverage by Russia's three main TV channels, though, has been to portray the Ukrainian army as weak, disorganised and suffering from poor service conditions and low morale. One report by NTV - owned by state gas giant Gazprom - reported that Ukrainian troops had refused to take orders from their commanders and sided with pro-Russian militiamen, a presenter for NTV reported. \"Many servicemen are clearly confused and don't understand how they could point their guns at Ukrainians, the same people as them,\" the channel's correspondent says. Russian TV channels have also been showing footage of what they say are local people in Donetsk and Luhansk regions confronting Ukrainian troops. In one instance, locals are seen persuading the crew of a tank not to shoot at civilians. In another, they stop and loot a military truck. In contrast, Ukrainian TV channels have been supportive of what they see as the Kiev authorities' efforts to rein in\"separatists\" and \"militants supported by Russia.\" Ukrainian TV channels say \"small groups\" of violent protesters demanding federalisation or annexation by Russia do not reflect the true sentiment of residents of eastern Ukraine most of whom, they say, want to live in an undivided Ukraine. They have been broadcasting comments from ordinary people in the streets of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv, most of them saying they want their region to stay in Ukraine. The demands of some Ukrainians for action against the separatists also feature heavily. State-owned UT1 TV provided live coverage of a rally in Kiev's Independence Square, where around 10,000 people demanded that the authorities act more resolutely to protect the eastern regions from \"Russian aggression.\" Ukraine's press, meanwhile, is full of doom-laden speculation about Russia's intentions. \"If it fails to push through a federation, Russia will bet on splitting Ukraine - all Russian-speaking regions will become unrecognised territories under the imperial protectorate of the Russian Federation,\" Volodymyr Fesenko writes in Segodnya. Others think Russia's ambitions do not stop there.\"Moscow wants the whole of Ukraine. Entirely. Using any means,\" navy admiral Ihor Kabanenko says in an article in the Den daily.

Gatwick's chairman Sir Roy McNulty said: \"These guarantees would mean Gatwick takes on the main risks of building the new runway.\" The Airports Commission is currently considering three options for expanding airport provision in south-east England and is due to publish its findings in the summer. These options are a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow or a second runway at Gatwick. Gatwick has \"guaranteed\" the project would be privately funded with no need for public subsidy, that airport charges would be capped and it would bear the main risks of the expansion plan.

        "Last year serious floods hit north and mid Wales, and one woman died. Environment Minister John Griffiths announced that the Welsh government plans to spend PS47m in 201314 on schemes to protect 1,000 homes. However, that is likely to be less than the amount spent on flood defences and dealing with coastal erosion in the previous two years. \"We know our climate is changing and that as a result we are set to see, and have already seen, an increase in rainfall and storms,\" Mr Griffiths said. By working together and sharing knowledge \"we can vastly improve our resilience to flooding in Wales,\" he said. Outlining his plans, Mr Griffiths said: \"Continued investment in flood and coastal erosion risk management is a vital part of our work to manage flood risk, and in spite of a reduction in our overall budget from the UK government the Welsh government has maintained its level of investment in this area. \"In 201314 I am investing PS47m in flood and coastal erosion risk management which will pay for major flood defence schemes in some of our most vulnerable communities including Swansea vale, Fairbourne, Corwen and Coldbrook, Barry. This would protect 1,000 homes and businesses currently at risk of flooding. Although the Welsh government's \"baseline\" spending on flood defences is growing slightly, other sources of funding have been cut. The PS47.2m earmarked for the next financial year compares to PS52.7m this year and PS51.9m the previous year. In the past extra funding has become available during the year, meaning the amount that is eventually spent could rise if the same happens again. Mr Griffiths added: \"It is so important that we effectively target our funding for flood defence.. \"That is why my national strategy includes a commitment to developing a national funding policy as well as a method for prioritising investment. \"A group has been set up to progress this work and once completed the national programme of investment will enable areas of Wales to be ranked according to risk from all sources of flooding and coastal erosion.\" Last year was a disastrous one for flooding in Wales. In June, a month's worth of rain fell in 24 hours in Ceredigion, hitting Aberystwyth and surrounding villages, trapping people in their homes and flooding caravan parks. In November, a 91-year-old woman died and more than 1,000 people had to leave their homes after the River Elwy burst its banks in St Asaph, Denbighshire. In December, heavy flooding hit the Vale of Glamorgan while homes in Ystalyfera in the Swansea Valley were evacuated after landslips brought thousands of tonnes of soil down onto a road. Monday's summit in Cardiff unites the Welsh government, local authorities, the Met Office, Environment Agency Wales, Welsh Water, and other organisations. It coincides with climate change campaign Climate Week. Emyr Roberts of Natural Resources Wales, a new agency that will take over responsibility for Environment Agency Wales, the Countryside Council for Wales and the Forestry Commission next month, said he thought Wales had the right approach to flooding in the past. \"Obviously in many areas the answer is to raise flood defences, but increasingly we're putting more emphasis on communities - raising awareness about what the flooding risks are and what individuals can do about it,\" he said. \"Obviously, we're working very closely with the emergency services, but I think the summit.... will be looking at longer term issues and ways in which we might use the natural environment to alleviate the problems of flooding.\" Local Government Minister Carl Sargeant said the role of the local community was also important in tackling the challenges caused by severe weather. Communities which develop a flood plan can act more quickly and effectively when flooding happens. \"It is vital that services comes together and work hard to save lives, protect property and help communities recover,\" said Mr Sargeant. \"This was demonstrated in serious flood incidents last year and we owe our emergency services a debt of gratitude for their professionalism, commitment and dedication.\"",

        "Greater Manchester Police (GMP) apologised for racial stereotyping for using a fake terrorist shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" in the mock terror attack. Organisers of the meeting at Longsight Saath Saath are demanding an inquiry. GMP said it has no plans to issue any further statements on the training exercise staged at the Trafford Centre. The scenario for the mock suicide bombing was by an extremist Daesh-style organisation although GMP had said the event was not linked to any specific terror threat. Syed Azhar Shah, who chaired the meeting attended by about 30 people, said GMP assistant chief constable Garry Shewan's apology was not enough and \"only acceptable\" if those responsible resigned. He said while the training exercise was a good idea but it was \"shocking to portray Muslims as terrorists\" and that only one group would commit terrorist acts. He said: \"It is also shocking what our children and community who live in this country will see themselves as; terrorists or British citizens?\" Mr Shah said further events would be held to \"condemn this\" and \"ensure this would not happen again.\" He said one apology \"would not mend so many hurts.\" One of those at the meeting said using a Muslim as a terrorist sent out \"the totally wrong message\" and \"puts a wedge\" between the community and GMP. \"We are all British citizens. As far as Islam is concerned it does not permit any killing.\" Greater Manchester's police and crime commissioner Tony Lloyd, said it was \"frustrating\" the operation had been \"marred by the ill-judged.... and unacceptable decision\" to have the terrorist shout'Allahu Akbar' before setting off fake bombs. Other locations in the three-day counter-terrorism exercise include Redbank Community Home in Newton-le-Willows.",
        "Norwegian researchers report that the sea ice is becoming significantly thinner and more vulnerable. Last month, the annual thaw of the region's floating ice reached the lowest level since satellite monitoring began, more than 30 years ago. It is thought the scale of the decline may even affect Europe's weather. The melt is set to continue for at least another week - the peak is usually reached in mid-September - while temperatures here remain above freezing. The Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI) is at the forefront of Arctic research and its international director, Kim Holmen, told the BBC that the speed of the melting was faster than expected. \"It is a greater change than we could even imagine 20 years ago, even 10 years ago,\" Dr Holmen said. \"And it has taken us by surprise and we must adjust our understanding of the system and we must adjust our science and we must adjust our feelings for the nature around us.\" The institute has been deploying its icebreaker, Lance, to research conditions between Svalbard and Greenland - the main route through which ice flows out of the Arctic Ocean. During a visit to the port, one of the scientists involved, Dr Edmond Hansen, told me he was \"amazed\" at the size and speed of this year's melt. \"As a scientist, I know that this is unprecedented in at least as much as 1,500 years. It is truly amazing - it is a huge dramatic change in the system,\" Dr Hansen said. \"This is not some short-lived phenomenon - this is an ongoing trend. You lose more and more ice and it is accelerating - you can just look at the graphs, the observations, and you can see what's happening.\" I interviewed Dr Hansen while the Lance was docked at Norway's Arctic research station at Ny-Alesund on Svalbard. Key data on the ice comes from satellites but also from measurements made by a range of different techniques - a mix of old and new technology harnessed to help answer the key environmental questions of our age. The Norwegians send teams out on to the floating ice to drill holes into it and extract cores to determine the ice's origin. And since the early 90s they have installed specialist buoys, tethered to the seabed, which use sonar to provide a near-constant stream of data about the ice above. An electro-magnetic device known as an EM-Bird has also been flown, suspended beneath a helicopter, in long sweeps over the ice. The torpedo-shaped instrument gathers data about the difference between the level of the seawater beneath the ice and the surface of the ice itself. By flying transects over the ice, a picture of its thickness emerges. The latest data is still being processed but one of the institute's sea ice specialists, Dr Sebastian Gerland, said that though conditions vary year by year a pattern is clear. \"In the region where we work we can see a general trend to thinner ice - in the Fram Strait and at some coastal stations.\" Where the ice vanishes entirely, the surface loses its usual highly reflective whiteness - which sends most solar radiation back into space - and is replaced by darker waters instead which absorb more heat. According to Dr Gerland, additional warming can take place even if ice remains in a far thinner state. \"It means there is more light penetrating through the ice - that depends to a high degree on the snow cover but once it has melted the light can get through,\" Dr Gerland said. \"If the ice is thinner there is more light penetrating and that light can heat the water.\" The most cautious forecasts say that the Arctic might become ice-free in the summer by the 2080s or 2090s. But recently many estimates for that scenario have been brought forward. Early research investigating the implications suggests that a massive reduction in sea ice is likely to have an impact on the path of the jet stream, the high-altitude wind that guides weather systems, including storms. The course and speed of the jet stream is governed by the difference in temperature between the Tropics and the Arctic, so a change on the scale being observed now could be felt across Europe and beyond. Kim Holmen of the NPI explained how the connection might work. \"When the Arctic is ice free, it is not white any more and it will absorb more sunlight and that change will influence wind systems and where the precipitation comes. \"For northern Europe it could mean much more precipitation, while southern Europe will become drier so there are large scale shifts across the entire continent.\" That assessment is mirrored by work at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting, based in the British town of Reading. The centre's director-general, Alan Thorpe, said the link between the Arctic melt and European weather was complicated but it is now the subject of research. \"Where Arctic sea ice is reducing in summer - and if we have warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the north-west Atlantic - these twin factors together lead to storms being steered over the UK in summer which is not the normal situation and leads to our poorer summers.\" But the research is in its earliest stages. For science, the Arctic itself is hard to decipher. The effects of its rapid melt are even tougher.

        "Hamilton has triumphed in all three races since retiring from the season-opener in Australia, which Rosberg won. Rosberg said: \"Every weekend is crucial but the results momentum is on his side and I need to try to turn it around. \"Definitely that is the case. I have come here to win, to try to extend the lead in the championship.\" Lewis Hamilton has completed 169 racing laps out of a possible 224 this year (following his retirement from the Australian GP). Of those, he has spent 164 in the lead (97). Hamilton is four points behind his team-mate in the drivers' standings and the Mercedes car has such a performance advantage that the two are effectively competing for wins only with each other at every race. Hamilton said: \"This is a much more intense season so far and perfection is required every weekend to get that result, especially when you have a good team-mate who is also doing an exceptional job.\" Hamilton has out-qualified Rosberg in three of the four races so far this season, each time when there was a wet qualifying session. Rosberg said: \"What I need is a normal weekend and then I'm sure I'll be able to turn things around.\" Both men said they expected the nature of Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya could mean they face a tougher challenge from their rivals than has been the case so far. Long, demanding corners predominate at the track, which is renowned as one of the severest tests of a car's aerodynamic capabilities on the Formula 1 calendar. The competitive order may also shift as Barcelona is a race where teams traditionally bring their first big upgrade package of the year. Hamilton said: \"It depends what step they make but the Red Bulls are at the back of my mind. \"They have perhaps a little more downforce than us, they just don't have as much power. \"This is very much a downforce-dependent circuit, so you'll get a real good indication of how good their car is.\" Alonso finished third in the last race in China after a troubled start to the season for Ferrari, but said he would not start the weekend of his home race expecting to repeat that result. \"We will do our best but we know it will be a tough weekend. Today, sitting here, if I tell you I will fight for the podium, I would lie to you and I don't want to do that for all the people coming,\" said the 32-year-old, a hero for the tens of thousands of Spanish fans who flock to the race. Four-time champion Vettel, who has been beaten by team-mate Daniel Ricciardo in the last two races and is struggling to adapt to the new Red Bull, said: \"Mercedes are in a very strong position. They are difficult to beat, but it's never impossible. \"At the moment there are a couple of things we need to get on top of and then it should be a different story.\" Spanish Grand Prix coverage details.",

Hearts struck the crossbar through John Souttar, but Caixinha was positive about Rangers' display. \"One team dominated from the beginning to the end,\" Caixinha told Rangers TV. \"I'm disappointed with the result, of course, which is the most important thing, but I really liked the team. Hearts] tried to create something at the beginning of the game to delay our pace, they did it, but we finish the first half completely dominating, with some very good chances to score, which we could not do. \"I'm happy with the way they fought until the end. \"You cannot control this type of situation but what you can control is what the boys did, the effort, the hard work, the teamwork, not allowing the opponent to play and always looking to play our game.\" Rangers have now dropped five points in consecutive home games - against Hearts and then Hibs - as Caixinha integrates the nine new players who arrived during the summer. The Ibrox manager insists his side are playing well, but failing to convert chances and not maintaining a high enough intensity to their play. \"The only point I need to refer to is the pace of the passes needs to be higher, a higher tempo of passing and moving,\" Caixinha said. \"Regarding to the overall and especially the ending position on attack, we were very good. \"I don't remember one single transition from the opponent, or one single time where they could get the confidence to try to beat our last line. \"We did everything we could to win the game, we had the chances to win it but we could not do it. \"The timing and the tempo of the passes, the way we move in attack, yes definitely we need to improve that - that's all I take because the boys leave everything, they play the way we want them to play. We created chances and avoided the opponent having transitions, but we didn't score goals. \"We are controlling the moments of the game but should be more aggressive in the last third. To win you need to score goals, and we didn't do that.\"",
        "Shoppers are expected to spend almost PS1bn online on Monday - up almost a third from last year, according to analysts at Experian-IMRG. Sales are expected to hit record numbers over the weekend, following the Black Friday sales promotions. Amazon said it had its biggest sales day in the UK on Friday, selling more than 7.4 million items. Visa Europe said: \"It looks like Black Friday has cemented its place as the busiest online shopping day of the year. \"More than PS760m was spent online with Visa cards, up nearly 25 on last year,\" it said, adding that PS2.2bn is predicted to be spent online on its cards over the four-day period. Department chain John Lewis said that this year's Black Friday saw its biggest ever single-day trade, up 11.9 compared with last year, mainly driven by sales on its website. According to Experian-IMRG, PS1.1bn was spent online on Black Friday, up more than a third from last year. Based on the number of items sent from online retailers over the weekend, Royal Mail said that most online shopping orders came from Norwich, Dorchester and Exeter. The chief executive of Very.co.uk and Littlewoods, Alex Baldock, told the BBC said that he expected this year's Cyber Monday to be bigger than Black Friday last year. But he warned customers that deliveries could take as long as 10 days rather than the usual 48 hours, adding that he expects 100,000 new customers to log on over the period. Adding to warnings about deliveries, logistics expert Stuart Higgins from LCP Consulting told the BBC that Black Friday's orders equated to about 22 million parcels, with a similar volume expected to be generated on Monday. However, he added: \"A staggering 10 of that won't be delivered on time and that's because retailers haven't got their back-end fulfilment capabilities - their organisation, processes and infrastructure - in place to cope with the marketing hype that has been created around Black Friday.\" After chaotic scenes at some stores on Black Friday last year, this year saw much calmer trading as more shoppers decided to hunt for bargains online. Analyst Miya Knight from Planet Retail said that Currys and PC World saw online traffic increase 1000 on the morning of Black Friday.",
        "Russia was suspended by governing body the IAAF for state-sponsored doping in November 2015, a ban extended on Monday to cover the 2017 World Championships. Mutko, who was criticised by the IAAF on Monday, accepted \"there were many abuses and breaches\" but says \"colossal work has been done\" over the last year. Russia expects to be back by November. A return to competition will require the reinstatement of the national drug-testing agency, which remains suspended over various allegations of covering up doping. Mutko - who assumed his role in October - has been outspoken since the McLaren report alleged there had been a state-backed Russian doping programme. In January he said female doping results can be distorted if athletes have had sex in the days leading up to a test. But on Monday he said: \"Athletes broke the rules and many coaches don't understand how to work without doping and it's high time for them to retire.\" Russia will miss the World Championships which begin on 4 August in London, but some athletes from the country could compete in London under a neutral banner. The IAAF is so far considering 35 applications from athletes, who could be included if they can show a record of independent drug-testing by agencies other than the suspended national body. Russian track federation vice president Andrei Silnov said he was against the inclusion of neutral athletes in principle but also questioned if the country's problems were as bad as the IAAF outlined. \"It's all being solved, slowly but surely. We're doing what we need to do,\" Silnov said. They say we have a culture of doping. What culture of doping?\"",

The mounds are large piles of burnt waste, often including ashy deposits and stones that have been shattered by heat. They are usually horseshoe-shaped and found close to streams, and archaeologists say that they are the product of repeated events of burning.

He said: \"It is the most extraordinary self-inflicted wound I have seen an opposition party inflict on themselves in many, many years.\" Prime Minister David Cameron said the Labour MP's actions were \"completely appalling,\" suggesting that she was \"sneering at people who work hard, are patriotic and love their country.\" The 54-year-old entered Parliament as MP for Islington South and Finsbury in 2005 and served as shadow energy and health spokeswoman before taking the role of shadow attorney general in 2011.

However I will not let anything distract from Labour's chance to win the coming general election.\" \"I have therefore tonight told Ed Miliband I will resign from the shadow cabinet.\" Labour MPs said she had been right to stand down, Chris Bryant telling the BBC \"the first rule of politics is surely that you respect the voters.\" \"She was absolutely wrong to tweet what she did,\" he said. \"All I can say is, if somebody came into my constituency and did that, I would be furious.\" And John Mann said the incident was \"horrendous\" for Labour. \"It insults people like me, it insults the people I know - my friends and family - Labour voters across the country because white vans, England flags, they're Labour values and actually pretty routine Labour values for most of us,\" he told Today. He praised Mr Miliband's response, adding: \"I think this is a different approach from the Labour leader and his message came out very, very clearly last night and she's had to go, she's been forced out.\" But Mr Farage suggested the episode reflected broader attitudes within parts of the Labour Party. \"The Labour Party hate the concept of Englishness,\" he told the BBC News Channel. \"They have done for a very long time. \"New Labour can't even stand the concept of patriotism. They think the flag somehow is unpleasant, backward-looking and nasty. People like Emily Thornberry would rather we had that blue flag with 12 stars on it that comes to us from Brussels.\"",
        "A message on Luton councillor Aysegul Gurbuz's Twitter feed claimed Hitler was the \"greatest man in history.\" Another tweet on Ms Gurbaz's account suggested Iran could develop a nuclear weapon to \"wipe Israel off the map.\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said anyone who makes anti-Semitic remarks is \"auto-excluded from the party\" pending an inquiry. The BBC has contacted the councillor for comment. The Labour Party has confirmed she has been suspended pending an investigation. Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Corbyn said: \"Anti-Semitism is absolutely abhorrent and wrong. \"We have suspended, we will suspend, any member that behaves in that way.\" The tweets in question were made before Ms Gurbuz was elected to Luton Borough Council in May 2015. A spokesman for the council said: \"While these comments appear to pre-date her time as a councillor, the council is shocked by these comments. \"This matter will be referred as a matter of urgency to the council's independent standards committee to allow a full investigation to take place.\" On Thursday, Mr Corbyn was criticised by a Jewish leader for not taking anti-Semitism seriously enough.",
        "Lil' Chris, whose real name was Chris Hardman, rose to fame in Channel 4's Rock School. He was found dead at in Lowestoft on 23 March. His family said the 24-year-old struggled with mental health issues and depression. A private funeral was held earlier this month. The inquest, at St Margaret's House in Lowestoft, was told the full hearing has been adjourned until 28 July. Suffolk coroner Dr Peter Dean conducted the short hearing, which was told the musician was found by his friend. The emergency services were called to the house in Union Road, before Mr Hardman was declared dead an hour later by a paramedic. Dr Dean expressed his \"sympathy\" to the family. Following Mr Hardman's death, fellow musicians and fans paid tribute on social media to the singer, who had his first hit single with Checkin' It Out. It followed his appearances in the Channel 4 series with Kiss frontman Gene Simmons in 2006, which was set at the town's Kirkley High School. Guy Barnes, a producer who was working with Hardman, said: \"As much as we're all mourning the death of the boy, everybody needs to put as much love and strength as they possibly can do into the Hardman family because I don't know how anyone deals with that.\" In a statement released after Lil' Chris's death, his family said he was a \"huge personality who will be missed by everyone who knew him.\" \"He was a hugely creative person who used this side of his personality to make others smile, to cheer people up and to make others feel better,\" they said. \"A real people person, he would always take the time to stop and talk, no matter who or when and we are proud that he was so well thought of by all who knew him.\" Family and friends gathered for his funeral on 8 April in Gorleston, Norfolk, before releasing balloons in his favourite colour of green on Claremont Pier in his hometown of Lowestoft. Samaritans' deputy chief executive Fiona Malcolm has said the charity had been \"saddened\" by his death. \"If anyone has been affected by this news, or is struggling to cope, we would like to let people know that Samaritans is here for them if they need to talk,\" she said.",

        "Government limits to teachers' pay and \"real terms cuts\" to school budgets risk undermining standards, they warn. \"Teachers need a pay rise,\" they urge, in a joint statement to the School Teachers' Review Body (STRB), which sets their pay. The government said it was attracting \"the best and brightest\" to teaching. Teachers' pay increases have been limited to 1 or less for the past five years, and the government aims to keep to this limit for the next four years. With long, hard working hours and a relatively low starting salary for a graduate, it is hardly surprising that teacher recruitment is struggling. Qualified teachers in England can expect to start on PS22,000 outside London or PS27,000 in inner London. In most cases, this is after post-graduate training, a year's school placement and a degree course. And although there is room for growth and progression - based on performance of course - many newly-qualified teachers find the pressures of the job too much and leave soon after taking their first post. Teachers in England have some of the longest hours and largest classes in the developed world, says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Teaching unions have complained that although their staff were promised a 1 pay rise, this has had to be found from within existing school budgets. Head teachers say school budgets are already at breaking point as they struggle to deal with other inflationary pressures. But the DfE maintains new trainees can benefit from financial support, a good salary, enviable job security and a generous pension. In October, England's education secretary, Nicky Morgan, wrote to the STRB to remind them of this policy. But the joint statement warns that \"as pay and prospects improve in comparable occupations,\" further pressure will be placed on teacher recruitment and retention. This means more children will be taught by teachers who are not specialist in the subjects they teach, it adds. With budgets \"at breaking point,\" schools will struggle to maintain current spending - \"let alone afford pay increases,\" it continues. \"The government must fully fund the necessary pay increases for teachers and school leaders in both England and Wales.\" The six unions are: Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, described four more years of pay austerity as a \"false economy.\" Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said teachers \"are already leaving in droves and new graduates looking elsewhere for a career.\" Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, claimed 160,000 more teachers would be needed over three years to cope with a rapid increase in pupil numbers. But she warned unless the picture improved the government would have little chance of meeting this target. \"Schools will have to start increasing class sizes or shutting courses and cutting the subject options available to pupils.\" And Elaine Edwards, UCAC's general secretary urged the government to reconsider its pay policies \"for the sake of our children and young people and the education system as a whole.\" The STRB is expected to make its recommendations on teachers' pay in April. A Department for Education spokeswoman said it had worked with the profession to \"raise the status of teaching,\" adding that that a record number of highly-qualified graduates and \"experienced career changers\" were now teaching. She added: \"But we are determined to go further, and recognise that some schools find it harder to recruit the teachers they need, which is why we are expanding the great Teach First and Schools Direct programmes and we are launching the National Teaching Service, which will mean more great teachers in schools in every corner of the country.\"",
        "Last month, the board of crofting's regulatory body apologised for its handling of the dispute with crofters. It also asked convener Colin Kennedy to resign. But Mr Kennedy told BBC Scotland's Sunday Politics Scotland he was staying in the post. The dispute relates to the running of common grazings, including at Mangersta and Upper Coll on Lewis. Mr Kennedy said: \"I have no intention of resigning. \"As matters stand, I believe the commission have acted wholly within the law at all times and until such times as we have legal advice to the contrary, I will maintain my position.\" Last week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish government ministers had the power to intervene in the affairs of the troubled commission.

However, during First Minister's Questions in Holyrood on Thursday, she said legislation did give them the power to intervene if required.",
        "The Fukui District Court lifted an injunction that had blocked the reopening of two reactors operated by Kansai Electric Power in the western city of Takahama. The injunction was issued after locals argued the reactors could not withstand a strong earthquake. Japan closed all its nuclear reactors after the Fukushima disaster in 2011. The Takahama plants had already obtained approval from the country's nuclear watchdog. \"Today's two rulings show a recognition that safety has been ensured at Talahama Nuclear Power Station,\" Kansai said. It aims to restart the reactors next month. The vast majority of Japan's nuclear reactors remain closed - according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, the country's nuclear generating capacity is running at less than 5 of its full potential. The government is keen to restart more reactors, which before the Fukushima disaster supplied about 30 of the country's power. Japan has been forced to import fossil fuels to make up the shortfall.",

        "Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said the playwright was \"one of our greatest literary exports.\" The initiative will include working with young people without access to school in developing countries. The British Council's Sir Ciaran Devane said the project would reflect Shakespeare's \"global impact.\" Speaking in the Houses of Parliament at the launch of Shakespeare Lives, Mr Whittingdale emphasised the playwright's cultural significance and international influence. \"Shakespeare is a major driver of tourism and also an important player in our export market. And the creative industries which he towers over are a huge part of our economy,\" said Mr Whittingdale. \"It is very hard to overstate the scale and scope of his reach.\" Partners in the 400th anniversary project include the National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company, Shakespeare's Globe and the BBC. There will be performances, publications, films, broadcasts, online events and festivals. Schools in the UK and around the world will be given resources and video clips, exploring themes such as \"global citizenship.\" But there will also be an alliance with Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO) to use the Shakespeare events to reach those young people who are excluded from education. Despite a millennium pledge for universal primary education, there are about 58 million children who have no access to school - mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. There are an estimated 250 million young people around the world who are unable to read or write. \"When millions of children cannot read, they become cut off from learning those lessons that literature can offer,\" said Philip Goodwin, VSO chief executive. The exercise in cultural \"soft power\" will include events in the United States, Bangladesh, Malaysia, New Zealand, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Sir Ciaran, British Council chief executive, said the playwright was \"one of the most enduring examples of cultural impact and relations.\" He said the \"genius\" of Shakespeare's language had given \"people from all walks of life a platform for self-expression.\"",

His parents were told he might never walk again, but they said he has now exceeded all his doctors' expectations. The family has raised nearly PS100,000 for the services that saved his life. Felix was on his way to school when he tripped in the road and was hit by a car as he was getting to his feet. His mum Vanessa said the accident was \"horrific\" and added: \"You just think this can't be happening to you. \"It was just a normal Wednesday, normal things going on, and your life is turned upside down into an unrecognisable sate where you are thrust into a hospital environment. \"At first I don't think we really realised the extent of his injuries. \"It's been a slow process of learning to do things again, learning to walk, learning to eat, drink normal fluids.\" She added that her son has surpassed all expectations and made \"amazing\" progress. Felix's dad Stuart said his life was saved by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance, which flew him to hospital, and the Southampton General Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. He said: \"We wanted to repay them for saving his life. It's been fantastic, the whole community has come together.\" The family set up a charity, Fit For Felix, inspired by his love of running and named by his friend Bradley. It has now raised PS93,850 by organising a range of activities including fun runs, bike rides, and sponsored swims.",
        "Pavey, a mother of two who only gave birth to her younger child Emily 11 months ago, ran the perfect tactical race to match the gold won by her old friend Paula Radcliffe in Munich 12 years ago. When France's Clemence Calvin - 16 years her junior and almost 20 seconds faster this season - went to the front with two laps to go Pavey tucked in behind. Then, at the bell, the Briton surged into the lead, held Calvin at bay on the back straight and kicked hard again as she came off the top bend to race to her first ever major title. She becomes the oldest female gold medallist in the championships' history, and having won Commonwealth 5,000m bronze 10 days ago seals a wonderful summer at an age when most athletes are long retired. Pavey told BBC Sport: \"I just can't believe it. I was finding it quite a long way - I was thinking, is this the right event? \"I'm really thrilled. I tried to do a controlled last lap, but when I got to the home straight I thought, just give it all you've got, so you don't regret anything.\" The time - 32 minutes 22.39 seconds - was irrelevant, Calvin hanging on for silver and her compatriot Laila Traby taking bronze. British team captain Goldie Sayers had given a speech on the eve of the championships asking her team-mates a simple question: \"How would you perform if this was the last time you would ever compete?\" Her room-mate Pavey gave the best possible answer. The Exeter Harrier has been running for her country for so long that she made her debut in a British vest in the same year her team-mate Morgan Lake was born. Across four Olympic Games she has secured three top ten places, but this was a glorious finale that few could have predicted. And on her lap of honour she ran to Emily and four-year-old son Jacob before embracing husband and coach Gavin and her own parents. Earlier, all three of the British men made it safely through to Wednesday's semi-finals of the 100m, Dwain Chambers winning the second heat in 10.18 secs and James Dasaolu the third, easing up in 10.22 secs, before Harry Aikines-Aryeetey took his in 10.19 secs. But France's Jimmy Vicaut, the only man in the field to run under 10 seconds this summer, looks the man to beat after an impressive 10.06 secs - the joint third fastest time in the championships' long history. World champion Christine Ohuruogu also appears to be coming into some form at the right time, winning her 400m heat in 51.40 secs, while Tiffany Porter is into the 100m hurdles final as the fastest qualifier. But there was disappointment for Britain's two 800m men, Andrew Osagie and Michael Rimmer, who failed to get through to the semi-finals, 28 years after the famous night when Sebastian Coe, Tom McKean and Steve Cram won European gold, silver and bronze for a British clean sweep.",
        "He welcomed Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny's comments on a possible referendum on Irish unity. DUP MP Ian Paisley said Mr Kenny was \"being mischievous.\" The taoiseach said Brexit talks should consider that a clause in the Good Friday Agreement could result in the calling of a referendum. In his remarks to reporters on Monday at the annual MacGill Summer School in Glenties, County Donegal, Mr Kenny said the triggering of a border poll required \"clear evidence of a majority of people wishing to leave the UK and join the Republic.\" He added: \"It may be, in the eyes of some, a fanciful theory but who knows what happens in 10, 20 years time?\" Adams responded by calling for all parties supporting a united Ireland \"to discuss how best this can be achieved.\" \"In the context of the north being dragged out of the EU by England, there is now a greater opportunity to achieve this,\" he said. North Antrim MP Mr Paisley said Secretary of State James Brokenshire and his predecessor, Theresa Villiers, had both ruled out holding a referendum. \"It's not going to happen,\" he said. \"We all know in the next nine months Enda Kenny is not going to be taoiseach. So, he's really just being mischievous.,\" Mr Paisley added. Ulster Unionist MLA Jenny Palmer described Mr Kenny's comments as \"much ado about nothing.\" She said that, in the wake of the EU referendum, the Stormont executive's priority should be \"to convince the people of Northern Ireland that they have a plan for the way forward for our economy, our farmers, our voluntary and community groups, our universities and everyone else who depends heavily on EU funding and support.\"",

        "League of Gentleman star Steve Pemberton will adapt EF Benson's novels about two ladies who vie for social prestige in small-town England. The characters were previously played by Prunella Scales and Geraldine McEwan in a Channel 4 series in 1985. Richardson, who will play Elizabeth Mapp, said: \"I cannot wait to get my teeth into Mapp, and of course, Lucia.\" \"I am so looking forward to a summer of hard work and I hope, great fun,\" said the Parade's End star. Chancellor - whose recent TV credits include Fleming and The Hour - said she was \"thrilled to be playing the glorious Lucia.\" \"I hope I can do justice to EF Benson's wonderful creations,\" she added The comic drama, set in the 1930s, focuses on the snobberies and pretensions of life in the quaint English town of Tilling - and the rivalry which ensues between the visiting Mrs Emmeline Lucas (Lucia) and Tilling socialite Elizabeth Mapp. \"I feel sure viewers will relish their time in Tilling, and will enjoy watching the slyly scheming Mapp take on the gloriously haughty Lucia in a dizzying round of bitter bridge parties, devious dinners and malicious musical evenings,\" said screenwriter Pemberton. Pemberton - who is currently starring in BBC One drama Happy Valley - described himself as a \"long-time fan\" of Benson's six \"deplorably funny novels.\" \"But be warned,\" he added \"this is no jolly period romp.

        "Four days after the launch of the anti-corruption move, long queues continue outside ATMs as people try to exchange the 500 (7) and 1,000 notes. \"It had to be done suddenly but I never thought I will receive blessings for this,\" Mr Modi said. He hinted that other measures aimed at fighting corruption and the black economy might follow. Urging people to be patient, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that it would take a few weeks for banks and ATMs to completely replace the old notes, estimated to make up some 85 of the total currency in circulation. Mr Jaitley said that nearly 30bn in the old notes had so far been deposited in banks across the country. But chaotic scenes can still be witnessed outside banks as public patience is beginning to wear out, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi. Some traders and small business owners have threatened to go on strike because they have been badly affected, our correspondent says. The opposition has also been critical of the move, saying the rural and urban poor have been hit hardest. But Mr Modi thanked his fellow countrymen who had \"accepted the decision in national interest.\" And he warned that there was \"no guarantee\" that new measures would not follow after the note-exchange scheme ends on 30 December. He said \"no-one would be spared\" in the drive against corruption. But \"honest people will not face any problem,\" he added. After Mr Modi's surprise announcement on Tuesday night, the banks were closed on Wednesday. Thousands of panicked Indians have been flocking to banks since they reopened on Thursday. There are limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks. The 500 (7; PS6) and 1,000 (15; PS12) rupee notes are the highest denomination notes in the country and are extremely common in India. Airports, railway stations, hospitals and fuel stations will only accept them until the end of today. People will be able to exchange their money at banks between 10 November and 30 December. The actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of \"black money\" - which may have been acquired corruptly, or is being withheld from the tax authorities - is a huge problem. India's government hopes to flush out tax evaders and make money that is unaccounted for visible for tax purposes. There have been reports of tax raids in many parts of India. An individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash. Government guidelines say it is possible to exchange up to 4,000 rupees per day up to 24 November - anything over this will be subject to tax laws. People can also withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from a bank per day and a maximum of 20,000 rupees per week. New 2,000 and 500 rupee denomination notes with new security features are being given to people to replace those removed from circulation. A new 1,000 rupee note \"with a new dimension and design\" will also be introduced in due course, a senior government official said on Thursday. They can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to 5,000 rupees using these bank notes at airport exchange counters until midnight on Friday.",
        "On Wednesday the US Congress voted for a law allowing families of nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks to sue. In doing so they overrode a veto by President Barack Obama, who said it would set a \"dangerous precedent.\" Fifteen of the 19 hijackers that day were Saudi nationals, but the kingdom has denied any role in the attacks. In a statement, the country's foreign ministry said: \"The erosion of sovereign immunity will have a negative impact on all nations, including the United States.\" The 911 bill row, explained Their argument parallels the one made by Mr Obama. He said on CNN after the vote that the law set a \"dangerous precedent\" and could lead to the US being opened to \"a situation where we're suddenly exposed to liabilities for all the work that we're doing all around the world and suddenly finding ourselves subject to private lawsuits.\" Meanwhile, leaders of the Republican party in Congress have said they want to reconsider the law. The Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell admitted that lawmakers had not understood the possible consequences of the legislation. \"Everybody was aware of who the potential beneficiaries were but nobody really had focused on the downside in terms of our international relationships, Mr McConnell said. The White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was \"a pretty classic case of rapid onset buyer's remorse.\" On CNN, Mr Obama also suggested that that voting patterns in Congress were influenced by political concerns. \"If you're perceived as voting against 911 families right before an election, not surprisingly, that's a hard vote for people to take,\" he said. \"But it would have been the right thing to do.\" Saudi Arabia, an oil-rich kingdom and key US ally in the Middle East, had lobbied furiously against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism (Jasta) legislation. It has stopped short of specifying how it might retaliate but has called on Congress to reverse the decision. Relatives of those killed in 911 have welcomed the bill's passing. \"We rejoice in this triumph and look forward to our day in court and a time when we may finally get more answers regarding who was truly behind the attacks,\" said Terry Strada, national chair of the 911 Families Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism.",

        "The firm announced it had switched on its service in 130 additional countries. It said it was still trying to expand to China. The other exceptions are North Korea, Syria and Crimea, where it is banned from operating by US law. The announcement was made by the firm's chief executive Reed Hastings at his keynote speech at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. He also confirmed that Netflix would begin offering HDR (high dynamic range) content later this year. The company's shares closed the day more than 9 higher. \"We were expecting Netflix to go everywhere, but this has happened more quickly than we thought,\" commented Fernando Elizalde from the tech consultancy Gartner. \"Until now, the firm had been doing it in phased stages because of the costs of marketing and dubbing or subtitling the content. \"But it's worth remembering that in some of the emerging economies it will only be people in urban areas that will be able to use it because of limited internet availability.\" Mr Hastings said Netflix was in talks with the Chinese government, but acknowledged it would take time to reach an agreement. \"It's a very large country, you know a billion Chinese that we want to give access to the Netflix content,\" he said. \"In China you need specific permission from the government to operate, so we are continuing to work on that and we are very patient.\" But one company watcher had doubts. \"China is going to be a tough nut to crack given that that three strong domestic services already exist,\" said Mike Goodman from Strategy Analytics. As part of its expansion, Netflix has added support for Korean, Chinese and Arabic to its list of supported languages. That brings the total number - in which the firm provides subtitles, captions and alternative audio - to 21 languages. Mr Hastings added that Netflix would initially focus on expanding the reach of its existing content rather than commissioning extra locally-made shows. For consumers who already have Netflix, the biggest change may be the addition of HDR. High dynamic range video allows compatible TVs to show millions more colours and a wider dynamic range - added shades of brightness in between black and white - letting more detail be shown. Many experts believe the impact is greater than that of just jumping from 1080p to 4K ultra-high definition resolution alone. One consequence of using the format, however, is that it requires more data, and few TVs support it yet. Mr Hastings said users with compatible TVs should get a \"visceral sensation that's pretty amazing.\" The firm's rival, Amazon, began streaming a limited number of shows in the format in 2015. Audience members at the Las Vegas event were also given a first look at some of the service's forthcoming shows, including: Ironically, the clips were blocked for those watching a live stream of the event. The firm also teased Chelsea Does..., a documentary series presented by the comedian Chelsea Handler that will cover topics including drugs, racism, marriage and Silicon Valley. In addition, it announced Ricky Gervais was directing and starring in a film called Special Correspondents about a journalist who broadcasts fake war reports, which will be added to its library in April. Mr Hastings also revealed some fresh statistics about the service. He said it now served a total of 125 million hours a day of entertainment to its viewers, and had streamed 12 billion hours-worth of video over the final three months of 2015, which is nearly 50 up on the same period in 2014.

        "The state department's John Kirby said Pakistan must target militant groups. The United Jihad Council - a coalition of militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir - has claimed responsibility. The attack on the Pathankot base near the Pakistani border is seen as an attempt to derail recent peace moves by Pakistan and India. \"The government of Pakistan has spoken very powerfully on this and it's our expectation that they'll treat this exactly the way they've said they would. We have been clear with the highest levels of the government of Pakistan that it must continue to target all militant groups,\" Mr Kirby said. Five militants and seven Indian soldiers have so far been killed during four days of fighting. The army is still conducting clearing operations inside the 2,000 acre base. The United Jihad Council was formed in 1994 to co-ordinate resources and plans to hit military targets in Indian Kashmir among more than a dozen groups based in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. Those groups were widely seen as being brought together by Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency. The UJC is led by Mohammad Salahuddin, the leader of the pro-Pakistan Hezbul Mujahideen group, the largest in the alliance. The leadership of most of these groups is based in Pakistan, and they have been largely dormant since the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto boundary dividing Kashmir. So the claim by the UJC to have carried out this latest attack is likely to strengthen the view that it was authorised by the Pakistani army to undermine Mr Modi's recent peace overtures to Pakistan's civilian government. The Pakistani military has been accused of sabotaging the civilian-led normalisation process with India on several occasions in the past. The UJC could also be trying to remain relevant even after India strengthened the LoC to stop infiltration of militants from the Pakistani side. On Monday evening, a senior security official told a press conference that all families living on the base were safe and \"all strategic assets [helicopters, aircraft and other military hardware] were secured.\" Maj-Gen Dushyant Singh, from India's elite National Security Guard, said it would take a \"long time\" to declare the base completely secure, because of its size and geography. Meanwhile, police in Punjab's Mohali district said they had arrested three men with illegal arms and recovered a Pakistani \"SIM card\" from them. It is not yet clear whether the men had any connection with the attack, police said. The Pathankot assault started before dawn on Saturday when a group of gunmen - wearing Indian army uniforms - entered the residential quarters on the base. Hours of heavy gunfire followed and a helicopter was seen firing at the facility on Sunday. The attack is being seen as a blow to an apparent Indo-Pakistani peace initiative launched just days ago. Hopes for a thaw in relations were raised after Mr Modi paid an unexpected visit to his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif. Pakistan's foreign ministry and the US state department have condemned the attack. Pathankot air force base is about 430km (270 miles) north of the Indian capital, Delhi, and is on the road linking Indian-administered Kashmir with the rest of the country. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen a long-running insurgency against rule from Delhi, and Kashmir has been a flashpoint in relations between Pakistan and India for nearly 70 years since independence.",

Asia's biggest market, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 0.3 higher at 17,014.78. Shares in the embattled electronics firm Sharp rose 9.4 on new reports it was close to a deal with Taiwan's Foxconn. The jump came after the Nikkei business daily reported that Sharp and Foxconn parent company Hon Hai Precision Industry were continuing talks, with both sides seeking to conclude a takeover deal by Monday. Earlier talks had been delayed when Foxconn said it had received new information from Sharp which needed to be clarified. In Australia, the ASX 200 index finished the day up 0.2 at 5,090.02.

        "It is thought about 400 people in Northern Ireland live with permanent disabilities after surviving gun and bomb attacks. Those injuries include amputations, paralysis and blindness. They did get compensation, but they say it is now running out. Some victims now rely entirely on benefits. Because they could not return to work due to their injuries, they have not built up work-based pension savings. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is presently preparing a bill to go through Stormont to put a special pension in place for them. Current victims' legislation in Northern Ireland from 2006 does not judge how someone became injured. It is argued that means former paramilitaries should be eligible to get this pension if their injuries are serious enough. It is thought 10 former paramilitaries fall into this category. More could come forward if the pension scheme goes ahead. But the DUP say their proposed bill does not need to rely on that current definition of a victim. They plan to exclude anyone with a terrorist conviction. Ernie Wilson was a school bus driver and member of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). In 1988, his bus was blown up by the IRA in Lisnaskea. He suffered injuries to his legs and eyes. He says no paramilitaries should be entitled to the proposed victims' pension. \"My message is pay the people that have been injured by the terrorists. Full stop. \"I know the men that are injured have to live, they have to get food, they have to get clothed, they have to be looked after. \"But they should not be getting a pension for trying to kill me.\" Yet the BBC's Spotlight programme has learned that the injured paramilitaries have support from some surprising quarters. Paul Gallagher was 21 when the loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) took over his house with the aim of killing a republican who lived nearby. When they could not find their target, they shot Paul six times. He was left paralysed from the waist down. He told Spotlight that allowing injured paramilitaries to avail of the pension was a price worth paying. \"It's a tough one. Say somebody was seriously injured, even by their own hand, they have needs now. So, I mean, they need to be looked after. \"If they go forward to the NHS they are not going to be turned away at the door. \"So why should they be turned away at the door of maybe the victims and survivors' service or other sorts of services? \"For me, it is as simple as just looking at human suffering really as the qualification for eligibility or even to be recognised as a victim.\" Sinn Fein told Spotlight they would not support the DUP bill if former paramilitaries are to be excluded. Spotlight was broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland on Tuesday 2 June, and is available on the iPlayer.",
        "Vaughan Gething said he was \"looking again at charging arrangements\" for people from countries without reciprocal arrangements with the UK. In a new BBC Wales poll, 79 of those surveyed said they would increase charges for visitors from outside the UK for using the health service. But Mr Gething said such charges were a \"marginal area\" of NHS activity. Speaking to The Wales Report on Wednesday, he said: \"We have reciprocal arrangements with most European countries, and as long as those reciprocal arrangements work I see no reason to intervene and change those. \"However for people outside the UK and Europe where we don't have those, we're looking again at charging arrangements.\" \"Later in the year I'll get to make a decision on what charging may or may not look like.\" But the health secretary added: \"This is such a marginal area of activity.\" \"Really, when you're talking about the central funding of the health service, with the big challenge that we face, the actual conversation about charging people from abroad is an absolute distraction.\" Asked whether he would consider charging patients who have illnesses caused by their lifestyle choices, Mr Gething said: \"If you're really saying, for example, that someone with lung cancer who smoked should therefore be charged for their treatment. \"I actually think that when you get into real examples like that, people will very quickly say that isn't what I think should happen. \"When you think about the practical reality of it, it isn't that simple at all.\" Mr Gething warned while the Welsh Government had made \"significant additional commitments\" to the health service from its budget, there would be difficult consequences if austerity continues across the UK. \"The challenge will be if we don't see the tide turned back on austerity every single part of the UK health service system will face really awful choices, that I don't think the public will tolerate.\"",
        "\"My first instinct was to open the wing exit and slip out with as many passengers as I could, but I realised that this would leave the rest of the passengers vulnerable,\" then flight attendant Nupoor Abrol told BBC News. Security forces laid siege to the New York-bound plane for 16 hours at Karachi airport after the jet was taken over by Palestinian militants on 5 September 1986. There was a bloody end - 22 people killed and about 150 injured. It shocked the world, and is the subject of a newly released film, but the surviving crew have until now remained silent. While they relayed the events to a private FBI meeting a week after the hijack, and to a parole hearing for the lead hijacker in 2005, this is the first time they have shared details with the media. They also shed light on the last few hours of Neerja Bhanot, their colleague who died in the attack and is the subject of the new film. They are breaking this silence now, they say, because they want to honour and acknowledge the vital roles played by all on board, most of whom are not known to the public. \"The hijack is far from over for me and my colleagues. Some of us, passengers and crew alike, are still struggling with the skeletons of the past, trying to fix the puzzle of incidents, sequences, people who were involved in the chains of events,\" says Nupoor. \"The stories may differ but the spirit remains the same.\" It was just before 06:00 and Pan Am Flight 73, on a stopover in Karachi from Mumbai, was scheduled to continue on to Frankfurt, en route to New York. There were 14 flight attendants on board, 12 of whom were preparing for take-off. Outside, four gunmen had sped on to the tarmac in a van disguised as airport security. The men entered the Boeing 747, firing shots into the air. Nupoor saw them shoot near the feet of a colleague, shouting at her to lock the door. Flight attendant Sherene Pavan, who was out of sight of the militants, heard the commotion, reached for the intercom and pressed the emergency number to the cockpit. The pilot picked up on her second attempt and she relayed the hijack code. Fellow attendant Sunshine Vesuwala saw one of the hijackers grab a colleague, Neerja Bhanot, and put a gun to her head. And then another militant, his AK-47 and grenades in clear view, instructed Sunshine to take him to the captain. The cockpit was empty. \"I noticed immediately that the escape devices in the cockpit had been deployed. I noticed that the evacuation hatch on the ceiling of the cockpit was open, but I pretended not to. I wanted to give the pilots time to escape in case they were still in the process of climbing down the ropes outside the plane. The hijacker didn't seem to know much about the plane so he didn't look for it,\" says Sunshine. \"Many have criticised the pilots for leaving the rest of the crew behind, but I was relieved when I saw the pilots were gone, as we were all safer on the ground than we would be in the air. And in any case, at least the three pilots were safe. Three lives would be saved.\" Dilip Bidichandani, another steward, is adamant that the pilots' escape actually saved more lives. \"The pilots evacuating the airplane... meant that we were not at the mercy of the terrorists, who could have instructed the plane to be flown into a building, or even blown up whilst in flight.\" The gunmen's plan was to force the pilots to fly them to Cyprus and Israel, where other members of their militant group were incarcerated on terror charges. Outside on the tarmac, Pan Am's Karachi director Viraf Doroga used a megaphone to begin negotiations with the hijackers. He told the four men that the airport authorities were looking for pilots to fly them where they needed to go. Meanwhile, inside the plane, 29-year-old American passenger Rajesh Kumar was pulled out of his seat and made to kneel in front of one of the open doors, with a gun to his head. When no pilot materialised within the hour, Mr Kumar was shot and kicked out of the plane. \"This changed everything. It showed they were ruthless killers,\" says Sunshine. Around four hours into the siege, the hijackers began trying to identify the Americans on board. The Abu Nidal Organisation (ANO), which they were members of, was opposed to US and Israeli policy in the Middle East. Sunshine, Madhvi Bahuguna and another flight attendant began collecting passports, quietly avoiding collecting any that were American. They then went through the bags of passports they had collected, secretly sifting out any remaining American ones and tucking them under their seats or concealing them in their clothing. Mike Thexton, a passenger on the plane, describes the act in his book What Happened to The Hippy Man? as \"extremely brave, selfless and clever.\" \"I may be biased but I feel that day proved that the flight attendants on board were some of the best in the industry.\" Having failed to find an American, the militants settled for someone British. Mike was made to sit on the floor, and like the other passengers, keep his hands above his head. Aside from one sharp kick, he says, he was not physically mistreated and eventually escaped with others in the later chaos. Sherene and Sunshine were the cabin crew who spent the most time with lead hijacker Zaid Hassan Abd Latif Safarini. He repeatedly led either Sunshine or Sherene at gunpoint up to the upper deck cockpit, using them as human shields while he peeked round them to have a look outside. \"On occasion he would hold my hair, force my face to the window and ask what I could see on the tarmac. He said he was looking for American fighter planes,\" says Sherene. Meherjee Kharas, a 28-year-old Pan Am mechanic on board, was forced to make radio contact with negotiators outside. At this stage the hijackers still believed a pilot would be found to fly the plane for them. Over the next few hours on the upper deck, Safarini let his guard down several times, Sunshine says. He joked and flirted, invited her to go with him to Cyprus, and promised to teach her to swim. Sunshine remained alert. At one point she looked longingly at the emergency axe in a glass box in the cockpit. Safarini, mid-joke, caught her and immediately pointed the gun at her head. \"Don't even think about it,\" he said. Eventually the militants threatened that, as a pilot had not materialised, a passenger would be shot every 15 minutes. Nupoor tried to comfort the passengers around her while her colleague Dilip Bidichandani took round sandwiches and Neerja distributed water. \"That day, knowingly or unknowingly, we came together as a team and played our parts to the best of our ability,\" says Massey Casper, another steward. Although the hijackers had closed the doors and lowered the shutters earlier, the air conditioning and lights had been on. As evening set in, the on-board power supply started to dwindle, the lights got dimmer and the cool air stopped circulating. Meherjee, the mechanic, told Safarini that the emergency power would last 15 minutes or so before the aircraft would be plunged into darkness. Sherene says she knew then that time was running out. When the lights did go out, all the flight attendants and passengers were in the middle section of the cabin, several seated on the ground in the aisles and near the doors. The gunmen positioned themselves on either side of the aisles. \"They had lost patience. They let out a war cry,\" says Sunshine, \"and began firing into the crowd. There were huge streaks of light breaking the darkness. And screams.\" Sherene saw that mechanic Meherjee had been killed. In the chaos and darkness, at least three doors had been opened, though it is not clear by whom. The door nearest the wing had been opened in manual, which meant that the emergency slide did not deploy. It was a short jump to reach the wing of the plane. Many went for it. Nupoor and Madhvi slipped off the edge of the wing, fracturing bones as they hit the tarmac around 20 feet (6 metres) below. Sunshine and Dilip were also on the wing, but in the darkness couldn't gauge the distance of the drop. They saw another door had been deployed in automatic, which meant that the emergency slide was inflated. They climbed back in through the door they had come through, and along with Sherene and another colleague, assisted and redirected passengers to the inflated slide. Massey had already exited down the slide just moments earlier, taking three unaccompanied children with him. Then, when all the passengers were off the wing, the crew did something remarkable. Not hearing any more gunfire, but not knowing where the gunmen were, they went back into the dark plane to look for survivors. That's when Sunshine saw Neerja. Neerja had been shot in her hip and was bleeding heavily, but was conscious. Sunshine called Dilip over to help, and the two carried Neerja to the emergency slide. They pushed her down first, then jumped out themselves. Sherene, and another colleague Ranee Vaswani, were the last two hostages to leave the plane. Three of the hijackers were fleeing the airport when they were caught by airport security. Safarini was still on board when Pakistan's security forces entered the plane. Neerja's colleagues say she was still alive when she arrived at Karachi's Jinnah Hospital. \"It was chaotic, like a war zone, in there. Neerja may still be alive if she'd been cared for right away,\" says Sunshine. \"I didn't see medical facilities at the airport besides minor first aid... The hospital was several kilometres away from the airport,\" says Dilip. \"Neerja was put into the ambulance without a stretcher.\" Once they finally got to the hospital, the chaos continued, Sherene says. \"Neerja's life may have been saved were conditions in the hospital better.\" After a short break all the Flight 73 crew returned to Pan Am for at least a few years. They occasionally worked the same flight and ran into each other at layovers. They didn't discuss the hijack. All have coped in different ways. Two of the six remain in the industry. During their interviews with the BBC, they stressed that there was no single hero that day, that crew members not interviewed played an equally important role, and that they want survivors of terror attacks like 911 and Paris to know that life goes on. They also want people to know they dearly miss their colleagues Neerja Bhanot and Meherjee Kharas. \"Survivors [of such atrocities] are living each day with the memories,\" says Madhvi. She hopes that, in speaking out, \"we can all connect through our survival stories and form a fabric of power and strength going forward.\"",
        "A planning application has been made for the development on green belt land at Park of Keir, near Dunblane. However a council planning and policy consultation stated the development \"cannot be supported in policy terms.\" A spokesman for Park of Keir Partners said they would discuss the report with Stirling Council planning officers. Murray, mother of tennis star Andy, and golfer Montgomerie announced plans for the facility, Scotland's first purpose-built golf and tennis centre, last summer. The proposed facility would include six indoor and six outdoor tennis courts, a nine-hole golf course with a practice range, coaching suites and a cafe, along with around 100 houses and a hotel. However, some local residents raised concerns about the development being sited on green belt land between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan. These concerns were echoed in an official planning and policy document authored by Claire Milne, a principal planning officer at Stirling Council. Her report concluded that the planned housing - included in the project to subsidise the cost of the sports facilities - \"is not intended to meet any of the local or particular housing needs, and will in fact exacerbate affordability in the local area.\" While the tennis, golf and tourism element of the proposal would \"provide a degree of social as well as economic benefit to the local area,\" the report noted that the business case submitted was \"not sufficiently convincing.\" The report also states that there is no \"overriding national need\" or a local need for the project to be sited on green belt land, a \"sensitive landscape\" which would suffer a \"significant detrimental impact\" from the development. A spokesman for Park of Keir Partners said it was \"normal practice\" for planning officers to carry out a policy review. He added: \"We plan to meet with the council's planning officers to address a number of the comments in this report and we remain confident our proposed development represents sufficient benefit to the people of the area, and Scotland as a whole, to allow members of the planning committee to approve our application.\" A date has not yet been set for councillors to consider the application.",
        "The beach where Seifeddine Rezgui stood on Friday, pulled a Kalashnikov from his parasol and unleashed Tunisia's worst ever terror attack, has already reopened. Camera crews capture the spot; passers-by pause for a moment. But the emotional scars of the tragedy that took place will live on for a generation. For 57-year-old Sabi, they're still raw. He runs the boat club on the beach, used principally by customers of the Hotel Imperial, targeted that day. He points to the spot where the gunman opened fire, appearing first to make a phone call, before throwing his mobile into the sea and beginning his killing spree. \"People all around me were falling,\" he recalls, \"and I just grabbed as many customers as I could and ran.\" They went through a staff gate to a basement of the hotel - but Sabi returned to bring more to safety. \"I saw six of our loyal customers die, people who always came to this hotel. They were like brothers to me. This beach should be full of life now. But it's deserted.\" Sabi pauses, looking at the rows of empty sunbeds. \"We will fight,\" he says, his lip quivering, tears welling up. \"At least we can still smile.\" Tunisia is a nation in shock - and its tourism lifeline is under serious threat. Thousands of holidaymakers have already left on emergency flights laid on by tour operators. I watched as another busload from the Hotel Imperial arrived at the local Enfidha airport on Saturday night, heading for Manchester. Among them was one man whose fiancee had died in front of him. Most were too traumatised to talk. But in the hotels beside the Imperial, dozens are staying put. \"I wanted to leave early,\" says Isabelle Campbell from Gateshead, \"but my husband said: if we go, they win. I'm not relaxed though, I'm nervous about going to the beach.\" Her husband, Bob Taylor, says they ventured down earlier and saw a speed-boat manoeuvring in the water, revving its engines towards them. \"For a moment, we thought: Oh God, something is going to happen again. We used to go to Egypt but changed to Tunisia because of the security threat there,\" he adds. \"Now we don't know what'll happen here.\" One in ten Tunisians works in the tourism industry. It took a hit after the attack on the Bardo museum in March - and is now widely expected to plummet. The fear of that has only added to Tunisians' anguish over a worrying rise in Islamist attacks. The birthplace of the Arab Spring, which was widely praised for its largely peaceful transition to democracy, now has more people fighting in Syria and Iraq than any other country: an estimated 3,000 Tunisians are thought to be there, many feared to have joined so-called Islamic State (IS). A once peaceful Arab democracy has been shaken by the chaos and civil conflict of neighbouring Libya, where IS has taken root and is thought to train increasing numbers of Tunisians crossing a porous border. It is all a vast challenge for Tunisia's new coalition government, which has scrambled to announce a security clampdown, including the closure of 80 mosques suspected of being breeding grounds for radical Islam. Critics say the reaction has been too late. \"These people want to destroy Tunisia,\" says Dorra Brahem, a local student, walking on the beach with her sister Aisha and friend Fatma. \"They have misunderstood Islam. Something serious is happening here.\" Has the joy of Tunisia's revolution died, I ask? \"Yes,\" says Dorra. \"At least now we can wear headscarves and go to mosques - with the old dictator, it wasn't like that.

        "The left-back was expected to miss Saturday's defeat by Aberdeen while he sought the advice of a specialist to help with a hip complaint. But Clark was impressed as the former Rangers defender declared himself fit. \"He has shown the courage that he wants to play through the little injury problem he has,\" said Clark. \"He didn't look like he had any injury on Saturday.\" Smith could not prevent Kilmarnock losing 2-1 to the side sitting second top of the table and falling five points behind Hamilton Academical in their battle to escape the play-off place. However, Clark said of his captain: \"I saw him bombing down the line in the 94th minute to try and put a cross in as we chased an equaliser. \"So I was really happy he was back in the team. \"It's no co-incidence we looked a stronger team when Stevie was back in. \"He's a good example to everyone else in the squad that, as captain, he's willing to put himself forward when not 100 fit and roll his sleeves up. That's brilliant for me.\" However, Clark insisted that he would not want Smith to do anything that would cause problems with his career. \"I'm not a manager who wants to put somebody in jeopardy by making an injury worse, but it's great to see him putting his body on the line to help the club,\" he added. \"We are hoping to manage him through until the end of the season. \"Ultimately, it will be down to Steve whether that proves too difficult. \"Some sessions he might just work with the physio, but he's an experienced player, he's got good fitness levels and knows his body, so we're prepared to work with him to get him out on the park on a match day, because having him there will be crucial for us.\"",
        "Andrew Bedford, 27, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, was last seen in September 1990. Officers reopened the investigation in April, and discovered human bones on land off Stocking Fen Road in Ramsey. A 64-year-old man from Ramsey has been arrested. Mr Bedford was last seen on the evening of 28 September at Factory Bank, off Great Whyte, Ramsey. Three people were arrested in connection with his disappearance but no-one was charged. In April, Cambridgeshire Police reopened the investigation as a murder inquiry, saying they believed he had been shot. Detectives think Mr Bedford was killed with a shotgun sometime during the evening of 28 September at a garage called Mongrel Cars, which no longer exists, in Ramsey. They began searching land in the town in April. Bones \"consistent with being human\" were found by scenes of crime officers, forensic scientists and detectives during the 13-day operation. Det Ch Insp Martin Brunning, who is leading the murder inquiry, said: \"The bones were discovered during a painstaking search of the area we had identified as being of interest. \"An expert in forensic anthropology has assisted the investigation and the bones will now be subject to DNA testing and much more intrusive forensic analysis.\" Mr Bedford was last seen eating a takeaway in a light blue Ford Cortina car. He was wearing overalls, a khaki jumper, jeans and trainers. He was described as 5ft 8in (1.72m), medium build with mousey blond, curly, shoulder-length hair and had a number of tattoos.

        "Surrey County Council leader David Hodge said the government had cut its annual grant by PS170m since 2010. The proposed increase would add nearly PS200 to a Band D bill, bringing it to about PS1,500. The government said if the proposed budget is set, taxpayers would have the final say in a referendum. Any authority wanting to increase council tax by more than 2 must put the plans to a vote. This would take place on 4 May, alongside local elections, and would include a vote in Chancellor Philip Hammond's constituency of Runnymede and Weybridge. Opposition councillors in Surrey said the increase would be unaffordable for many residents and it followed financial failings by the council and the government's failure to fund services properly. Council tax analysis - Pete Sherlock, BBC News data journalist We can't say what the average rises are set to be this year, as not all local authorities have declared their intentions. However, last year the average Band D council tax set by local authorities in England for 2016-17 was PS1,530. This was an increase of PS46 - or 3.1 on the 2015-16 figure of PS1,484 - and 1.6 of that was the adult social care precept. So Surrey's rise is five times last year's average. This shows how council tax hikes were brought down post 2008, but are now on the rise again. Mr Hodge said the council had to set a budget for 2017-18 that would protect vital services. He said: \"The government has cut our annual grant by PS170m since 2010, leaving a huge gap in our budget. \"Demand for adult social care, learning disabilities and children's services is increasing every year. \"So I regret, despite us finding PS450m worth of savings from our annual budget, we have no choice but to propose this increase in council tax.\" Liberal Democrat leader Hazel Watson said a 15 rise would hit the elderly and those on fixed incomes hardest. She said: \"It is astonishing that the Conservative administration think Surrey residents should carry the can for their own financial failings and the government's failure to properly fund services.\" The Conservative council had failed in its negotiations with the government, even though three cabinet ministers were Surrey MPs, she added. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are MPs in the county along with Philip Hammond. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: \"If the council sets this proposed budget, then the taxpayers of Surrey will have the final say in a referendum in May. We should trust the people. \"Our long-term funding settlement means more spending power for Surrey County Council during this parliament, with PS3.2 billion to deliver the services that local people want.\" Analysis: Jack Fiehn, BBC Surrey political reporter For years, senior councillors have spoken out about cuts to the authority's central grant and the impact on adult social care and children's services, as well as school places and road maintenance. There has been huge frustration and we seem to have reached a crunch point. Surrey residents are used to council tax rises. They have gone up every year since 2012 - but never by such a large amount. This will be a test of public support. The Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Green Party all oppose a referendum, but David Hodge has told me he has the support of his fellow Conservatives. So unless something significant happens, it is almost certain to go ahead. He has also denied reports there will be a deal with ministers to abandon the vote, putting the government on course for a row with a council in the Tory heartland. Former care minister and Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said Surrey's decision would be a test for local authorities, which were seeing increasing numbers of older people and younger people not getting the care and support they need. Shadow local government secretary Teresa Pearce said: \"Forcing councils to rely on council tax income to fund statutory services, such as social care, is simply unsustainable and unrealistic.\"",

        "Some 450,000 asylum seekers have entered Germany already this year and up to a million are expected in 2015 - by far the most in the EU. The government in Berlin has broadly welcomed refugees, relaxing EU rules so that it no longer sends back Syrians to other EU countries. But it introduced temporary border controls on Sunday after admitting that its capacity had been stretched to the limit. Until now, the federal government has insisted it can cope with the high numbers of asylum seekers but wants the burden shared between EU countries. Authorities have been giving assistance to new arrivals at stations in Munich and other German cities before taking them to reception centres. The \"Koenigsteiner Key\" is used to distribute asylum seekers across Germany's 16 federal states, calculated according to their tax revenue and their population. For example, North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, will be expected to take 21 of all asylum seekers, while Thuringia, the focus of several attacks on asylum accommodation, is set to receive under 3. With a huge build-up of asylum seekers in the Bavarian city of Munich, and reception centres apparently reaching capacity, authorities in affected states have been calling for the federal government in Berlin to do more. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann told radio station Bayern 2 that stricter controls were needed because \"many en route here are not really refugees.\" \"It's got about in the last few days that you are successful if everyone claims to be Syrian,\" he added. The dispute has seen Chancellor Angela Merkel come under increasing pressure particularly from political allies in the Christian Social Union (CSU), which has ruled Bavaria, Germany's wealthiest state, for nearly 60 years. State Premier Horst Seehofer described the decision to open the borders as \"a mistake that will occupy us for a long time.\" German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told Tagesspiegel newspaper on Sunday that the problem was \"not the number of refugees but the rapidity at which they arrived.\" He said \"Europe's inaction in the refugee crisis had driven Germany.... to the limit of its capacity.\" The government ordered police to begin checking travel documents on Sunday from anyone entering from the southern frontier with Austria, and federal police set up roadblocks on motorway networks. Rail services to Munich were affected by the changes, too. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the border controls would remain in place until further notice. \"The aim of this measure is to limit the current influx to Germany and to return to orderly entry procedures,\" he said. \"This is also urgently necessary for security reasons.\" The move goes against the principle of the Schengen zone, which allows free movement between many European countries. However, the Schengen agreement does allow for temporary suspensions. There have been warnings that the restrictions could make conditions worse for the thousands of migrants continuing to make the perilous journey across Europe to Germany. \"These measures will not create more order but only much more chaos,\" said Katrin Goering-Eckhardt, the parliamentary leader of the opposition Greens, according to Reuters. But the government argues that the new measures will not affect the rights of refugees coming to Germany. The temporary border controls were introduced hours before an emergency meeting of European interior ministers and Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said they were \"a signal to Europe.\" \"Germany is facing up to its humanitarian responsibility, but the burdens connected with the large number of refugees must be distributed in solidarity,\" he said. EU ministers were to vote on a May 2015 plan to redistribute an initial 40,000 asylum seekers from Syria and Eritrea through mandatory quotas. The EU has since raised the total number of people it seeks to share out through quotas to 160,000 asylum seekers across 23 EU states. But Germany says this still is not enough. Speaking in the German parliament last week, the vice chancellor described the plans as \"a first step, if one wants to be polite.\" \"Or you could call it a drop in the ocean.\" An application for asylum is made at the reception centre on arrival, where personal details, fingerprints and photographs (for those over 14) are taken. A temporary permission to stay is granted. The asylum seeker will then be invited to an interview to decide his or her case. The current average time from application to decision is 5.3 months, according to the German government. If granted refugee status, a residence permit for three years will be granted. After this time a permanent residence permit can be applied for. Germany designates all EU states plus Ghana, Senegal, Serbia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina as \"safe countries of origin\" - which means that asylum claims from nationals of these countries are likely to be rejected. On 7 September the government announced that Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro would be added to this list. Asylum seekers normally stay at reception centres for up to six weeks. After that they are offered either communal accommodation, or housed individually, depending on the policy of the federal state. People who are unable to support themselves financially \"receive what they need for their day-to-day life,\" the German government says. Support varies from state to state, but generally includes non-cash benefits covering food and accommodation costs, plus limited spending money. After being in the country for three months, asylum seekers can apply for permission to start work, subject to various restrictions. Anyone given a residence permit has unrestricted access to the labour market after four years. No - Germany has a long and complicated history of population movement. After Germany's defeat in World War Two, millions of ethnic Germans were forced to leave areas of Poland, former Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Russia and resettle in West and East Germany. The booming economy of post-war West Germany required more workers, and huge numbers of \"guest workers\" arrived from Mediterranean countries such as Italy, Spain and - most significantly - Turkey. Communist East Germany also took on temporary workers from \"fraternal socialist countries,\" including North Vietnam, Cuba and Mozambique, although most returned after German reunification. In 1991 the country enacted laws enabling Jews from the former Soviet Union to move to Germany - more than 200,000 Jewish people and their families immigrated in this way. Around 350,000 people fleeing the Bosnian conflict were given temporary refuge in Germany in the 1990s, but most have since left. In total, 20.3 of Germany's population now have \"a migration background\" - the term German officialdom uses to describe immigrants or their children. But Germany's population is shrinking, due to its low birth rate, and it has been argued that it needs migrants to keep its economy going.",
        "A new crossing is needed as part of Transport Scotland's PS3bn project to make the road dual carriageway all the way between Inverness and Perth. Transport Scotland has proposed building the new bridge further east of the present crossing, which would be removed along with an embankment. The new structure would also have a lower profile. The dualling project is to be completed in 2025. Full details of the planned new bridge have been published online and views from the public have been sought.",
        "Mr Lewandowski is charged with simple battery over his encounter with former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. Police allege that on 8 March after a news conference in Florida, he grabbed her arm when she tried to ask Mr Trump a question, leaving a bruise. Mr Lewandowski plans to plead not guilty, the Trump campaign said. Police in Jupiter, Florida, where he was arrested, have released new footage of the alleged assault. The security video appears to show him trying to pull Ms Fields out of the way as she walks alongside Mr Trump and tries to speak to him. \"Mr Lewandowksi is absolutely innocent of this charge,\" the Trump statement said. \"He is completely confident that he will be exonerated.\" Mr Trump himself has defended Mr Lewandowski on Twitter, saying the police footage shows there was \"nothing there.\" If Donald Trump is going to win the Republican nomination without a convention fight, he will have to endure yet another string of political blows that would stagger even the strongest campaign. A week before a key primary in Wisconsin, Scott Walker - the state's governor - gave a full-throated endorsement of rival Ted Cruz. Now Mr Lewandowski has been charged over his manhandling of a female reporter during a rally. This comes after a particularly tawdry few days in the Republican presidential battle as Mr Trump and Mr Cruz engaged in a war of words over their spouses. The New York property developer has been able to maintain his front-runner status for months despite countless controversies and conflagrations. This time may be different, however. Recent events are likely to cause further damage to Mr Trump's already poor standing with female voters. The Republican presidential pack has been whittled to just three candidates, with the not-Trump vote consolidating behind Mr Cruz. Mr Trump's path to securing the Republican nomination is a narrow one, so the slightest stumble could deny him the prize outright. Then it's on to the convention, where party loyalists and a growing cadre of Cruz-friendly activists hold sway. The charge comes during a difficult time for Mr Trump, just ahead of next week's Wisconsin primary where he is neck-and-neck with Senator Ted Cruz. Earlier on Tuesday, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker endorsed Mr Cruz for president. Mr Trump will participate in a CNN town hall event on Tuesday night when all three Republican contenders will face questions. He is currently well ahead in the Republican race with 739 delegates to Cruz's 465. Ohio Governor John Kasich is some way behind with 143, with the 1,237 needed to win the nomination probably out of his reach. The 40-year hurt - how Bruce Springsteen articulated the forces that underpin the rise of Trump Trumpisms - 22 things that Trump believes Donald v George Bush - How extreme is Trump? A civil war - Lifelong Republicans turned off by Trump Mr Cruz's campaign responded to the arrest by lamenting the \"abusive behaviour\" that they said seems to be part of the Trump campaign culture. That appeared to be an allusion to the Around the time of the incident between Mr Lewandowski and Ms Fields, Mr Trump was on the defensive over violence committed by supporters against protesters at his rallies. In the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton will try in Wisconsin to stem the momentum of a resurgent Bernie Sanders, who is on a roll after a string of wins.",
        "Baroness Campbell, 56, is the former boss of UK Sport. During her time at UK Sport from 2003-2013, she oversaw a rise in the number of British medals won at the Olympics. Kelly Simmons, the FA's director of participation and development, called Baroness Campbell \"one of the most influential people in British sport.\" \"I'm really excited about helping shape the future vision and strategy for girls and women's football,\" said Baroness Campbell. \"Great strides have already been made both in terms of grassroots participation and at the elite level and I'm really looking forward to building on the work already done.\" She will focus her work on increasing grassroots participation and getting further success for England's elite women's teams. England reached the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup, eventually finishing third with a 1-0 win over Germany. Campbell, who will start her new role in March, is also chair of the Youth Sport Trust and was awarded a CBE for her services to sport in 2003.",
        "It looks pretty likely that the cross-party amendment on giving Parliament a final vote on the Brexit deal will be pushed to a division. And so will the Lib Dem amendment to give people what they call \"a final say on the final deal\" and what others call a second referendum. Potentially there could be further votes on issues like the Brexit implications for Northern Ireland. The expectation is that the amended bill will get its Third Reading on Tuesday evening....but the ritual of Parliamentary ping-pong, where the Bill then bounces between the Lords and Commons until its final form can be agreed, will have to be postponed for a while. The opportunity for the Commons to accept or - more likely - reject the changes made by peers will be blocked by the debate on the Budget, which will occupy the Commons into the following week. So there will be a week or more for the pressure to build on MPs before they vote on the issue - and during the interval the Commons Brexit Select Committee will publish a report on the rights of UK and EU citizens (on Sunday) in good time to influence the vote. It's a sign of the times that Brexit could eclipse what's normally a highlight of the Parliamentary year, but there will be plenty to watch out for in what will be the last full-scale budget in March. Next year it will be downgraded to a mere \"Spring Statement\" with the Budget moving to the autumn. First up the forecasts for government debt, with the Treasury continuing to seek further austerity savings across government. Second, whether there will be an injection of extra funds to defuse the row over business rates, and third, whether the government will put more money into adult social care, and maybe even signal a long term review of the system. The Westminster buzz is that the public finances are in better shape than expected - but that any spare cash will be stashed away in a Brexit war chest, rather than spent now. Elsewhere, there's important action on the Children and Social Work Bill, where the government has delighted cross-party campaigners by bringing forward amendments to make relationship educations (emphatically not sex education) compulsory at primary school level. Cross-party pressure from family values campaigners like the influential Conservative backbencher, David Burrowes, and supporters of extended sex education like the Women and Equalities Committee Chair, Maria Miller, and Labour's Sarah Champion, appears to have secured its goal. Both groups were persuaded that a new approach was needed to tackle the problem of sexting and sexual harassment in schools. And the government may also be tested on a couple of issues on the Higher Education Bill, where there are two days of Report Stage consideration in the Lords. The Commons opens at 14.30 BST with Home Office Questions - and then watch out for any ministerial statements or urgent questions at 3.30. In particular, the Culture Secretary Karen Bradley is expected to update MPs on the proposed merger between Sky and 21st Century Fox, which has now been formally notified to the European Commission. An earlier attempt at this was withdrawn during the 2010 Parliament, in the wake of the hacking scandal, and the issue remains highly sensitive. She must decide by 17 March 17 whether to ask the regulator, Ofcom, to carry out a public interest test. Then MPs move on to the Second Reading debate of the Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill - this aims, among other things, to create a legal framework for insuring automated vehicles, because at the moment the law does not provide for them, require fuel retailers to provide charge points for electric cars, and create a new criminal offence of shining a laser at any means of transport. There's also a separate draft bill to create a UK spaceport, which will go out for pre-legislative scrutiny by the Commons Science and Technology Committee. In Westminster Hall at 16.30 GMT MPs debate e-petition 129823 which says that dress code laws should be changed so that women have the option to wear flat formal shoes at work, if they wish, arguing that \"current formal work dress codes are out-dated and sexist.\" In the Lords at 14.30 GMT the usual half hour of questions to ministers is followed by the first Report Stage day on the Higher Education and Research Bill. Expect votes on tiered Higher Educational establishments - gold, silver, bronze universities. Watch out too for a short debate on recent legislation on assisted dying in North America; and whether those laws provide an appropriate basis for legislation in England and Wales, led by Labour's Baroness Jay of Paddington. This suggests that the Lords assisted dying lobby have not entirely given up following the defeat of Rob Marris's bill in the Commons, last year. MPs begin at 11.30 GMT with Justice Questions, followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill on the Queen's Sapphire Jubilee from the Conservative, Andrew Rosindell. The day's main event is the Report stage of the Children and Social Work Bill (see above). The Conservative Sir Edward Leigh has fired in an amendment to the sex and relationship education proposals, to allow a parent to request that their child be wholly or partly excused. Labour MPs are also proposing new clauses to ensure that children in care are allowed reasonable contact with their siblings, and to revoke provisions in the Bill that enable local authorities in England and Wales to place children in secure accommodation in Scotland, and vice versa. There are a battery of amendments on child safeguarding issues including a big cross-party amendment on requiring regular reports by local councils on their ability to provide proper safeguarding services for children. In Westminster Hall, the debates are on: beer duty (9.30 GMT); the Coast to Coast Walk (11.00 GMT); the O'Neill review into antibiotic resistance (14.30 GMT); the sale of student loans (16.00 GMT) and social care in Liverpool (16.30 GMT). My Committee pick is the Home Affairs session, with Rob Wainwright, the Director of Europol on policing and security issues across the EU and Britain's role, post-Brexit (14.15 GMT). This is a key Brexit issue, and one where the Prime Minister has made clear her enthusiasm for continued British participation in Europol. In the Lords, peers open for business at the earlier than usual time of 11.00 GMT to provide extra debating time for the Report Stage consideration of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill - breaking off, briefly, at 14.30 GMT for their usual half an hour of questions to ministers. After the Report Stage, three hours of Brexit breathing space is provided while the amended version of the Bill is knocked into shape. During this interval there will be a 90 minute debate on the economic and environmental benefits of shale gas development in the UK, led by the former trade minister Lord Truscott. And then there may be an adjournment for a while, before peers can return to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, for the Third Reading debate. This is normally a rather sonorous formality, but may not be on this occasion.... The Commons opens at 11.30 GMT with Welsh Questions followed by Prime Minister's Questions at noon. And then it's onto the Budget (see above). The day's Westminster Hall debates are on: financial support for apprentices (9.30 GMT); compensation and the Pandemrix vaccine (11 GMT); the proposed ban on microbeads (14.30 GMT); extension of the right to buy to tenants of housing associations in Bedford (16.00 GMT) and broadband speeds (16.30 GMT). In the Lords at 16.00 GMT it's the second Report Stage day on the Higher Education and Research Bill. There will also be a short debate on the UK's exports strategy. MPs open at 09.30 GMT with Exiting the European Union Questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House - before moving on to day two of the Budget debate. In Westminster Hall, from 13.30 GMT, there's a debate on the Scottish Affairs Select Committee report on the Demography of Scotland and the implications for devolution. This looks at the policy problems posed by the combination of Scotland's slower population growth, its ageing population and lower life expectancy, particularly for health and care services, potentially increasing the demands on NHS Scotland and Scottish social care services in the future. At 15.00 GMT the subject is human rights and the political situation in Turkey. In the Lords at 13.00 GMT, the main event is the Second Reading of the Criminal Finances Bill which aims to tackle money laundering, terrorist finance and corruption the UK and overseas, in the wake of the Panama papers revelations of industrial scale tax avoidance. The National Crime Agency estimates that up to PS90bn may be laundered in the UK each year. The Bill was criticised in the Commons for failing to include penalties for companies which permitted their staff to facilitate money laundering, or do more to reveal the beneficial owners of assets, or deal with the lack of corporate transparency in Britain's crown dependencies and overseas territories. That is followed be a debate to mark International Women's Day. The Lords meets at 10.00 GMT to debate the detail of a series of private members bills from the Commons. First up will be the Second Reading of the Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence Bill - which incorporates the Istanbul Convention into UK law. Next the Committee stage of the Homelessness Reduction Bill - which puts new obligations on local councils to help and advise people who have lost their homes or are in danger of doing so. Then there's the Committee stage of the completely uncontroversial Parking Places (Variation of Charges) Bill - which gives local authorities more flexibility over parking charges. And finally there's a Second Reading debate on the Political Parties (Funding and Expenditure) private members' Bill [HL] from the Lib Dem, Lord Tyler. Just as the Lib Dems overtook Labour in donations for the first time ever in the final quarter of 2016, his Bill would gradually take down the maximum amount a political party can accept from any one person in a year to PS10,000 by 2026.",
        "David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, made the discovery at Blick Mead in October, and said the carbon dating results had just been confirmed. But he also raised concerns about possible damage to the site over plans to build a road tunnel past Stonehenge. The Department of Transport said it would \"consult before any building.\" The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said \"scientifically tested charcoal\" dug up from the site had \"revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC.\" David Jacques said the dig had also found \"evidence of feasting\" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: \"British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. \"Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC. \"But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead.\" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could \"provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge.\" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge. A Department for Transport spokesman said: \"As with any road scheme, we will consult with interested parties before any building begins on the A303. \"English Heritage and National Trust are supportive of our plans, and we will ensure sites of cultural or historical significance are safeguarded as we progress with the upgrade.\"",
        "Earlier this week, a councillor in the Scottish Borders said she believed people were being short-changed by the rollout of the service. BT has said it has invested heavily in providing services in areas where it was not commercially viable to do so. It has also pointed out that there are a wide range of factors at play in determining the speeds received. The BBC Scotland news website asked for your experiences of the service in the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway. Iain Rennie emailed: I live in the village of Ednam. Barely 2 miles from Kelso. We get a max of 1.5Mb. It is frustrating in the extreme to see constant TV adverts for high speed broadband when ours is too slow to stream or watch BBC iPlayer etc. As far as I'm aware there is no date or plan to upgrade this area. Byron Raistrick, of Ruthwell, emailed: Since the announcement by the Scottish Executive that the initiative was up and running, I've not seen any evidence of the PS126m being distributed fairly and efficiently to the areas that need it most - rural locations. Major cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh would have been upgraded as a matter of course by BT Openzone to cater for the businesses there and in turn the residential areas would have benefited, yet (they) have been upgraded first with the money. Linda Lonsdale emailed: We pay extra money to get superfast broadband and it is not any faster load of rubbish conned again. Susan Cook emailed: Broadband speed in our village 0.9Mb and sometimes even lower. We have been told by BT that it will be four to six years before we get anything better! And we pay the same as all their other customers. There are people living in the Borders other than in Melrose and Galashiels yet no consideration is given to them. Siobhan Liehne emailed: We live on the Mellerstain Estate near Gordon. We keep reading of ministers complaining that constituents in some Borders areas are \"only getting 2Mbps.\" Frankly I would give my eyeteeth for that kind of speed. We get 0.7 Mbps if we are lucky and sometimes it drops out altogether. Then we have to see signs up telling us that towns only a very short distance away are getting superfast. When we ring BT to try and find out when things are going to improve we get someone in India telling us that it must be our computer. If it is, then it's every computer on the estate, no matter how new it may be. Andrew Gray emailed: I live near Chirnside in the Scottish Borders which is enabled for fibre broadband. However only those residents who live within a mile of the cabinet can get anything like the speeds advertised. My house is two and a half miles from the cabinet so the fibre signal does not reach it at all. According to most comparison websites (including BT's) I can receive broadband speeds of up to 40Mb but in practice I get just over 2Mb, if I'm lucky. There should be further scrutiny of how public money has been spent on improving broadband services, particularly in rural areas, to ensure that everyone can benefit in the future. Henry Sinclair emailed: I live in Earlston and have what the major players call \"superfast\" broadband - ie fibre to the cabinet, which is 100m away or just over 200m of copper wire. The actual speeds I get vary between 20 and 70Mbps download and 15 to 20Mbps upload. My grandson who lives no more than 400m from me and 300m from a cabinet can only achieve a max of 6Mbps and pays the same as me. Copper is a 19th century answer to a 21st century question but BT continues to squander taxpayers' money on using it to provide an inadequate or in some cases no service while the solution is staring it in the face. As the internet moves from a consumer model to an interactive one the pathetic download speeds and risible upload speeds will hold us all back and eventually our interconnection system will have to be re-engineered using fibre. Why not do it now rather than throwing billions at a known fatally flawed approach? Brian Telfer emailed: I have had issues since BT started to enable the Hawick exchange well over a year ago. I was getting better speed and reliability before the exchange was enabled for fibre. I am now on fibre at double the price, with continual buffering drops in service and regular visits from engineers who contradict each other - speed can be from 1.52Mb to 20Mb - not the 52 Mbps I am paying for. Uploads are a joke - I now use my phone tethered to the computer to upload anything! Peter Dorward emailed: I read your report with interest particularly the part that referred to over PS8m being invested in super fast broadband by SBC and that 94 of homes will have it. At the moment why not focus attention on getting something like'normal' broadband speeds to all households. We have struggled at trying to conduct work when at home when only being able to access broadband internet with speeds that are barely any better than a dial up service! Any pressure that can be brought to get us to first base is welcomed. Carole emailed: We live in Bonnington Road in Peebles in a modern house and our broadband speed is very poor we are with BT and get 2Mb which is a joke. Believe one of our neighbours gets better speed. When you try to raise it with BT you don't get anywhere. Poor show.... what's fibre optic? Even a bit better speed would be appreciated fibre optic is a dream for us. David Jeffrey emailed: I work in broadband provision for local councils in the south of the country. I believe the councillor is correct in her assertion of expecting speed provision to be constant. Both BT and the industry are living in the last century of squeezing the last penny of investment out of the copper infrastructure in the ground. Admittedly fibre is not cheap, but the trial in York proves that fibre to the home is achievable with the right partnerships (CityFibre, Sky and TalkTalk in that case) Digital Scotland should be delivering more, but as long as BT have the monopoly over the infrastructure, nothing will change. However, this constant and reliable speed will come at a cost, and there is the rub. Will subscribers pay for it? I expect not. It is worth noting that businesses in south of Scotland (and anywhere else in rural UK) have enjoyed fibre services for many years, but have had to pay top whack for the privilege. Brian Heslop emails: I live in Sanquhar, Dumfries and Galloway. We're on a farm, so were considered too remote for coverage, the cabinets are located within a few hundred yards of the exchange so the cabinet is still 2.5 miles from the house. As the exchange is one where the one broadband provider is BTopenreach, so all the advertised cheap offers from EE, TalkTalk, Sky etc are not available. So the double hit of slow broadband and the highest prices. Part of the problem is the politicians not understanding what BT are selling them, it was never going to give a good service to all, using an urban solution in a rural environment. Lindsay Lewis emailed: We are lucky if we get 1.5Mb because we are several miles from the exchange. BT have not upgraded our exchange (Yarrow) and seem unlikely to do so. Why? Because there aren't enough peoplecustomers to make it worth their while. It is a disgrace - we pay the same as someone getting up to 50Mb, and what makes it even more galling is that BT are continually sending us marketing material urging us to sign up to BT Infinity! So for the foreseeable future we will continue to live in the digital dark ages. Jason W emailed: BT need to wake up and smell the coffee. Copper phone lines are dead assets - they will need to be replaced with fibre optic right to the premises sooner or later. If the cost of upgrading to actual fibre to the premises wasn't so outlandish, I'd do it in a heartbeat.",
        "And the 58-year-old says Gordon Strachan has asked him to carry on in his national role should the Scotland boss decide to remain in charge. \"I was really keen to get back into club management, but the destination was important,\" said McGhee. \"It was important I returned at a club close to my heart and was a challenge.\" Motherwell, who sit ninth in the Scottish Premiership, sacked Ian Baraclough last month. McGhee was in charge at Fir Park for two years before leaving to join Aberdeen in 2009. The former Scotland striker, who also managed Reading, Leicester City, Wolves, Millwall, Brighton and Aberdeen, had his last managerial stint at Bristol Rovers in 2012 but lasted less than a year. McGhee, who has been Strachan's assistant since January 2013, said \"I've had several things put to me over the last few years\" in his desire to return to club football. \"I am delighted to be back at Fir Park and Motherwell, a club in which I have a real affection for after some fantastic highs and tragic lows in my last spell,\" he said. McGhee steered Motherwell to a third-place finish and European qualification for the first time in 13 years in his debut season. During his time at Fir Park, he was short-listed for the Scotland manager's post, losing out to George Burley. Asked about inheriting someone else's squad, McGhee said: \"I have done it before and have no worries about that. \"I am not getting ahead of myself here, but I went to Brighton after a few games and we got promoted through the play-offs and I went to Millwall after a few games and won the title.\" As for his targets, he said: \"I think not being in the embarrassing situation they were in last season and scrambling at the end to avoid relegation. \"After that, the expectations have not been defined.\" Youth team coach Stephen Craigan had been appointed on an interim basis while a successor to Baraclough was sought. Majority shareholder Les Hutchison added: \"The football committee have undertaken a very rigorous selection process and considered over 80 applicants and interviewed a very strong shortlist of candidates before making their recommendation to the chairman and myself. \"I was delighted to talk in detail with Mark about the future plans for the club and he demonstrated a real enthusiasm for the task ahead. \"I was pleased he was the unanimous choice of the board.\"",
        "It is more than twice the sum initially estimated in an inquiry into FN staff. The parliament suspects the money went to FN assistants who were not really working for MEPs, but were engaged in FN party work in France. The allegations - denied by the FN - have now gone to French investigators. Ms Le Pen is campaigning for the second-round vote in the presidential election on 7 May. Her rival, liberal centrist Emmanuel Macron, is ahead of her in opinion polls. The alleged fraudulent payments - from 2012 onwards - concern her and several other FN MEPs. The FN is highly critical of the EU, rejecting its liberal, free market agenda. Ms Le Pen says she is the victim of a politically motivated vendetta. What makes Marine Le Pen far right? In depth: Le Pen and rise of National Front The European Parliament is currently withholding half of Ms Le Pen's salary and expenses, as it tries to recoup money it says she owes. Currently the FN has 24 MEPs, France's biggest contingent. Ms Le Pen has refused to answer a summons over the affair in France, citing her immunity as an MEP. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says most voters drawn to the FN are already highly suspicious of the EU, and may not see the alleged fraud as a particularly serious matter. On Tuesday Ms Le Pen stepped aside as FN leader, saying she needed to be above partisan considerations in the presidential election. The FN's new temporary leader is Jean-Francois Jalkh, and he has immediately been caught in a row over a 2000 interview, in which he is quoted as doubting the Nazis' use of Zyklon B cyanide gas to murder Jews and other victims in the death camps. \"I consider it technically impossible - I repeat, impossible - to use it.... in mass murder. Why? Because you have to wait several days before you can decontaminate a place where Zyklon B was used,\" Le Monde quoted him as saying. When Le Monde asked him about the remark he called it \"utter rubbish\" and said he had \"no recollection of that [interview].\" A year ago the FN's founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was fined EUR30,000 (PS25,278; 32,600) for calling the Nazi gas chambers a \"detail\" of World War Two. He was convicted of contesting crimes against humanity. He got the same conviction in 2012 for calling the Nazi occupation of France \"not particularly inhumane.\" Marine, his daughter, drew strong criticism on 9 April when she suggested France was not responsible for a 1942 wartime round-up of 13,000 Jews, who were sent from France to Nazi death camps.",

        "Southampton Solent University made the former X Factor judge a doctor of media for her \"outstanding contribution to the entertainment industry.\" The singer said she had never been to the city but hoped to get an opportunity to visit the university soon. The honorary doctorate was presented at a special ceremony in London. The presentation was made by the university's chancellor in front of an invited audience of staff and students. Ms Minogue said: \"I'm honoured and I'm shocked to receive this degree. \"You start working in the entertainment industry and you don't really stop and look back at what you've done. \"It's nice to be honoured for that and to connect with the students who are studying at the moment because a big part of their studies is having the practical side of working in the industry. You can't learn that from a book.\" A spokesman for the university added: \"We can quite understand the cynical kind of impression [of the award] but it is not the case. \"We would never give a degree to someone without some connection to the university or the work of the university.\" He added that the university specialised in media teaching and had previously awarded honours to people in the industry. Dan Prendergast, president of the students' union at Southampton Solent University, said: \"She is a musical inspiration to many students. \"She has had a long-spanning career and made a big contribution to the music business. \"This is a great opportunity for students to meet someone like this.\" Last month, Minogue's sister Kylie received an honorary degree from Anglia Ruskin University in Chelmsford.

        "The \"cradle of the Arab Spring\" will this time see officials of the former government taking part in the election, prompting interim President Moncef Marzouki to call it a contest between \"supporters of the revolution and supporters of the counter-revolution.\" The system is based on proportional representation, with each of the country's regions having a fixed number of seats based on population. Lists of candidates are drawn up by parties, coalitions and independents and endorsed by the overseeing body, the Independent High Authority for Elections (ISIE). Some five million Tunisians have registered to vote. Candidates must be aged 23 or over and have held Tunisian nationality for at least 10 years. According to ISIE, 49 of newly-registered voters are women. And the 26 January 2014 constitution introduced - for the first time in the Arab world - parity between men and women in elections. The law stipulates that women should comprise 50 of all electoral lists and there must be an equal number of lists headed by women and men. Tunisian women take a'step backwards' Tunisia's election process means that no party is likely to win a majority of seats in the renamed National Assembly. However, political observers agree - in the absence of opinion polls, which are banned during the campaign - that the favourites are the Islamist Ennahda Movement and their secular opponents, the liberal Nidaa Tounes (Tunisia's Call). A number of other parties are in contention, including the centre-ground secular Congress for the Republic (CPR) and secular Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberty (FDTL or Ettakatol) and those led by former officials of Ben Ali's regime. Most candidates claim to have the economy at the heart of their campaign, realising that poverty and unemployment were the main factors that triggered the 14 January revolution in 2011. Ennahda won 89 of 217 seats in 2011 and led a coalition government with CPR and FDTL. It lost power in January following street protests but hopes to make a comeback. It has said it is willing to form a coalition with any other party. Nidaa Tounes wants to rally nationalist and liberal supporters to weaken the position of Ennahda. It was founded by Beji Caid Essebsi, a former transitional prime minister, and enjoys the support of the Tunisian General Labour Union and some business groups. Nidaa says it will not contemplate any coalition with Ennahda until that groups \"clarifies\" its relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East and North Africa. Congress for the Republic (CPR) is led by interim President Marzouki and won 29 seats in 2011. Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties was founded in 1994 by National Constituent Assembly Speaker Mustapha Ben Djaafar. It won 20 seats in 2011. Popular Front is a coalition of five left-wing and Baathist parties led by Hamma Hammami. It played an important role in mobilising street protests to bring down two Ennahda-led governments. The Front parties, however, do not seem to have significant electoral support. The al-Qaeda-affiliated Okba Ibn Nafaa battalion, active on Tunisia's border with Algeria, has threatened to disrupt the election. Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou has said his ministry has plans in hand to deal with the \"terrorist\" threat, which he described as \"serious.\" Tunisia is to mobilize 50,000 security officers and nearly 20,000 soldiers to secure the election. Tunisians have shown only \"lukewarm interest,\" according to al-Jazeera TV on 20 October. Tunisian academic Abdellatif Hanachi told al-Jazeera that this is partly because of the difficult economic and social conditions in the country. He added that voter apathy was due to a \"sense of frustration\" among a broad section of people at the failure to fulfil revolutionary promises. However, he concluded that this could all change on polling day, as it did in 2011. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

        "Gales and heavy rain swept across large parts of the UK, causing devastating flooding in Cumbria and Lancashire, as well as parts of southern Scotland. On the first anniversary of Storm Desmond, experts say November to January were the wettest three months since UK records began in 1910. Review author Terry Marsh said flooding was \"extensive and repetitive.\" Storm Desmond began battering parts of the UK on 5 December, depositing a record month's worth of rain on Cumbria in just one day. About 5,200 homes were flooded in Cumbria and Lancashire, while tens of thousands more lost power after an electricity sub-station in Lancaster was flooded. The storm caused an estimated insurance bill of more than PS1.3bn. Major storms \"Abigail,\" \"Frank\" and \"Gertrude\" also hit the UK last winter. A study by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), in collaboration with the British Hydrological Society, found many rivers across northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland saw record peak flows during the three-month period. It found the rivers Eden, Tyne and Lune in England saw record peaks of around 1,700 cubic metres per second. Experts say such levels could fill London's Royal Albert Hall in less than a minute. Although last winter's floods were more extreme in scale, flooding in 1947 had a greater impact in terms of homes flooded and crops destroyed, the appraisal found. However, lead author Terry Marsh from CEH said the national scale of last winter's floods were \"the most extreme on record.\" \"The associated flooding was both extensive and repetitive, and total river outflows from Great Britain following the passage of Storm Desmond in December exceeded the previous maximum by a substantial margin,\" he said.",
        "The Real Madrid forward headed the vital goal in Cyprus as Wales won 1-0 in Nicosia and stay top of Group B. With the top two qualifying for France, three more points will be enough to seal Wales' place at a major finals for the first time since 1958. \"We've never done it so I'm guessing it's going to be hard,\" Bale said. \"But this group is focused, we really know what we need to do and hopefully we can deliver on Sunday. Media playback is not supported on this device \"It would probably be the best thing we've achieved. If we can get across the line it'll be an amazing thing, not just for us but the whole nation and the whole of Welsh football. \"We know what's coming. All out attention has been focused on the Cyprus game, we haven't thought about the Israel game at all. \"That's the good thing about this team, we haven't taken our eyes off the ball once.\" Wales had not won in Cyprus since 1992 and as chances came and went in Nicosia on Thursday it seemed as though they would be denied once again. But with eight minutes remaining on the clock, Jazz Richards picked out Bale and the 26-year-old met the ball with a thumping header that gave the excellent Antonis Georgallides in the Cyprus goal no chance. \"I've not scored too many better [headers] and at a vital time, which was important,\" added Bale. \"Obviously it wasn't our best performance in terms of attacking but we defended well as a unit and showed again what a good team we are. \"We try to defend as a team from front to back, but the backline were incredible. In the end we deserved to win, we created the better chances.\" Wales boss Chris Coleman said that Joe Ledley remained a \"huge doubt\" for Sunday's match against Israel with the hamstring problem that saw the Crystal Palace midfielder miss out in Cyprus. But West Bromwich Albion defender James Chester has a chance of playing after his hamstring injury kept him out in Nicosia. West Ham United's James Collins is another option at the heart of defence. But after the performance of skipper Ashley Williams, Chris Gunter and Ben Davies in Nicosia, Wales manager Chris Coleman may be unwilling to tinker with his winning formula. Former Wales captain Kevin Ratcliffe: \"We kept it nice and tight at the back and weren't chasing things. \"Cyprus had a lot of possession in the second half but never really got in behind us and hurt us. \"I was a little bit concerned down the left-hand side on one or two occasions and I think a better side might have exploited that. \"We've got to rectify that for the next game, because Israel would have seen that we're lacking left-sided players with the nous to get across the pitch on a consistent basis. We are lacking that with Joe Ledley not in the squad. \"But we are resilient at the back: Chris Gunter and Ashley Williams were immense along with Jazz Richards, who was so comfortable in that position. \"One goal is enough the way we defend.\"",
        "Inspired by the lily pond in Monet's garden at Giverny in France, the painting was the top lot at Sotheby's sale of modern and impressionist works. It totalled just under PS122m, including PS15.2m for Piet Mondrian's 1927 Composition with Red, Blue and Grey. Sotheby's said it proved collectors are still keen to acquire \"trophy art.\" Paintings by Sisley, Picasso, Manet and Kandinsky were also among the 46 works, with only four pieces failing to find buyers as many sold close to the top end of the pre-auction estimates and sometimes above. \"The Nympheas selling for such a huge sum is again a reflection that this is still a market that is driven by trophies, that the great works by the major masters are still really sought after,\" said Philip Hook from Sotheby's. The auction house said the bidding for the Monet work attracted buyers from Asia and all over the world and went on for 10 minutes, going up in PS250,000 increments in its final stages. It said the painting, from the \"most iconic and celebrated of Monet's painting series, can be counted among the artist's greatest achievements.\" It once belonged to Paul Durand-Ruel, the legendary art dealer who championed the Impressionists and represented Monet. The same work had been offered for auction in 2010 but failed to reach its reserve price. Sotheby's said this time it had carried a more \"realistic\" estimate of PS20m to PS30m. The sale price of PS31.7m included a buyer's premium. Two other Monet paintings were also offered in the sale, La Seine a Argenteuil which sold for PS8.5m and Antibes, vue du plateau Notre-Dame, which sold for PS7.9m.",
        "After a dreadful first-half showing, Spurs improved and the Wales left-back found the breakthrough against their Championship opponents with a deft header. Son Heung-min then wrapped up the victory when he converted Moussa Sissoko's pass to put Mauricio Pochettino's side in Monday's fourth-round draw. Tottenham have moved into third place in the Premier League on the back of a five-match winning run, but their second string struggled to click against a Villa side set out to frustrate. Without the rested Dele Alli, Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen, the hosts were short of ideas and the tie looked destined for a replay until unlikely goalscorer Davies arrived inside the penalty area. Villa mustered one shot on target all game and Steve Bruce will now turn his attention to overhauling a seven-point gap to the Championship play-off places. Tottenham were excellent in beating Premier League leaders Chelsea 2-0 in midweek, but perhaps unsurprisingly were nowhere near that level in the opening hour. Of the XI who started against Chelsea, only Toby Alderweireld and Eric Dier kept their places - and it showed. Alli, Kane and Eriksen had contributed 30 of Spurs' 51 goals this season, and 11 of 33 assists, before kick-off and without them Pochettino's side looked toothless. Stand-in striker Vincent Janssen, who has scored just three penalties in 23 appearances now, was particularly lightweight and it was only when Alli finally replaced him after an hour that Tottenham found a way through. It was another replacement, Georges-Kevin Nkoudou, who crossed for Davies to head home before Son - who had moved up front once Janssen went off - buried the second. A top-four finish remains Pochettino's most pressing assignment, but after a dismal Champions League campaign a first FA Cup win since 1991 should also be high on his list. More to follow.

        "After seeing the Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield performing with his guitar or Scott Kelly of Nasa doing airborne somersaults, many might wonder if the ISS has a serious point. The reality is that everyone sent up there faces a very busy timetable which involves managing a range of experiments that make use of the state of weightlessness. The space station is a giant laboratory and every inhabitant is expected to get involved in the research. Just by being in space, Tim himself will serve as a lab rat, allowing his body to be monitored in great detail - with 23 different sets of measurements in all. By the end of his mission, he will be all too familiar with the regular processes of gathering samples of his blood and urine. Space research is not for the squeamish. But if there is ever to be a long trek through space to Mars or even beyond, medical knowledge of how humans cope will be essential. So some of the research is aimed specifically at gaining new insights that will benefit future generations of spacefarers while other experiments are designed to have a relevance to life here on Earth. One European Space Agency project is investigating the properties of metals in a level of detail that cannot be matched down on the ground because of the influence of gravity. Prof Mike Cruise of the University of Birmingham, who chairs ESA's human spaceflight science advisory committee, told me that the work \"sounds really obscure but could have quite an effect on all our lives.\" Until now, any analysis of how metals behave is almost guaranteed to be undermined because gravity will force the sample to touch the walls of whatever container is being used and that means it will collect impurities. So the Electromagnetic Levitator experiment - in the European Columbus module - has a clever technique for allowing blobs of metal to be heated and then cooled while being suspended in the air. While this happens, measurements are made of the characteristics of the metal, all without the complicating effects of gravity risking the integrity of the research. Prof Cruise said: \"If you look around your car, it probably has 20 or even 40 items made by casting molten metal into a mold - a process that requires huge knowledge of the properties, of how sticky or viscous the metal might be. \"If we got better measurements, our casting could become far more efficient with fewer parts with holes in them - this seemingly innocuous experiment that could have a pretty huge industrial impacts.\" So the aim is to generate a far better understanding of key materials, and scientists from the Universities of Greenwich and Leeds are among those making use of the results. Another project, called Fluid Shifts and managed by Nasa, is exploring the question of pressure within the brain. Astronauts have often reported problems with their vision and the assumption is that this is the result of fluids shifting within the body and particularly moving towards the head. Researchers at University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust have found a connection between the brain and the ear, and a better grasp of how this process works could help with a new technique for assessing brain pressure by taking measurements in the ear. A UK company, Marchbanks Measurements Systems, has come up with a device that can detect slight changes in the inner ear. The company's founder Dr Robert Marchbanks told us:\" It is crucial to the understanding of how brain pressure changes. It is a different environment, there is no gravity but that is important to our understanding of brain pressure.\" And while some research is aimed at improving human health, another focus is on helping answer the fundamental question of whether we are alone in the universe. Since micro-organisms such as bacteria have been found thriving in the most inhospitable corners of Earth - from the deep-frozen Antarctic to boiling hydrothermal vents - the next step is to explore how they cope with space. If it is the case that life got started here because rudimentary forms of it were delivered by a colliding asteroid or comet, the obvious question is whether it is possible that life-forms could survive in an icy vacuum or fiery descent through the atmosphere. So a series of experiments called Expose, involving the University of Edinburgh, places different organisms outside the space station to see their response to cosmic rays, solar radiation and intense temperature changes. It is only in the last three to four years that the ISS has been able to host so much research. Financial problems, and the loss of the US space shuttle Columbia in 2003, meant that construction took far longer than planned - and for years the few crew on board could spare little time for science. That has now changed and the first results from ISS experiments are being released, but it is still early days to judge the space station's value to research. Prof Cruise said: \"There is a lot of good science. It's not all headline Nobel Prize work, but the nature of the experiments means it would never get into Nobel territory. \"It's going to take us another five years or so to judge what that scientific contribution has been.\" The ISS was conceived at the end of the Cold War as a way of cementing friendship between the United States and Russia and to keep Russian scientists from being lured away to countries such as Iran. Now it's become a platform for international research, and a novice British astronaut will play his part. Tim Peake in space: Want to know more?

        "The ska group tweeted the news: \"It is with deep regret that we say goodbye to our great friend, the world's greatest drummer, our beloved Brad. RIP.\" Bradbury joined The Specials in 1979, and continued with the reversioned band The Special AKA, who had a top 10 hit with Free Nelson Mandela. Bradbury took part in The Specials reunion tour in 2009. He also headed up a band called JB Allstars. The band's representatives said the drummer died in England but no cause of death was given. In a statement, his family said: \"It is with deepest regret that we have to announce the very sad news that our much loved husband and father John'Brad' Bradbury passed away on Monday the 28 of December. \"Brad's drumming was the powerhouse behind The Specials and it was seen as a key part to the Two Tone sound. He was much respected in the world of drumming and his style of reggae and ska was seen as genuinely ground-breaking when The Specials first hit the charts in 1979. \"He was an integral part of The Specials reforming in 2008 and toured with them extensively up to the present day. His contribution to the world of music can not be understated and he will much missed by family, friends and fans alike. \"It is the family's sincerest wish that they are allowed the time to remember him privately.\" The news comes three months after the band's trombonist, Rico Rodriguez, died. The band, famed for their 1960s mod-style outfits, had seven UK top 10 singles including Too Much Too Young and Ghost Town. Founder and songwriter Jerry Dammers dissolved the band in 1981 but they re-grouped and continue to perform and record without their former leading man. Billy Bragg was one of the first musicans to pay tribute to Bradbury.: \"A bad day for good music. First we lose Lemmy, now news that Brad from the Specials has passed away. RIP.\" Bradbury was born and brought up in Coventry where the band was formed in 1977. Music producer Pete Waterman, also from Coventry, expressed his shock at the news of the Bradbury's death. Speaking to BBC Coventry and Warwickshire, Waterman said: \"I always had a good laugh with Brad. He was always proud of being in the band and what we'd and he'd achieved. \"He never left Coventry because he always wanted to be part of the scene.... he was tremendous.\"",
        "\"Parents no longer have the certainty when they send their child to school that they will be taught by qualified teachers,\" says NASUWT leader Chris Keates. Labour's Tristram Hunt says \"this is nothing less than a scandal.\" But the Conservatives say there are fewer teachers in school without qualified status than in 2010. The NASUWT teachers' union, holding its annual conference in Cardiff, will hear claims that more teachers without qualified teacher status are being used in schools. The union has asked its members about their experiences. Among the 4,600 who responded 61 said they were \"working alongside unqualified staff,\" with 66 claiming the situation was \"deteriorating\" because of funding problems. \"This is jeopardising the educational progress of children,\" said Ms Keates who attacked the use of unqualified staff as a \"crude cost-cutting measure.\" Teachers responding to the union's survey included comments such as: \"They lack any training in classroom management and discipline\" and \"I feel that parents are being misled by the quality of teaching within the school.\" The use of unqualified teachers has become a general election issue. Labour has campaigned against allowing academies and free schools to employ teachers who do not have qualified teacher status or who are training towards being qualified. \"The rising number of unqualified teachers in our schools shows yet again that the Tory plan is threatening standards and failing children and working families,\" said shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt. \"David Cameron has removed the requirement for teachers to be qualified, and as a result over 400,000 children are now being taught by unqualified teachers without receiving training in skills vital to the profession such as classroom discipline, safeguarding and how to deliver effective teaching for all children.\" The Liberal Democrats also want to require teachers to have qualified status. But both Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives say there were more unqualified teachers in schools when Labour were in power. They reject the suggestion that the use of unqualified teachers is increasing. A Conservative party spokesman said: \"The number of teachers without qualified status has gone down since 2010. And we need to keep this in perspective - only 3.7 of teachers are'unqualified'. \"But most importantly, we've given head teachers more freedom over the teachers they employ because we trust them to know what is best for their schools. \"There are some brilliant teachers who have not got qualified teacher status - nuns, great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists that inspire their pupils. They may have worked in the independent sector or have experience in the outside world.\" A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats said they would \"change the law to guarantee a qualified teacher in every classroom.\" \"Teaching must be recognised as the vitally important and high status profession that it is, able to attract and retain the very best people.\" \"It is good news that there are now fewer unqualified teachers working in schools than under the previous Labour government. However, every child deserves to be taught by a qualified teacher, regardless of what type of school they attend.\" The most recent Department for Education figures available, for 2013, show the number of unqualified teachers rose compared with the previous year, from 14,800 to 17,100, but is lower than in 2010, when there were 17,800 of teachers without qualified teacher status. However for academies, the proportion of unqualified teachers has risen each year since 2010, from 2,200 to 7,900.",

        "The latest MarkitCIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.7 last month, down from January's reading of 55.6. Any figure above 50 means expansion, but the rise in service sector activity was the weakest since March 2013. The service sector accounts for more than three-quarters of the UK economy. Surveys from MarkitCIPS earlier in the week put the manufacturing sector's PMI at 50.8 and construction at 54.2. \"The weaker increase in services activity mainly reflected a slower expansion in the volume of incoming new business,\" the survey said. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson added: \"Survey responses reveal that firms are worried about signs of faltering demand, but boardrooms have also become unsettled by concerns regarding the increased risk of'Brexit', financial market volatility and weak economic growth at home and abroad.\" He added that the extent of the slowdown would come as a \"shock\" to policymakers and would put an end to talk of a possible interest rate rise. Mr Williamson described February's three PMI readings as \"a triple whammy of disappointing survey news.\" Last week, official figures confirmed that the UK economy grew 0.5 in the final three months of 2015, with the services sector highlighted as the key factor driving growth. The Office for National Statistics said the \"buoyancy\" of services had offset the \"relative sluggishness\" of the rest of the UK economy. Signs of weakening growth in the UK economy have pushed back estimates of when the Bank of England might begin to raise interest rates. Commenting on the latest PMI survey, Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, said: \"The May Bank of England meeting had previously been seen as a possible time for a rate hike. The volatility of global markets and the self-inflicted wound of the EU referendum put paid to that months ago. \"We still believe, however, that some measures that foresee the Bank of England holding rates at 0.5 until 2020 are little short of absurd.\" Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the PMI readings would provide \"plenty of food for thought\" for the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. He added: \"Members will have to judge the degree to which the surveys are flagging a genuine slowdown in activity growth, or merely reacting to the negative headlines since the start of the year. In reality, growth may be softening, but perhaps not as sharply as the survey data suggest.\" Meanwhile, a similar survey indicated that eurozone businesses had their worst month for more than a year in February, bolstering the case for more monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank. Markit's final composite PMI, which is regarded as a good guide to growth, fell to 53 last month from January's 53.6 - its lowest reading since the start of 2015. However, that was better than the preliminary reading of 52.7 and well above the 50 mark that denotes growth.",
        "The 25-year-old midfielder had received approaches from Scottish Premiership rivals Dundee United and Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Manager Alan Archibald said: \"Steven has proved over the last few seasons what a valuable part of the squad he is. \"It came as no surprise that Steven had offers from other Premiership clubs.\" Lawless, who joined Thistle from Motherwell in 2012, made 40 appearances this season, scoring five goals. Thistle are also waiting to hear from Frederic Francs and Gary Miller after contract offers to the defenders. Caley Thistle, who finished two places above the Glasgow side in seventh, had also made approaches to Lawless' midfield team-mates, Stuart Bannigan and Abdul Osman.

        "Stocktrade is being transferred to the Dundee-headquartered firm for PS14m in cash. Its most recent annual revenue was PS9m, with PS1.3m in pre-tax profit. Last September, Stocktrade had PS4.3bn of assets under management. The buyer said it now stands at PS4.6bn, bringing 48,000 new customers. That should increase the scale of Alliance Trust Savings to PS11.5bn in assets under management, with 105,000 customers, allowing for more efficient operations. It will also increase the Dundonians range of services, including telephone and online share dealing services for pension providers, building societies, company share schemes and corporate Individual Savings Accounts. Brewin Dolphin said the sale would only clear a net gain of PS1m, after paying for separation costs. The deal still requires clearance from regulators, and is expected to close during this year. Alliance Trust Savings was part of the strategy last month criticised by Elliott Advisers, the hedge fund and activist investor in parent company Alliance Trust. In criticising the Dundee company's management, it succeeded in getting two new directors appointed. They could have sought to block further expansion of the financial retail platform. But it appears, from this deal, that they have agreed to expenditure on growth. Alliance Trust believes that the expansion could help its savings division into profit by 2016, apart from the cost of integration. Patrick Mill, managing director of Alliance Trust Savings (ATS), said: \"Stocktrade is a great strategic fit for ATS, giving us access to new customers, an increase in assets and the opportunity to build a strategic partnership capability. \"It also gives us the ability to align a traditional stockbroking business with our innovative, scalable and cost effective approach by offering customers online access alongside our in-house customer service team.\"",
        "Sharnford Traffic Action Group (STAG) said some motorists were clocked at \"eye watering\" speeds topping 100mph. It has campaigned against dangerous driving on Aston Lane and the B4114 in Leicestershire for more than 10 years. The county council has offered to install speed bumps on Aston Lane at a cost of PS12,000 to the parish council. More on this story and other news in Leicestershire Motorists have been recorded by the village's speed monitor, which is moved around Sharnford - located near Hinckley and about 11 miles (17.7 km) from Leicester. STAG, which owns the monitor, sends the speeds of the vehicles to Leicestershire Police and the county council every month. It said according to its data, more than 13,000 motorists drove above 50mph in a 30mph zone in the past year and about 562,000 since November 2015. In the space of about 15 months, a total of 2.75m vehicles travelled through the village and about one in five - around 21 - were speeding, the data suggested. The group claims that if they had the powers to fine drivers the charges would total PS5.6m. Sharnford parish councillor Mike Shirley, secretary of STAG, said: \"The eye-watering figures demonstrate the inarguable need for proper, enforceable speed monitoring 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in the interests of safety.\" He added that homes have been damaged, lampposts and signs felled and pedestrians knocked over by lorries trying to navigate the narrow streets. Leicestershire County Council said their own speed survey showed the village would \"not qualify\" for speed cameras and it cannot afford to build a bypass without government funding.",

        "A foul smell led residents to the site in March. The government says all the bodies were buried in a single night and include stillborn babies and unclaimed bodies. But Human Rights Watch says they must check to see if any of the people killed during anti-government protests in January have been buried there. Dozens of demonstrators died in protests over a proposed electoral law change which would have required a national census to be held before the presidential election could take place. The US-based watchdog Human Rights Watch (HWR) has said that bodies went missing during the protests and also during government crackdowns on criminal gangs in the capital last year and in 2013. Human rights workers first became aware of the burial site after residents of Maluku in Kinshasa reported a terrible smell near the local cemetery more than two weeks ago. A woman working in the field then discovered a limb sticking out of the ground. The DR Congo government has said that the bodies were all buried in individual graves on 19 March. A spokesman said on Monday that there would be no exhumations of the bodies.",
        "Jim McCafferty, 71, appeared before Belfast Magistrates' Court charged with eight counts of touching a boy under the age of 16. The crimes are alleged to have happened in Belfast between 2012 and 2015. Mr McCafferty, who previously lived in Glasgow and worked at Celtic more than 20 years ago, was arrested last December. He was also a kit man for other Scottish clubs, including Falkirk and Hibernian, before moving to Northern Ireland about seven years ago. Mr McCafferty, who now has an address at Raby Street in south Belfast, has been on remand at Maghaberry Prison amid fears for his safety. He was escorted into the dock on a walking frame for the hearing at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Thursday. Dressed in a white T-shirt and and grey tracksuit bottoms, the pensioner spoke to confirm he understood the allegations against him. The judge ordered his trial to be held at Belfast Crown Court on a date to be fixed. No application for bail was made and he is expected to remain in custody until the proceedings get underway.",

        "The higher education sector largely supported remaining in the UK and since the vote, has voiced concerns about the financial implications of leaving. Universities fear losing research funding, students and staff in the event of a \"hard\" Brexit. But some universities are considering expanding into Europe as a way round the problem. The University of Kent has had a centre in Brussels for almost 20 years, for more than 200 postgraduate students from 60 countries, and also runs branches in Paris, Athens and Rome. These sites are recognised by relevant legal and educational authorities in each country and allow the university \"to develop and foster connections that enable our students to gain important access to professional networks,\" said a University of Kent spokesman. Other universities could follow suit as Brexit negotiations gather pace. \"You can imagine a situation post-Brexit where UK universities are operating as aggressively in Europe as they are in China and India and elsewhere, Chris Husbands, vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, told the Guardian newspaper. There is evidence that UK universities are already losing out on research collaboration with European partners. British universities, in collaboration with small businesses, receive PS850m in research grants each year from the European Union. Universities also worry that they would find it harder to recruit students and staff from EU countries if freedom of movement restrictions were brought in and the rules on fees for EU students were changed under the UK's new relationship with the EU. EU students currently pay the same fees and have the same access to loans as UK students - and Universities UK president Dame Julia Goodfellow has already called for reassurance for those who have already started degrees at UK universities that these arrangements will last for the duration of their courses. Branches within the EU could allow UK universities to retain research links and European funding while also allowing them to continue to attract staff and students. The Guardian quotes one vice-chancellor as saying that institutions were \"window shopping\" for the EU countries with the most co-operative regulatory regimes. Germany, Finland, the Republic of Ireland and the Baltic states are said to be emerging as the preferred options of some universities. Alistair Jarvis, deputy chief executive of Universities UK, said British universities faced \"significant challenges.\" \"British universities can thrive post-exit with the right support from government,\" said Mr Jarvis. \"To thrive post-exit, we need government to take action to make the UK an even more attractive destination for talented university staff and students from around the world and develop new policies and funding to enhance international research collaboration.\" Oxford University says it has no plans to expand overseas, though vice-chancellor Louise Richardson has voiced concerns about losing staff to other countries. \"Our academics might decide to leave if they're concerned that they may not be able to get their research funded in the future. \"There are many universities in the world who would be thrilled to have them and who are approaching them,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has told the BBC that formal negotiations to leave the EU will probably begin early in 2017.",
        "Ivan Cameron, who had cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died in hospital aged six in February 2009. Mrs Cameron told the Times: \"Ive dying is such a massive thing that everything else is irrelevant.\" She also said it changed her husband's outlook. \"I think it changed Dave's politics. It made him understanding, though he couldn't be too subjective.\" David Cameron had been an MP for less than a year when Ivan was born in 2002, and became prime minister the year after Ivan died. Mrs Cameron said: \"From the moment he is born, you are living in a situation that is quite surreal and difficult to deal with. \"It is intense every day, in and out of hospitals.... in a way, that prepared me for Dave being prime minister, because I was used to living and operating in a way that's not normal.\" When Ivan died, she said, the outside world \"became meaningless.\" \"Like anyone else in my situation, I just kept going. You have to deal with it, because you have no choice.\" The Camerons have three other children; Nancy, born in 2004; Arthur, born in 2006; and Florence, born in 2010. Mrs Cameron also spoke about her family's life in Downing Street. \"We tried to make the flat feel like a home. \"Dave would be combing the children's hair for nits before giving a speech in the evening.\" They got their groceries delivered because there was no supermarket nearby - and if she forgot butter, she would have to go to a shop in Trafalgar Square. \"So I did plan quite carefully.\" She also said she dreaded the official holiday photograph. \"At the last minute we would panic and think,'Oh God, it's the holiday photo... \"I hated the holding-hands thing because it looked too romantic, so we overdid the cups-of-coffee-looking-wistful pose.\" Mrs Cameron was speaking to the Times Magazine to promote her clothing brand Cefinn.

        "The 30-year-old is to remain there following the completion of a psychiatric report. Belfast Magistrates' Court was told she would not be able to leave without the hospital's permission. The woman cannot be named amid claims that identifying her would increase the risk of her taking her own life. A press challenge to the temporary reporting restrictions is due to be heard next month. The woman was arrested by detectives investigating the child's death following an incident in Belfast in March. She was charged with murder and then held under the Mental Health Act. Her barrister revealed on Wednesday that a medical report had now been prepared. Based on its contents he sought a termination of the current arrangements for keeping his client at the facility. \"The application is that she be remanded on bail, subject to the condition that she continues to reside (there),\" he said. A doctor who assessed the accused confirmed that the health trust consented to the proposal, provided the accused was there as a detained person. The judge was informed that under those arrangements the woman would not be able to leave. Granting the application, she listed the criminal proceedings for a further update in eight weeks time.",

        "Robinson led the club back to the Premiership in May, ending their seven-year stay in the Championship. But Bristol have lost all seven top-flight games so far this season, leaving them bottom of the table. The 52-year-old former England and Scotland head coach has been in charge at Bristol since 2013. Robinson only signed a new three-year contract with the Ashton Gate side in August, but they have since lost all nine of their competitive fixtures - including two in the European Challenge Cup. A club statement said: \"Bristol Rugby have decided, following the extremely disappointing start to the season, to appoint Mark Tainton as acting head coach with immediate effect.\" Kicking coach Tainton, who joined Bristol prior to the start of the season, has previously worked at London Irish, Wasps and for the Ireland national team coaching staff. \"This is clearly a very difficult time for the club, but we remain confident we can retain our position in the Premiership,\" added Bristol chairman Chris Booy. Since Bristol's long-awaited return to the top flight began with an encouraging 21-19 loss at Harlequins on the opening day, both results and performances have failed to meet expectations. A heavy 70-22 defeat at Wasps on 18 September set the tone for a defence which has conceded 34 tries in seven league games. Injuries have undoubtedly hampered Robinson's side, with 15 senior players ruled out of October's Challenge Cup loss at local rivals Bath. Long-term absentees have included influential former Wales centre Gavin Henson, who was forced off injured in both of his two appearances this season, including Sunday's 31-13 home defeat by Sale Sharks. BBC Radio 5 live rugby union reporter Chris Jones \"Bristol spent seven seasons down in the Championship, so it's no surprise that they have acted swiftly following their chastening start to their Premiership campaign. \"Although the club say Robinson is suspended, not sacked, it's hard to see him returning to take charge of team affairs, and it's likely the suspension is a case of negotiating severance. \"Mark Tainton will be acting head coach while a review is carried out, with Bristol needing a dramatic upturn in their fortunes on the pitch to avoid an immediate return to the second tier.\"",

        "The 22-year-old, who is on a season-long loan at Turkish side Kasimpasa from Chelsea, has been told by the team doctor he needs time to recover. \"I feel sad about it as it was another good opportunity for me to represent my country,\" Omeruo told BBC Sport. \"The doctor insists I need rest to start next season without injury.\" Omeruo was first called up by Nigeria in January 2013 and he went on to play at that year's Africa Cup of Nations and Confederations Cup - and at the 2014 World Cup. He admitted he was looking forward to playing at the Games, especially after the Super Eagles' failure to qualify for the 2015 and 2017 African Cup of Nations. \"It is disappointing and frustrating to say the least. I'd be lying if I said I would not want to be out there playing,\" he said. \"But at the same time I need to be fully fit to be at my best and I have no doubt that the squad will do great in Brazil. \"I would also like to thank the coach [Samson Siasia] for even considering me in the first place.\" A firm fixture in the Kasimpasa side, such has been Omeruo's impact that the Turkish club are now exploring the option to buy him at the end of his loan spell. He joined Chelsea from Belgian side Standard Liege in 2012 and developed on loan at ADO Den Haag in Netherlands in an 18-month spell from 2012 to 2013. The centre-back, who is yet to make his competitive debut for Chelsea, then went on loan to Championship side Middlesbrough in January 2014 and made 14 appearances. He returned to Teesside again for the whole of 201415 season where he made 22 appearances.",
        "Pierre Cornlouer from Tredegar spent 30 years in the Navy, serving in the Falklands, the Gulf and Bosnia. He wrote The Adventures of Mrs Orangeleaf to explain to his daughter what life was like for servicemen. An animation of it is narrated by Simon Weston and voiced by 40 other veterans. They are all aged 20 to 85, with many of them people Mr Cornlouer has met in his role as chaplain for the Alabare charity - which helps those struggling to cope with life outside the military. The Armed Forces Covenant funded the animation and radio play adaptations and they will be premiered in Portsmouth to coincide with the 35th anniversary of the Falklands conflict later this year. Mr Cornlouer said recording them helped many veterans \"feel part of something\" for the first time since leaving the forces. \"My daughter asked'what are you doing daddy?' when I spoke to her [while away]. I replied'giving Benjamin [HMS] Illustrious his breakfast',\" he said. \"I described oil sandwiches, Norman the Harrier taking off from it and lights on the Hormuz strait between Iraq and Iran being pirates.\" Trying to explain to a child what he was experiencing was the inspiration behind him putting pen to paper. He was an assistant steward on the QE2 after it was commandeered to take soldiers to the Falklands when the conflict over the South Atlantic British colony broke out with Argentina in 1982. \"We got to know many of them and gave them a can of beer [as they got off] and wished them luck,\" he said. \"But then we had to pick up survivors from the Coventry and Antelope [British boats that had been bombed] and realised the Galahad [another ship] had also been hit. \"We lost some of them. That is when we realised the nature of the war.\" While flashbacks of what he saw, such as the badly injured servicemen he helped, can be triggered any time such as through television shows, his books give a different perspective of the conflict. Instead of the horrors, details on the Falklands War are limited to a story about \"two penguins, a seal and a ship stuck on ice.\" Mrs Orangeleaf and the Pirates has sold 10,000 copies, while he has written two others, including Mrs Orangeleaf Goes to Santa's rescue - based loosely on the Army helping out after floods hit England over Christmas 2013. \"The idea is to let children and adults know that the Army, Navy and air force don't go around killing people,\" he said. \"You see on the news stories about places like Syria and some things are very graphic. \"There are messages in the book, like don't bully people, with a liar on the ship getting the worst jobs and details of the humanitarian work.\" Through his chaplaincy work, he runs coffee mornings for veterans around south Wales. He said being able to joke and make light of things they had experienced was part of the \"healing process\" for many ex-servicemen, with the project being an extension of that. Mr Cornlouer added: \"A lot of people come out of the forces and find life difficult. Their children can just see daddy has been in a war and is not very happy. \"But a soldier is a human being and they are just valleys guys. This [Mrs Orangeleaf] can hopefully mean they can explain things better and are film stars instead.\" Veterans taking part include Alice Robinson, who was in the Women's Royal Army Corps, who is the voice of Mrs Orangeleaf. Falklands veteran Simon Weston, whom Mr Cornlouer met on the QE2, agreed to narrate the animation. \"It is nice for all veterans to get together. One thing they miss is the camaraderie,\" he said. \"This works tremendously well - when they stop acting, they have a laugh.\" His words were echoed by Barry Edwards, a former corporal in the Royal Regiment of Wales, who met Mr Cornlouer at Alabare's Pontypridd's accommodation for veterans who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. He believes involvement in Mrs Orangeleaf has been \"inspiring\" for many who served in the Falklands, Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. \"This has shown that the teamwork and comradeship still exists now as it did then,\" Mr Edwards said. \"It has allowed teamwork to flourish and banter to prevail, it has allowed the veterans to have a sense of belonging.\"",

        "The deaths plunged the community in the town of Arnstein into mourning. The five young men and a woman, all aged 18 or 19, were found on Sunday by the landowner whose son and daughter were among the victims. Police say a wood-burning stove was in use at the hut, but other possible causes are still being investigated. \"The six adolescents.... died from carbon monoxide poisoning,\" said a police statement. \"The cause of the leakage of the toxic gas remains under investigation.\" The owner of the hut said he had gone there after his children failed to return from the party the night before. A neighbour told German media that his daughter had been celebrating her 18th birthday. The brick building is some distance outside the town and the area was covered in snow.

        "In Tanzania, campaigning for the October general election began on Sunday. In Uganda, President Museveni and his National Resistance Movement are getting ready to battle it out with the opposition in the run-up to elections in 2016. While Rwandans are taking initial steps to change their constitution to increase the presidential term limit to three, across the border in Burundi President Pierre Nkurunziza is faced with dangerous tensions stirred up by his recent re-election. Here in Kenya, elections are still two years away, but it already feels like campaign season has begun. With all this election activity, it's inevitable that the five countries comprising the East African Community (EAC) - Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi will learn lessons from one another - both good and bad. For example, President Nkurunziza of Burundi learnt from Rwanda that it's OK to seek a third term of office if the first two were short and sweet. But unlike Rwanda, where they're planning a national referendum on the issue, Burundi's leader forgot to ask the people if they were OK with it. Meanwhile in Uganda, President Museveni can't see what all the fuss is about. By his thinking, if the people love you, it's fine to clear away any obstacles that might prevent them from expressing that love, like for example, term limits, which were removed from Uganda's constitution a decade ago. In Tanzania, the opposition has decided to learn a big lesson from Kenya. After trying and failing many times to remove President Moi and his ruling Kanu party from power, the Kenyan opposition figured that if they rallied behind only one presidential candidate, Kanu would fall. And sure enough in 2002, all the main opposition parties threw their weight behind Mwai Kibaki, under the national rainbow coalition. Kanu came tumbling down and President Moi went into retirement. Now, it's Tanzania's turn to try the same tactic. After weeks of discussions, the main opposition parties, who adopted the umbrella name of Ukawa, have finally agreed to support only one presidential candidate. His name is Edward Lowassa, a former prime minister in the ruling CCM party. Until recently, he could still be heard singing the ruling party's praises, only to have a change of heart and join the opposition when his presidential ambitions in the CCM were frustrated. Mr Lowassa appears to have learnt survival skills from Amama Mbabazi in Uganda. Like Mr Lowasaa, Mr Mbabazi is also a former prime minister. Just as Mr Lowassa was a close ally of Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete, Mr Mbabazi had been the right-hand man to Uganda's President Museveni since the 1970s. And like Mr Lowassa, Mr Mbabazi was dropped as prime minister. So for both men, when their thirst for power could not be quenched within the party, they decided to seek a refreshing drink from outside. Mr Mbabazi has now said he wants to run for president as an independent candidate in the Ugandan elections, although his arrest in July while preparing to go and canvass support showed that any campaign he attempts is likely to be fraught with challenges. As its name suggests, the ruling National Resistance Movement in Uganda has a habit of resisting things. And people. Next door in Kenya, there's lots of talk about what's going on in Rwanda. Both countries are going to the polls in 2017. One Kenyan on social media, who opposed moves to clear the way for President Kagame's third term, found himself personally rebuked by the Rwandan leader. Kenyans rushed to defend their insulted compatriot, using the hashtag SomeoneTellKagame to launch their rebuttals. Rwanda has welcomed Kenyan expertise in many sectors of its economy, but politics is one lesson it's not too keen to learn from its neighbour, which has had its own serious problems when it comes to running elections. So, however much East Africans are listening to one another, it seems as though there are still many who are happy to ignore their neighbours and continue doing their own thing.",
        "No-one is absolutely certain it will happen, but most people I've spoken to assume it's coming. In reality, the Americans will just tell everyone what they want and when they want it. I'm told that European governments don't get much say in the matter or much notice of any changes - in fact they're watching the media and Twitter just in case it's sprung on them. Any ban would hit Heathrow the hardest. Three-quarters of UK flights to the US go from Heathrow. That's 761 planes a week, by far the most from any European airport. However, there is widespread concern that by tackling one threat, terrorism, the Americans could be fuelling another, even more serious problem. Fire. If lithium-ion batteries are damaged or short-circuited they make a hell of a bang. It could even be enough to bring down a plane. Captain John Cox is as knowledgeable as anyone you will meet when it comes to plane fires. The former pilot and member of the Royal Aeronautical Society has studied them for more than a decade and now travels the world advising operators, manufacturers and regulators. \"Bunching lots of electronic devices together into the same secure box in the hold is the worst possible thing you could do,\" he told me. \"Devices collected together will dramatically increase the ferocity of any fire.\" Aircraft holds do have fire extinguishers and limited oxygen, but that doesn't help when it comes to lithium battery fires. \"The cargo hold extinguisher will put out the open flame but it will reignite. Lithium battery fires produce their own oxygen as a by-product of thermal runaway, and that keeps the fire going,\" says Mr Cox. Thermal runaway is the process whereby the fire spreads from one battery cell to the next. Once it gets going it's impossible to stop. And the more cells you have bunched together, the bigger the fire. Catching the fire early and stopping thermal runaway is critical. The best device for doing that remains an old fashioned, well-trained human being. Airline staff practise what to do: you put the battery into water if you can. Or wet towels. No-one can do that if it's in the hold. Steve Landells is the safety expert at the British Airline Pilots Association, \"Given the risk of fire from these devices when they are damaged or they short circuit, an incident in the cabin would be spotted earlier and this would enable the crew to react quickly before any fire becomes uncontainable,\" he says. \"If these devices are kept in the hold, the risk is that if a fire occurs the results can be catastrophic; indeed, there have been two crashes where lithium batteries have been cited in the accident reports.\" Mr Cox says that balancing the different risks is complex and needs a thorough assessment from a range of experts. But along with many others in the industry, he's not confident that will happen. The feeling is that the people at the US Department for Homeland Security will take their decision in isolation from the safety people at the US Federation Aviation Administration. That's what happened when the current laptop ban on some flights from the Middle East was brought in. Passengers will no doubt support a ban if they are convinced it'll keep them safer. But the experts are lining up to say that a laptop ban could make flying more dangerous.",
        "Gerard Kevin Hughes, 29, and Gavin Martin Hughes, 31, who are both from Springfield Park in Belfast, appeared in court alongside their older brother Joseph Christopher Hughes, 35, from The Meadows in Downpatrick. The trio all appeared at Belfast Crown Court. The charges arose from incidents in 2013. The court hearing was told that on 9 October, 2013, a car driven by Gavin Hughes was stopped in north Belfast, and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat. The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug. When Gavin Hughes was searched, another amount of cocaine was found in the pockets of his jeans, and he was taken into custody. The following day, officers travelled to an address in the Ligoniel area of the city, which at the time was being rented by Gavin Hughes. When they arrived, police found Gavin's two brothers Gareth and Joseph at the property. Both the property and a vehicle parked outside the house were searched, and further packages of cocaine were seized, alongside items and equipment associated with mixing drugs. Also located during the search were 21 ecstasy tablets. The court heard it was the Crown's case that the rented property was being used to mix the cocaine and prepare it for sale. The total amount of cocaine seized on 9 and 10 October 2013 amounted to 3.25 kilos. The Hughes brothers subsequently pleaded guilty to a number of drugs offences, while Gerard Hughes also admitted two further offences - namely possession of cannabis with intent to supply, and possession of amphetamine on 6 August, 2013. These offences were linked to the seizure of drugs in a car park in east Belfast. Regarding the drugs seizures in October 2013, Gavin Hughes pleaded guilty to five charges, including possessing cocaine with intent to supply. He was handed a four-year sentence and was told he will serve a year in prison, with the remaining three years on licence upon his release. His brother Gerard - who appeared on charges arising from two separate incidents in August and October 2013 - was handed a sentence of five years. Half of this sentence will be spent in jail, with the remaining two years and six months on licence when he is released from prison. Joseph Hughes, who pleaded guilty to a single charge of possessing cocaine with intent to supply, was given a three-year sentence. Six months of this will be spent in jail, with the remaining 30 months on supervised licence upon his release.",

        "Tierra del Fuego judge Lilian Herraez ordered the authorities to seize boats and other assets worth 156m. Argentina claims sovereignty of the islands, which it calls the Malvinas.

Drilling for oil in the territorial waters around the Falklands began in 2010 despite opposition from Buenos Aires. Judge Herraez says the new ruling will take steps to try to seize the companies' assets abroad. The five companies mentioned are: Premier Oil Plc, Rockhopper Exploration Plc, Falkland Oil and Gas Ltd, Noble Energy Inc and Edison International Spa. Three of the companies are British-based, one is American, based in Texas, and one is French-owned, based in Italy. Britain and Argentina went to war over the Falklands in 1982. Argentina occupied the South Atlantic archipelago for 74 days, before British forces regained control. During the conflict, 255 British and about 650 Argentine servicemen were killed, along with three Falklands civilians. Argentina accuses Britain of colonialism, saying the islands lie some 700km (450 miles) off its coast. Britain has held the Falklands for 180 years and says the wishes of its 3,000 residents should be respected. The vast majority of them want the islands to remain a British overseas territory. \"They want to remain British and that view should be respected by everybody, including by Argentina,\" said David Cameron after a 2013 referendum in which the islanders gave almost unanimous support for the status quo. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said at the time that Britain was \"arrogant\" and \"bordering on stupidity\" for refusing to negotiate on the future of the islands.",
        "However the Social Democrat (SPO) Christian Kern said he could not work with any groups that \"incite against people and minorities.\" He was sworn in on Tuesday, replacing Werner Faymann who quit after losing the support of party colleagues. The SPO were trounced in the first round of presidential elections last month by the Freedom Party. The vote was won by the far-right party's candidate Norbert Hofer, who faces a run-off against the Greens' Alexander Van der Bellen for the mostly ceremonial role. It was the first time since World War Two that candidates from Austria's two main parties, the centre-left SPO and the centre-right People's Party, did not make it to the run-off. Mr Hofer has suggested that if elected he could use his power to dismiss the government of the day under certain circumstances. At a news conference, Mr Kern said working with the Freedom Party was possible if certain criteria were met, without specifying what they might be. He added: \"My plan is not to lead the SPO into opposition, the opposite is true. \"But at the end of the day we need an identity and for us it is absolutely unimaginable to work with parties who incite against people and minorities.\" Swearing in Mr Kern at a ceremony in Vienna, outgoing President Heinz Fischer said: \"You are taking on a great and beautiful but also difficult role with a lot of responsibilities.\"",

        "There was plenty of confusion after a dramatic finish, with Greece's Spiros Gianniotis initially given the win before being downgraded to silver. Burnell's disqualification was for two yellow cards - he was unclear why the first was shown, while the second followed a tussle with a rival swimmer. \"Absolutely outrageous,\" said Burnell. The 23-year-old said officials in \"about 600 boats\" had \"no idea what they are doing, giving out cards left, right and centre for nothing.\" He added: \"The whole thing is a joke. I was disqualified two metres from the finish.\" Find out how to get into swimming with our special guide. Burnell was given third and then fifth place at the finish before being disqualified. His first yellow card came while progressing down the straight in second place. \"No-one was either side of me and he pulls out a yellow card,\" said Burnell. \"I couldn't physically have touched anyone and I got a yellow card. \"I shook my head at the guy. This is meant to be the pinnacle of our sport and there are referees who haven't a clue what they are doing.\" Burnell insisted the officials should not get involved unless \"something is clearly wrong.\" \"Imagine this happens in the [football] World Cup final and the referee gives the goalie a yellow card for standing there. That is how ridiculous this is,\" he said. \"They always want to be seen to be doing something. On the Olympic stage, what do they want to do? Do they want to get on telly to show a yellow card? To show their family back home that they're doing something? It's absolutely ridiculous.\" Burnell and the chasing pack had caught sole breakaway swimmer Jarrod Poort, of Australia, before a race to the finish. Gianniotis led the way into the finishing funnel and, even though he might have crossed the finishing board first, Weertman was first to touch it. France's Marc-Antoine Olivier and Zu Lijun of China shared the bronze. Defending champion Oussama Mellouli finished 12th, despite Burnell alleging he impeded his progress. The British swimmer received his second yellow card for pushing the Tunisian off him just metres from the finish. \"He was holding my leg not for one, two, three, but for four or five strokes, so I had to turn round to try to get him off. What am I meant to do?\" he said. \"We're all at top speed and I'm stopped dead. I'm one of the fastest finishers in there. \"He was yellow carded for that, which stopped me winning, but I was disqualified for trying to get him off to try to win the race. Explain that to me.\" Burnell believes appealing against the decision would be futile. \"It's never changed anything in the sport,\" he said. British Swimming did appeal against the decision, but that was dismissed. Organisers have not given British Swimming or any Team GB officials a reason for their decision, but it is thought they did not believe there was any evidence to suggest changing the initial decision was required following a review of the race footage.

        "The supporters claimed the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) would subsidise rent, which it denied. The group made up of trusts from clubs including Arsenal said it was \"disappointed\" by the decision but had expected it. The government said the deal had been \"scrutinised\" and \"upheld.\" The LLDC, which owns the stadium, said West Ham contributed PS15m to the PS272m conversion of the stadium and the development corporation would also pay for \"facilities and services\" such as pitch maintenance and for stewarding on match days, which can cost PS2.5m annually. It is also understood the club will pay up to PS2.5m a year in rent, although the LLDC said it would never reveal that information. In comparison, Manchester City, who moved into the former Commonwealth Games stadium, pay overheads on top of PS4m rent. The coalition of supporters, made up of trusts from clubs including Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, started an online petition which had gained more than 24,000 signatures in favour of a public inquiry. Mat Roper said the group remained concerned they were expected to see it as a \"fabulous deal for the taxpayer\" when they had not seen any figures to support the claim and one document they requested had been \"completely redacted.\" He said: \"We're no nearer the truth of what we think is in the rental agreement....until we know that then we're going to continue. \"Whether it happens to be continuing with that petition, a new petition or.... a new FOI request, it's certainly not dead in the water.\" The group said they remained concerned the deal would give the Hammers a competitive advantage. But the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: \"West Ham United has a concession at the stadium and their contributions reflect that status. \"The contract, awarded after an open public competition, has been widely scrutinised and tested in court. \"The stadium remains in public ownership and the profits from its multiple uses will flow to the taxpayer.\" While West Ham will host all of their home matches at the stadium, British Athletics will take control of the arena for one month every summer.",
        "Her admirers say she played a key role in the economic development of the southern state of Tamil Nadu - but critics say she encouraged a personality cult and fostered corruption in the state. One of India's most successful actresses, her political career was marked by allegations of self-enrichment to fund an extravagant lifestyle. As head of the AIADMK party, she was elected as chief minister of Tamil Nadu on four occasions, overcoming convictions and jail terms to return to office. Jayalalitha was born on 24 February 1948 in what was then the Mysore State. Her father was a lawyer who squandered most of the family fortune and who died when she was only two years old. She excelled at school and, after studying music and dance, began training as an actress. Over the ensuing three decades she became one of India's most popular, and high-profile artists, appearing in more than 140 films. Naturally charismatic, she was introduced to politics by the actor-turned chief minister, MG Ramachandran, with whom she starred in many of her films. Elected to the Tamil Nadu Assembly in 1989 she took over the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Khazagham (AIADMK) party becoming the first ever woman opposition leader. A year later she became chief minister for the first time. She championed the cause of the rural and urban poor by introducing subsidised food canteens, providing free laptops to thousands of school pupils and students and launching other populist schemes like giving away food mixers and grinders to families. Many publicly funded projects in Tamil Nadu were named after her, including a subsidy scheme, under which canteens served food at low prices. They were dubbed Amma Canteens - Amma in Tamil is Mother, an honorific euphemism by which Jayalalitha was often addressed by her followers in the state. These were followed by Amma Bottled Water, Amma Salt, Amma Pharmacies and subsidised Amma Cement. She attracted a level of support that verged on the bizarre. Some followers were known to profess their loyalty through acts such as walking on hot coals or drawing her portrait with their blood and her officials were reported to prostrate themselves at her feet. Incidents of her loyalists setting fire to themselves whenever she faced political setbacks were not unknown. She did much to encourage this cult of personality and huge cut outs of Jayalalitha dominated the Tamil Nadu skyline. Her first term in office came to an abrupt end in 1996 when her party won only four seats in the Legislative Assembly and she lost her own Bargur constituency. The new ruling party wasted little time in investigating allegations of corruption amongst growing concerns about her extravagant lifestyle. During one raid on her premises following a corruption allegation in 1996, police said they had found large quantities of diamond-studded gold jewellery, more than 10,000 saris and 750 pairs of shoes. She was eventually charged with receiving financial incentives in a scheme to buy more than 40,000 colour televisions for local villages and served 30 days in jail. She was barred from standing in the 2001 elections because she had been sentenced to five years imprisonment following allegations she had illegally obtained state-owned property However, her party swept back into power and she was reappointed chief minister despite not having been elected to the state assembly. Although her tenure was swiftly ended, her successor was effectively under her control and in 2003, when her conviction was overturned, she successfully contested a vacant assembly seat and was once more chief minister of Tamil Nadu. But controversy continued to dog her. There were allegations that she used the Tamil Nadu Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) - which had a monopoly on the sale of alcohol in the state - to pay for many of her pet projects. The continuing allegations seemed to do little to dim her charisma or lower her popularity. Following the elections in April 2011, she was sworn in as chief minister for a third term. She was said to nurse ambitions of a greater role in national politics. In the run-up to the 2014 Indian parliamentary elections many of her followers suggested she aspired to become India's prime minister, although she did not confirm this. In 2014 she was sentenced to four years in jail after being convicted of using her position to amass a huge property portfolio as well as a collection of expensive jewellery and luxury cars. It saw her become the first Indian chief minister ever to be removed from office. However, eight months later, in May 2015, the conviction was overturned and within days she was reinstated as chief minister of Tamil Nadu. In the following year's elections she swept back into power, winning her own seat by a handsome margin and retaining the post of chief minister. \"Even when 10 parties allied themselves against me, I did not have a coalition and I placed my faith in God and built an alliance with the people.\" she said. \"It is clear that the people have faith in me and I have total faith in the people.\" Jayalalitha's supporters say she was instrumental in making Tamil Nadu one of India's most economically influential states. But her critics painted her as a deeply corrupt figure who manipulated the system and saw herself as above the law.",
        "Kathleen and Jimmy Cuddihy, who were in their 70s, were found dead just outside Carndonagh on 22 October 2014. Their son, Julian Cuddihy, appeared at Dublin's Central Criminal Court on Tuesday. The court heard he admitted killing his parents but the jury must decide his mental state at the time. Counsel for the prosecution told the jury that forensic psychiatrists for both the prosecution and the defence are in agreement and will give evidence that Mr Cuddihy was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time. The psychiatrists will also say that Mr Cuddihy, who was 42-years-old at the time, believed he was carrying out his parents' wishes and was helping them to secure a place in heaven. The jury heard evidence from a post-mortem examination that the couple had severe head injuries. The court was told that an axe and scissors were found at the scene. Julian Cuddihy was arrested a short time later after it became known he had taken his father's car to a lake area near Clonmany. The court heard that after his arrest, Mr Cuddihy asked gardai (Irish police) if they were telling him his parents were dead. Mr Cuddihy has been receiving treatment at the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum since his arrest. The trial continues.",

A disciplinary panel also fined the 28-year-old PS300 for the grade C offence.

        "That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph). And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days. If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\" Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff. Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday's famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real. To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles. The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes. Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football. For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer. That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks. That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths. Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack. As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space. Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable. More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head. For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up. That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley...who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster. Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort. When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour. As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility. Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\" Robinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be.",

The incident was not seen by the match officials but was caught on video. Schweinsteiger, 31, will miss games against Bournemouth, Norwich and Stoke, and return in time to play Chelsea. Referee Mark Clattenburg spoke to both players after the incident, but did not mention it in his post-match report. A panel of three former elite referees each reviewed the video footage independently of one another and unanimously decided it was a sending-off offence. \"He knows what he's done - he's elbowed me in the face,\" Reid said following the match. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic said it was \"a clear red card - a straight red without any doubts.\" He added: \"It was a moment of madness. He deserved to be sent off, but the referee told me he didn't see it. Fair enough, I believe it.

        "The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said mosques would offer refreshments and \"insight\" into how they run. Leaders from other religions have also been invited, to \"demonstrate unity.\" The MCB has raised concerns about anti-Muslim sentiment since 17 people were killed by Islamist militants in Paris last month. Announcing Visit My Mosque Day, the MCB said: \"Mosques will be sharing tea and refreshments alongside an insight into the day-to-day goings on of a busy Muslim centre of worship. Members of the Muslim community \"may be on hand to answer questions about Muslims and Islam where this is possible,\" it said. \"Local mosques will also be inviting inter-faith leaders as well, and all will be invited to come together to demonstrate unity and solidarity during what has been a tense time for faith communities.\" Speaking outside the East London Mosque in Whitechapel, MCB assistant secretary general Miqdaad Versi said the organisation wanted to \"de-mystify what Islam, Muslims and mosques are all about.\" \"People can have the opportunity to understand these things directly from people that they can speak to, and by actually experiencing these institutions and coming into mosques they can break down the barriers that they previously had,\" he said. Mr Versi said there had been a rise in \"Islamophobia\" since the Paris killings, with attacks on three or four mosques, more verbal attacks against Muslims and \"a lot more hate mail\" being received by the MCB. \"For us it's important to try and create a positive image, and not let the actions of a few impact the reality of the many,\" he added. The Reverend Fred Ashford-Okai, one of those who visited East London Mosque earlier, said: \"The more we know about each other - Muslims, Christians, Jews, even those with no faith - the more we can actually live a more cohesive life in our community.\" More than 20 mosques were expected to take part. The figure is a small proportion of the total number of mosques in Britain, which is estimated to be 1,750. The MCB said only 55-60 of mosques were affiliated to it, and the total includes small establishments such as prayer rooms in schools and offices.",
        "They had known Andrei Karlov well, the ambassador gunned down in Ankara. And they struggled to hold back their emotion. \"This is a big tragedy for all of us - for all Russian people,\" said Larissa Lutkova Turkkan, who works in a Russian cultural association here. \"He was a very good man - and a brilliant diplomat.\" I ask whether she understands the anger of some here towards the Russian government. She pauses. \"I think I understand - but it is really difficult to talk right now.\" Russia and Turkey have been profoundly shaken by the murder of a seasoned diplomat who colleagues describe as softly-spoken and professional. And yet it has not prompted a new crisis in bilateral relations as some feared. Instead, Presidents Erdogan and Putin have used the same language, calling it \"a provocation\" aimed at derailing ties and vowing that it would not succeed. In fact it could, conversely, bring together Russia and Turkey against the common enemy of terror, encouraging greater co-operation between two countries that have always had a tricky relationship. The Russo-Turkish wars spanned four centuries. And a hundred years since their last military clash, their dispute has continued, with Ankara and Moscow taking opposite sides in Syria. Turkey has backed the rebels opposed to President Assad, while Russia's military intervention was key to propping up the Assad regime. A year ago, their feud reached a climax as Turkey shot down a Russian bomber on its border with Syria. President Putin called it \"a stab in the back by an accomplice of terror.\" Moscow said President Erdogan's family was benefiting from oil smuggling by so-called Islamic State. There was the real possibility of a direct military confrontation. For months tempers flared - until President Erdogan wrote a letter of apology to his Russian counterpart, fuelled partly by the need to coax Russian tourists back to Turkish beaches. Syria is the reason behind the warm words now. As Western powers have seen their influence on the Syrian war implode, they've practically vacated the territory to allow Ankara and Moscow, along with others, to fulfil their respective aims there. For Turkey the goal is pushing back IS and Kurdish militias and entrenching Turkish influence in northern Syria. For Russia it's been snatching Aleppo back under regime control and securing Assad along with its own powerful role. Turkish officials publicly deny there was a quid pro quo between Ankara and Moscow but it's widely suspected, not least because Turkey has been silent over Russia's bombardment in Aleppo. And so neither strongman President - Erdogan or Putin - is willing to let the murder of the ambassador get in the way of their Syria rapprochement. But the danger for Mr Erdogan is that some Turks have not followed his warming to Moscow, shown by the assassination of the ambassador, when the gunman shouted \"don't forget Syria, don't forget Aleppo - as long as they aren't safe, you won't taste safety.\" \"Turkey was at the vanguard of opposing the Syrian regime,\" says Sinan Ulgen, a political analyst and chairman of the Edam think tank, \"and it came with high-pitched rhetoric. That made many here acutely aware of the tragedy of Syria. \"But as Turkey is moving away from that aggressive policy on Syria towards a more realistic path and establishing a common understanding with Russia and Iran, it's caused a reaction among that constituency.\" How the murder affects Russian-Turkish relations will in part be determined by the joint investigation that's now under way. If it finds links between the gunman and Syrian opposition groups, it could reawaken the Syria tensions. \"In that case, Russia would expect more from Turkey in terms of cutting support to the Syrian opposition,\" argues Sinan Ulgen. \"There would be an expectation from Russia and Turkish citizens that Turkey should be more disciplined to stop the infiltration by such groups.\" So there's a united, though fragile, front from Ankara and Moscow - for now. The fundamental fact holding these two forces together is that, lacking many other friends in the world at the moment, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan need each other.",
        "So for the one tasked with replacing Karl Robinson as MK Dons manager, changing the mark of a man who had been in charge for more than half of the club's entire existence will be quite a renovation. Robinson, once the third-longest serving boss in England's top four divisions, oversaw the development of England international Dele Alli and led Dons to the Championship for the first time. So, having been engrained in the fundamental DNA of a club only founded in 2004, which prides itself on the football it plays and the development of youngsters, can this carry on under someone else? \"What we are talking about is playing modern football,\" chairman Pete Winkelman said. \"We're a young football club and we want to play football like the big boys play, we might not play it at the same speed or accuracy but I want our supporters to recognise that football. \"The way that we play can be interpreted in many different ways. Karl's interpreted one way, and there's a massive spectrum for other people to interpret it differently. \"You look at the difference between how Chelsea and Tottenham are playing, Bournemouth and Liverpool. They're all playing a similar kind of football but all doing it completely differently.\" This club needs to be a Premier League club one day Robinson was aged just 29 in May 2010 when Winkelman promoted him from Paul Ince's assistant to full-time boss after former England midfielder Ince left Stadium:MK. Failures in successive League One play-off campaigns in his first two seasons in charge showed signs of things to come, and Robinson finally delivered promotion to the Championship in 2015 thanks in no small part to the goals of on-loan Will Grigg and Benik Afobe. But after a dismal Championship season in which they got relegated with only four wins from January onwards, Robinson left on Sunday with the Dons 19th in League One. \"Ironically it's that promotion that changes the whole nature of club and we came back to League One with this burden of expectation that we need to be a Championship club,\" said Winkelman. \"To be honest, this club needs to be a Premier League club one day. I've built a Premier League stadium, Milton Keynes is going to be a top-10 city in the country and we need to have a top-10 ambition. \"It's one thing thinking it, it's another thing delivering it. But where we cannot be is 19th in League One. It's the lowest position we've been in since this stadium. We're going backwards, not forwards.\" It was during that promotion-winning campaign that one of the club's greatest nights to date came - when they defeated Louis van Gaal's Manchester United 4-0 in the League Cup. And Robinson, despite the club finding itself in one of its worst positions since he took over, said his overriding feeling after leaving the club is pride. Why? \"The people of Milton Keynes, the identity, the growth of youth in Milton Keynes and the net profit in transfer fees in six years, the development of young players,\" he told BBC Three Counties Radio. \"The dream was to fill the stadium - (I was the) first person to do that, the first person to beat AFC Wimbledon. \"50 of the squad is home-grown, which is phenomenal in modern-day football I think.\" Instead of dissecting Saturday's 3-0 defeat by Southend United, a solitary Robinson pitched up at a golf course on Monday, trying to take a step back from what had happened. \"I still believed they'd finish in the play-offs. I said that to the chairman on Sunday,\" he continued. \"But I have no arguments with the decisions that were made. I have no problems with anybody.\" Also left working out what has gone wrong are Dons fans, some of whom are unhappy with the recruitment strategy, overseen by the chairman's son Bobby. The club use a recruitment database first set up by Paul Mitchell, who went on to work with Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton and Tottenham, to help make a list of potential signings. But fan questions have arisen after players such as Matthew Upson, Dale Jennings and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas failed to make an impact in the club's Championship season. \"We've made mistakes when we haven't signed to the (recruitment) list: 85 of the players last year weren't on our recruitment list,\" said Pete Winkelman. \"It's something we've put more right this year, but again, not all of them were on the list. \"There are successes and failures in that recruitment list, but the successes hugely outweigh the failures. \"I want to get rid of this thing that we make decisions. I've never picked the team, other than the amount of money people can spend on somebody. I've never had any other influence in the football, and nor has Bob. \"People trying to get at me will get at Bob. It's an easy hit but what I can rely on is one of the strongest databases in football.\" Winkelman now has to sift through \"around 200\" names and is even considering creating a technical director role to work alongside the new manager. Meanwhile, Robinson wants to get back into management as soon as possible and has already been asked whether he would ever want to return to MK Dons. \"It was a very strange question to be asked 24 hours after leaving. But, do you know what, my answer to that was'100',\" he said. \"I would love to manage the club again someday. That's the emotional ties we have with the football club.\"",
        "Experts reassembled pieces of tiles found amid tons of earth from the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. They say the tiles date from the period of the Second Temple, during the time of King Herod about 2,000 years ago. The temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD during a Jewish rebellion. Some 600 segments of coloured stone floor have been found since archaeologists began examining the debris from the hilltop site in 2004. The plateau where the temples stood is the most sacred site in Judaism. It is joined by the Western Wall, venerated by Jews as part of the original supporting wall of the temple compound. Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) is also the place where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, and is the third holiest site in Islam. The archaeologists say the tiles probably came from porticos in the temple's courtyards. Piecing the fragments together \"enables us to get an idea of the Temple's incredible splendour,\" said Dr Gabriel Barkay of the Temple Mount Sifting Project. Experts say they managed to assemble seven potential designs of how the flooring could have looked like. The type of flooring is known as opus sectile, Latin for \"cut work,\" and \"considered to be far more prestigious than mosaic tiles floors,\" according to Frankie Snyder, from the project's team. \"The tile segments were perfectly inlaid such that one could not even insert a sharp blade between them,\" she said. The Temple Mount Sifting Project was established by Israeli archaeologists in 2004 to examine debris dumped by Islamic authorities following expansion work at an underground mosque on the compound. The project attracts thousands of visitors each year who participate in finger-tip searches of the earth and has so far turned up hundreds of ancient relics, including coins, animal bones and pieces of pottery.",
        "The Gills, who finished 20th in League One last season, have signed eight players so far this summer. But having started the season with a 0-0 draw to Doncaster and a 2-0 loss to Reading, Pennock wants more recruits. \"They've got to be the right players, the right characters and more importantly they've got to be good players,\" Pennock, 46, said. \"Everybody is pulling together in the right direction - it's a good changing room and if we can add two or three more I'll be very happy.\" Although the club are still on the lookout for new additions, Pennock is pleased with those who have already arrived. Gillingham have brought in defenders Gabriel Zakuani, Luke O'Neill, Connor Ogilvie and Alex Lacey, strikers Liam Nash, Conor Wilkinson and Tom Eaves and midfielder Billy Bingham. \"Overall, I'm happy with every single one of them - all of the new lads who have come in have contributed to what we've done, they've been absolutely first-class,\" Pennock told BBC Radio Kent. \"I think it's pushed the others on who were here last year as well. The whole club at the moment is in a good place.\"",
        "\"We are about a third of the way down the road,\" she says. Having been one the major players behind Manchester's recent cultural renaissance, she takes on the leadership of the Tate with palpable energy and ambition. Her intention, she says, is to change the Tate in the next 20 years as much as her predecessor - Sir Nicholas Serota - changed it in the last two decades. Given that he oversaw the transformation of the museum from a respected gallery in Pimlico (with a regional outlet in Liverpool) into a global mega art brand, it is a bold claim. Sir Nicholas built his Tate empire with bricks and mortar, refurbishing existing galleries and creating new venues such as Tate Modern. Balshaw will take a different approach with her expansionist agenda, focussing more on people rather than real estate. Roughly speaking, according to statistics collected by the newly-renamed Department of Digital, Culture, Media Sport, around 50 of the British population visit a museum or gallery at least once a year, meaning - of course - 50 do not. These absentees are her target audience. She says: \"We should absolutely reasonably expect 75 of the population to love the fact we have a national collection and feel happy to be visiting Tate... and every young person should be given the opportunity to think and play and experiment in the spaces Tate holds. And that is a big, big shift.\" Her clarity of vision is impressive, but her ability to explain how it will be realised is less exact. She wants to usher in \"an easier language to talk about the joy of art\" but couldn't be specific beyond saying that arcane words should be either avoided or explained. She talks of a radical transformation in audience profile, of a lack of representation of people from BAME background among the staff and in the sector more generally. But when it comes to the organisation she is now leading, which is to be the agent for the change she desires, she says, \"it's not that we need to change anything particularly.\" There is no doubt she is sincere in her ambitions, and probably more capable than most in the museum and gallery world when it comes to broadening the audience. But if she is to be successful in her aims she will need to take a leaf out of Sir Nicholas's job application for the Tate director's job back in the 1980s - in which he wrote that for the institution to change he would need to grasp the nettle.

        "The report focuses on the impact of sea level rises on the Dawlish to Teignmouth line which connects Cornwall and Devon to the rest of the UK. The line was closed for two months in 2014 after it was destroyed by storms. Network Rail said the study would be \"key\" to long-term developments. The report, published in the Journal of Transport Geography, said that 10 of journeys on the line, which was rebuilt and reopened in April 2014, could be affected by 2040. The report said adverse weather disrupted the line about 10 days per year, but according to sea-level predictions that could rise to almost 40 by 2040 and up to 120 by 2100. Academics from Plymouth University, the University of Leeds and the University of York identified a link between sea-level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years. The academics said there could be similar implications for other vulnerable stretches of railway throughout Wales, south-east England, the Cumbrian coast and Scotland. Dr David Dawson, from the University of Leeds, said the long-term future of the line was \"really worrying.\" The report predicts diverting routes could potentially cost billions of pounds. Network Rail said it hoped to develop \"long-term interventions\" to \"secure the future\" of the line. The Department for Transport said it had invested PS31m into improving the resilience of the route and was \"exploring the potential for longer-term improvements in the area.\" In January, the prime minister backed a new Okehampton railway route as the \"most resilient\" alternative to the vulnerable Dawlish line.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device The 30-year-old London 2012 gold medallist recorded 8.18m in his final jump to win ahead of Uruguay's Emiliano Lasa (7.96m). Holly Bradshaw set a new British women's pole vault record of 4.80m. There was a minute's silence before the event for the victims of Monday's attack in the city. Twenty-two people were killed and another 116 were injured by a suicide bomber as the crowd left a performance by US singer Ariana Grande at the Manchester Arena. The Great City Games, which is staged in the city centre, was given the go-ahead by council and police on Tuesday. The Great Manchester Run will also go ahead this Sunday and will be covered on BBC One from 12:30-14:30 BST. Friday's competition was the first major event in Manchester since the attack and drew thousands to a sunny Deansgate and Albert Square. The latter, which three days ago hosted a vigil for those who lost their lives in the attack, was the scene for a stellar display from Rutherford. His jump of 8.08m in his second attempt had already ensured victory before his final effort, which saw him extend his lead further. \"It's been absolutely amazing to get you all out here in support of us,\" said Rutherford afterwards. \"It's been an incredibly difficult week for everybody and I'm so pleased we can come here and give you something to smile about and enjoy. \"Manchester is one of my favourite cities in the world to go to. I love it for the football and I love it for all you guys getting behind us in sport. \"It truly is a special place.\" Media playback is not supported on this device It was a superb evening for Bradshaw, who beat her own personal best before going on to surpass her own British record in the pole vault. Starting at 4.50m, the 25-year-old from Preston cleared at the third attempt to ensure victory over her rivals, with fellow Britons Rachel Gibbons and Sally Peake and Belgium's Chloe Henry all failing to go higher than 4m. She then went on to surpass the mark of 4.71m she set in 2012 before also clearing 4.80m at the first attempt. \"It was a bit nerve-wracking at the start,\" Bradshaw, who was sixth at London 2012 and fifth four years later in Rio, told BBC Sport. \"But there were great conditions. Once I got in the zone, to jump 4.72 and then 4.80 I am really chuffed. \"Training has been going great. I am in the best shape I have ever been in. I just need to stay healthy, keep sharp and build momentum going into the majors.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Jonnie Peacock eased to victory in the T44 men's 100m in 10.92 seconds, accelerating to pull well ahead of his three challengers. South Africa's Arnu Fourie was second (11.25secs), with Michail Seitis third (11.39) and Italy's Emanuele di Marino fourth (12.18). \"We had a massive shift on technical aspects last year and had just six months to get them right before the Olympics but we improved a lot,\" Peacock told BBC Sport. \"I still have a lot to improve. My first five metres today were terrible.\" Sophie Kamlish made it a British double in the event with victory in the T44 women's 100m, beating Dutch three-time Paralympic gold medallist Marlou van Rhijn by 0.02secs in a time of 13.24. On the specially laid track on Deansgate, Asha Philip pipped Australian Sally Pearson to the win the women's 100m in a time of 11.48secs. Pearson made up for that disappointment by winning the final race of the evening - the 100m hurdles - in 12.81secs. Another Briton, James Dasaolu, clocked 10.25 to take the men's 100m after 41-year-old Kim Collins, who claimed gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, pulled up with cramp. American Johnny Dutch, who was coaxed out of retirement last year, impressed in the men's 200m hurdles with a time of 22.48secs, comfortably beating a British trio led by Sebastian Rodger (22.89). There was a surprise result in the men's 150m as Greece's Lykourgos-Stefanos Tsakonas claimed a personal best of 15.04secs to see off the challenge of Britain's Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, who also ran a PB of 15.22.

        "Corporal William Savage, 30, from Penicuik, Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, both from Edinburgh, died in the blast. They were killed on Route 611 in the Nahr-e-Saraj district on 30 April 2013. The soldiers, who were in an armoured Mastiff vehicle, were unlawfully killed on active service, the coroner ruled. Coroner, Darren Salter, will now write to Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. The inquest was held at Oxfordshire Coroners Court. Earlier, it heard that an improvised explosive device (IED) had been put in place using a tunnel and was triggered using a command wire from behind the 10ft wall of a nearby compound. Post-mortem examinations concluded the three, who were with B Company, 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, would have been deeply unconscious virtually instantly and unaware of what had happened. Mr Salter said the Mastiff was designed to resist improvised explosive device (IED) attacks. There had been earlier damage to this one, the second of three evolutions of the vehicle, in a strike in 2009. However, there was \"no significant evidence\" that the vehicle failed to provide the \"expected level of protection,\" Mr Salter ruled. He also noted that experts referred to the size of the explosion as a \"blast overmatch\" and that the men were seated in the rear of the vehicle, which was nearest to the explosion. The men died when an improvised explosive device (IED) tore through their heavily armoured Mastiff vehicle on April 30 last year. The Royal Military Police made inquiries to the Afghan National Police about the incident, but no-one was arrested over it. The Mastiff, a protective patrol vehicle, had gone from Forward Operating Base Ouellette to another base at Lashkar Gah Durai and was on its way back again when the attack happened. There were four vehicles in the patrol. The driver of the Mastiff, Fusilier Paul Howell, said in a statement that the regular locks to the rear doors had been faulty, and he had reported them twice. He told the inquest that on the day in question, though they were stiff, they were fully sealed when closed. Extra battle locks were not deployed, but they were not supposed to be when the vehicle was in open desert, only when there were potential public order situations, he said. He said in his statement that there were 20 ammunition tins under the seats in the rear, which was normal. The inquest heard that the IED was buried under the road, had been placed there by tunnelling, and was triggered by a command wire, probably from behind the 10ft wall of a nearby compound. Sgt David Boxwell, who was in command of the patrol, said he had not been told of any problems relating to the place where the blast took place. As for tunnelling under the road, he earlier said: \"I had never heard of it before.\" Company Sgt Major Steven Main said: \"Everything we had had was off the tarmac road. IEDs were placed in the dust - it's easier to conceal.\" He said there was no sign on the ground of the IED. \"The wire was so deep that we would not have seen it.\"",
        "David Davis rebuffed Nicola Sturgeon's calls for Holyrood to be given powers over areas such as immigration as part of any deal with Brussels. The Conservative politician was in Scotland a day after the Scottish government published its draft independence referendum bill. He met his Scottish government counterpart Michael Russell for talks. When asked if the First Minister is being \"realistic\" with her demands, he said: \"They are both reserved powers. Immigration and international affairs are both reserved powers.\" Before the EU referendum in June, leading Brexit campaigner and then justice secretary Michael Gove had suggested Scotland could get powers over immigration as part of a deal to leave the EU. But Mr Davis said: \"It's hard to see how a separate immigration policy would work.\" He insisted the Brexit arrangements would be a \"United Kingdom deal,\" rejecting the idea put forward by the Scottish Government that the country should be able to keep its place in the European single market. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said a referendum will be called if it is felt necessary to \"protect Scotland's interests\" in the wake of the Brexit vote. But she has insisted her government was \"exploring all of the options\" for safeguarding Scotland's place in Europe, and has said she will publish proposals in the coming weeks for keeping Scotland in the European single market even if the UK leaves. After his first meeting with Mr Davis, Mr Russell said he expected to soon be able to announce a formal process for Scottish input into the Brexit process. Speaking at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Mr Davis said while it has \"got to be a United Kingdom deal,\" it would \"incorporate protection for the people of Scotland.\" He also said the eventual agreement would \"reflect the interests of the people of Scotland.\" Mr Davis stated: \"The aim is to get the maximum possible barrier-free access to the European Union market, as well as being able to get other markets globally. \"How we achieve that? We're not at that stage yet, but that's the aim.\" He continued: \"I don't think the Scottish people want another referendum, but that's for them. \"I have simply got the single aim in front of me, which is to get the best deal possible, and that includes the best deal for the Scottish people.\" Yesterday the Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, said that he thinks the United Kingdom might actually rein back on Brexit. Mr Davis told BBC Scotland that is not the case: \"That's not going to happen. The prime minister has made clear that the now infamous phrase'Brexit means Brexit' is going to happen. \"The people have given us an instruction, we have to carry it out.\"",

        "Foyle and Lagan Search and Recue are among 67 charities to benefit from the Department of Transport scheme. The grants were awarded from a funding pot of PS5m being delivered across the UK over a five year period. Phillip Batt, a founding member of Lagan Search and Rescue, said the money was vital to the group's survival. The Belfast based organisation is to receive a total of PS31,590. \"It's a tremendous boost to organisation, this is our sixth year in operation and we now have three lifeboats and 40 plus volunteers,\" said Mr Batt. \"We'll be using this vital money mainly for volunteer equipment, such as new life jackets and helmets. \"This highlights the commitment of volunteers, we launch our lifeboat between four and seven minutes and that really is on a par with the RNLI.\" The organisation not only deal with local emergencies, they can also be called in to help national search efforts here and further afield. Some volunteers recently returned from the Aegean Sea where they were involved in rescuing migrants and refugees in trouble at sea. Their counterparts in Londonderry, Foyle Search and Rescue, have been handed PS42,000 - the highest of any of the charities across the UK. The group have been operating in the Foyle area since 1993 and the bulk of their work involves call-outs for missing or vulnerable persons. UK Maritime Minister John Hayes said: \"Every day countless volunteers in water rescue charities across our island nation carry out vital work during emergencies, not only around our coasts but also keeping our rivers, lakes and inshore waters safe. \"It is imperative that we value and support their tireless efforts. I am delighted to be able to announce the latest round of funding, ensuring they have the equipment and resources they need to provide their round-the-clock lifesaving services,\" he added.",

        "The former police captain ran a covert counter-insurgency unit that detained and killed anti-apartheid activists. It operated in secrecy from Vlakplaas, a farm near Pretoria, recruiting black liberation movement members whom it turned into killers. He revealed the existence of Vlakplaas in 1989 when he was smuggled out of South Africa to write his story. Coetzee claimed responsibility for the killings of several African National Congress (ANC) members. He took refuge in London after exposing the group in an interview with a liberal Afrikaans newspaper. Once he was in exile, he joined the ANC, where he was known as Comrade Dirk with allegiance to Nelson Mandela, and himself became an assassination target for the white-minority government. He later returned to South Africa and joined the post-apartheid spy service after Mr Mandela became president in 1994. He was later convicted of murder, but granted amnesty by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997 when he publicly confessed to murdering a Durban human rights lawyer, Griffiths Mxenge. However, Coetzee failed to reveal the place where another activist, Sizwe Kondile, had been buried after being killed and burnt. Coetzee was central to many secrets of the apartheid era, but in giving him amnesty for his crimes, the Truth Commission found that he had simply been following orders from higher-ranking security police commanders. He died at Life Wilgers Hospital in Pretoria from kidney failure, a hospital spokeswoman said on Thursday.",

Alexander, of Griffithstown, Torfaen, admitted fraud and was jailed for two years in January. But at Cardiff Crown Court on Thursday, a judge ordered him to pay back PS115,000 to his ex-employers. \"It seems you were doing it as some kind of philanthropic act,\" Judge Stephen Hopkins QC said. \"In some cases spending PS5,000 on items and then selling the items to employees for as little as PS180 on the philanthropic basis they will not have been able to buy the items themselves.\" He ordered Alexander to pay his ex-employers PS115,867 within six months or face an additional 18 months in jail. \"You had an enormous impact on a large number of perfectly innocent people,\" the judge added. \"Those to whom you sold goods to now feel stupid and stressed. \"The impact upon your colleagues has been awful. You have stolen from the company and there was a dip in morale for a period. \"This was a gross and serious breach of trust over a substantial period of years.\" Alexander had control of spending at car parts company, Northern Automotive Systems in Gilwern, near Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. He made 287 purchases on internet sites such as Amazon, eBay and Argos. The court heard the company's usual monthly credit card bill was in the hundreds, but when Alexander became purchasing manager the bill \"increased to nearly PS10,000 per month.\" But his scheme was discovered when suspicious company managers asked employees if they had bought cut-priced electrical goods. The conman deleted emails as well as falsifying invoices, receipts and card statements to cover his trail. Alexander, who had worked at the company for 14 years, bought petrol for his white Land Rover, red Mini and his partner's Ford Fiesta.",
        "The Oil and Gas Technology Centre will partly fund the work while also acting as a bridge between small tech firms and the big oil producers. The industry said research projects have recently been neglected. It said this happened after many production platforms were sold by the big oil majors to much smaller firms. Oil supply company Mistras has been developing technology more commonly used to enable expectant mothers to see their babies. The ultrasound scanners, complete with cold jelly, are being used to detect corrosion in pipes. The Dyce-based company hopes the technology centre will help them get their product to new customers. Managing director Tim Walsh said: \"What we are hoping and expecting from the technology centre is that it will allow us as an organisation that has solutions to particular problems that we know exist to get a better connection with end users and clients and get more traction. \"We want them to allow us to take them out into the field, give us the opportunity to demonstrate to potential clients that the technology works and that the technology can actually allow them to do what we want them to do.\" The Oil and Gas Technology centre will invest in small firms with solid ideas and help pair some of those developers with the offshore operators that need them. Chief executive Colette Cohen said: \"We have much more operators in the north sea now, I think it's about 60 operators whereas back in the 80s it was about five or six, so it is a hugely different world. \"Those smaller operators don't have a technology organisation. They're not big enough and they can't support that, it wouldn't be economic. \"So this is a time when we can provide that service to them.\" The new centre will build on the existing work being carried out by Aberdeen's two universities. At Robert Gordon University they have a drilling-rig simulator where they train students and refresh the skills of those in the industry. They will now be able to incorporate new technologies into their models to see if they work effectively. Prof Phil Hassard said: \"They'll be able to get the results back from that.... they can be tested here and are more cost effective than trying to do it on a real rig.\" The centre's conception stems from the principles of Sir Ian Wood's report into maximising economic recovery in the North Sea. The oil tycoon was one of the invited guests at the official opening.",
        "Devon and Cornwall Police has announced a 73 drop in mental health patients detained in cells since January 2015. Dr Anne Hicks, who runs the AE department at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, said they had seen a sharp rise in evening and weekend cases. She warned the police policy was causing \"tension\" between the services. In January 2015, Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer wrote in confidence to NHS bosses and told them police would take mentally ill people to hospital and other places of safety, rather than keep them in custody. It said that police would be encouraged to call an ambulance if they detained a mentally ill adult, and should take a child to an AE Department. Dr Hicks, mental health lead for the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said \"agitated mental health patients\" were brought into the hospital by officers, which \"created real tension between us and the police.\" She said the police policy had coincided with an overall rise in mental health admissions after normal working hours finished at 17:00 BST, which she estimated to be around 20. \"We don't feel we can deliver that safe nurturing space those patients need,\" she added. Suzy Franklin, branch secretary of Unison at the hospital, said the rise added pressure to AE, which \"has a knock-on effect for waiting times.\" In his letter Chief Constable Sawyer said health services should be providing care for mentally ill people. It said: \"Nearly every week my force is experiencing detentions where mentally ill people are in our custody centres for a number of unacceptable hours and even days. This cannot be allowed to continue.\" The letter said the force would take mentally ill people to hospital and other places of safety rather than keep them in custody. Ordinarily those people who police believe to be a threat to themselves or others due to mental illness would be sent to a secure part of a mental hospital. Since the letter, there have been 192 detentions under the Mental Health Act - a drop of 73 compared to the previous 12 months. Mr Sawyer said mental health calls put \"an awful lot of time and pressure\" on officers as they know \"they're not the best person to deal with them.\" He said the \"intention was not to pass\" them on to hospitals, but if they are not at risk to themselves or others, then \"AE is the next best place to consider before a police cell.\" The government has pledged PS247m to improve mental health services in AE.",

        "Researchers looked at three areas of England, 20 years apart, and found new rates of dementia were lower than past trends would suggest. They say improvements in men's health is the most likely explanation. But charities warn against complacency, with more than 200,000 dementia cases diagnosed each year in the UK. Researchers, funded by the Medical Research Council and dementia charities, interviewed about 7,500 people aged 65 and over living in Cambridgeshire, Nottingham and Newcastle in the early 1990s. The whole process, which included detailed questionnaires about cognition and lifestyle, was repeated in the same way two decades later. They found rates of new cases of dementia had been fairly steady in women over this time, but had fallen in men. Extrapolating their findings to apply to the rest of the UK, they say there would be 40,000 fewer cases of the disease than estimates put forward two decades ago would suggest. Scientists admit they are unsure exactly what lies behind this trend but say it could be that men have become better at looking after themselves. For example, better heart and brain health - with fewer men smoking, less salt used in food, and a greater emphasis on exercise and blood pressure medication may have helped, they say. They acknowledge it is hard to decipher why the same trends are not apparent in women, but speculate men may be catching up on health gains that women already experience. Despite this, they warn that other factors - such as rising levels of obesity and diabetes - may reverse this trend in years to come. Prof Carol Brayne, at the University of Cambridge, and part of the research team, said: \"I'm pretty optimistic that it's stabilising, but if we don't further improve health, then we would expect the numbers to go up with further ageing of the population, so it's a sort of cautious optimism.\" Scientists say the most important finding is that a rise in dementia is not inevitable and can be fought. And they call for a better balance of funds so more money is put into prevention in mid-life. Meanwhile, Dr James Pickett, head of research at the charity Alzheimer's Society, said the research was encouraging. But he added: \"People are living for longer, and with other risk factors such as diabetes and obesity on the rise, there will still be over 200,000 new cases of dementia each year. \"That's still an enormous number of people who require better information and health and social care support.\" Other experts point out the way dementia is diagnosed has changed over time and initiatives focusing on spotting the signs of dementia earlier may offset any reductions seen.",
        "The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond's visit to Tripoli is intended to provide visible international backing for the fledgling Government of National Accord. He also arrived with further practical assistance; PS10m-worth of aid, in part intended to combat people smuggling and terrorism. Guide to key Libyan militias Here then is the fundamental driver for Britain's renewed engagement with Libya (and indeed for that of other key European Union partners like France and Italy). Libya's problems of instability are creating new ungoverned spaces in which so-called Islamic State (IS) is taking root. The refugee crisis and trafficking of people is compounding the European Union's wider problems as refugees sometimes literally wash up on its shores. The real question though is why now? Why has a British foreign secretary returned to Tripoli - the first visit since 2011? And secondly what exactly are the parameters of this relationship, how far will British (and European) support go and to what extent will it have an explicitly military dimension? The timing is the easiest to answer. The chaos in Libya has spawned two competing governments and a plethora of armed militias. But the new UN-backed Government of National Accord, which recently set up shop in Tripoli under Fayez Sarraj, is seen as the best, albeit slim, chance of establishing some order in the country. However, given its origins in the UN process, outside assistance carries a risk - a danger that the new government will not be seen as an outgrowth of Libyan aspirations but as something emanating from outside. Despite the risks, the new government needs lots of help to put down roots in unpromising terrain. Britain has been giving aid - and is going to be giving more aid. Funds will go to tackling illegal migration, smuggling and organised crime as well as counter-terrorism. But what about practical assistance? There are persistent reports that British special forces are on the ground in Libya to counter IS. Indeed their French counterparts have been far less successful in evading the media spotlight. Their presence was spectacularly \"outed\" by the French newspaper Le Monde back in February. Special Forces are one thing but regular combat troops quite another. For some time there has been discussion about deploying a 6,000-strong European force to Libya under Italian command. This would secure the airport in Tripoli and use this as a base to train up the Libyan military. This proposed mission has drawn strong criticism from the Chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Crispin Blunt, who has warned that such troops could simply become targets for local militias and IS. The British Government has been less than explicit in responding to Mr Blunt, largely taking refuge in assertions that no decisions have been taken and that no request has yet come from the new Libyan government itself. Some kind of training may be needed and Britain is likely to play a role. An earlier effort that brought Libyan personnel to Britain ended in controversy when some of the Libyan students were found guilty of rape and other sex attacks. Indeed their behaviour terrorised the neighbourhood and led to their prompt return to Libya. But some kind of training assistance will be required, for the police, coastguard, and Libya's military. The EU is likely to coordinate a significant proportion of this and it's not clear yet how much of this will take place inside Libya or in a neighbouring country - Tunisia for instance. There could also be pressure on the Libyan government to allow international naval forces to enter Libyan territorial waters to help combat people smuggling. This could give Britain an expanded naval role. Much will depend upon exactly what the Government of National Accord thinks it needs. Libya's instability is now though a key threat to southern Europe and beyond. Thus if the new government can consolidate its position it will be very difficult for the key European military players - like Britain - to refuse assistance.",

In other shocks South Africa, Mali and Algeria were also eliminated. DR Congo boasted an outstanding record in the previous four tournaments for home-based footballers with two titles and two quarter-finals finishes. They were expected to beat Congo Brazzaville in front of their home fans in Kinshasa and qualify for the 2018 Championship in Kenya next January and February. Jean-Marc Makusu Mundele put the title-holders ahead on 36 minutes only for Jaures Ngombe to equalise just two minutes later. DR Congo needed at least one more goal to survive, but Congo defended bravely to clinch only a second appearance at the 16-team tournament. Severely depleted South Africa contained Zambia for 79 minutes in Ndola before conceding two goals in three minutes to lose the match 2-0 and the tie 4-2 on aggregate. Justin Shonga bagged a brace for Zambia against a South Africa side deprived of many first choice players because clubs refused to release them. Mali, who lost the 2016 final against DR Congo in Kigali, were another shock casualty as they had a man sent off when losing 1-0 at home to Mauritania. Karamoko Traore scored on 38 minutes in Bamako and the hosts were reduced to 10 men before half-time when Boubacar Samassekou was shown the red card with Mauritania advancing 3-2 on aggregate. Nigeria secured a ticket to Kenya by overcoming Benin 2-0 in Kano. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, the Nigerians secured their place through goals from Rabiu Ali and Kingsley Eduwo. Ivory Coast, third behind DR Congo and Mali at the 2016 Nations Championship, scored seven minutes into stoppage time to pip Niger for a place at next year's finals. Sanfo Sylla scored the crucial goal to give the Ivorians a 1-0 victory and an away goals victory after the tie ended 2-2. Angola missed a penalty in Luanda before Dany scored the only goal of the tie just past the hour to inflict a first loss in 11 matches on Madagascar. Rwanda staged a brave comeback to defeat Uganda 2-0 in Kigali but failed 3-2 on aggregate, with Cameroon and Sudan also booking places in Kenya. On Friday, Morocco and Libya knocked out Egypt and Algeria respectively as they booked their places at Kenya 2018. Morocco beat Egypt 3-1 in Rabat on Friday to win the tie 4-2 overall. Libya held Algeria to a 1-1 draw in Sfax to go through to the finals with a 3-2 aggregate victory.

        "The Times Educational Supplement (TES) says measures to guard against grade inflation were not appropriate for this year's English exams. Teaching unions have accused Ofqual of \"regulatory failure\" and say it is more evidence of flawed exam marking. But the regulator insists it applied its measures correctly. It comes as state and private school heads call for an independent inquiry into the problems. Last week Ofqual said it felt the way this year's English GCSE exams were graded was fair, despite the grade boundaries being moved significantly part-way through the year. Teachers have complained that pupils achieving exactly the same marks would have received different grades depending on what time of year they sat the exam. And many who were predicted a grade C, obtained a grade D in their summer exams. Ofqual found that June's grade boundaries were correct, while January's were \"too lenient.\" A key document sent to exam boards, which is on the Ofqual website, sets out how it expects exam boards to use a process known as \"comparable outcomes\" to ensure that grade standards are maintained between GCSEs year-on-year. It sets out five conditions for when such processes should be used to alter the way papers are marked. According to the TES report, this year's English GCSE and the circumstances around it failed to meet four of the conditions. The first of Ofqual's five conditions was that the cohort - or pupils from that year- in a subject \"must be similar, in terms of ability, to those of previous years.\" But last week's report on English GCSEs noted that the \"attainment profile\" for 2012 dropped, as grammar and independent school pupils were replaced with extra, lower-achieving comprehensive pupils. The second condition was that the qualification must be \"fit for purpose.\" On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament that this year's English GCSE was \"not fit for purpose.\" The third condition was that the \"nature of the qualification\" must be the same. Ofqual's report last week stated that \"these qualifications are different from previous English qualifications in a number of ways.\" Finally, the regulator said in the letter that comparable outcomes must only be applied where \"previous grades were appropriate.\" Ofqual's report said that the English GCSE grades in January were \"too generous.\" The only condition that appears to have been met is that teaching standards have remained largely consistent. The guidelines also state: \"Students should not be advantaged or disadvantaged simply because they were the first to sit a new set of examinations.\" The watchdog has interpreted its own conditions differently, and is insisting that the comparable outcomes approach that prevented grades from rising in June was correctly implemented. But Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT heads' union, said: \"Ofqual doesn't seem to have applied the concept of comparable outcomes properly. \"In this instance there is a regulatory failure. It is a big mess.\" And Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said this appeared to be \"another piece of evidence that procedures applied to this exam was not fit for purpose.\" Meanwhile, Ofqual said: \"The comparable outcomes approach was used correctly for GCSE English this year and we stand by this decision. \"Comparable outcomes are not intended to produce identical results year on year. \"What's important is that outcomes can be compared when taking into consideration a range of factors which may affect the results. More details on the use of this approach can be found in our report.\" But Dr Christopher Ray, chairman of the Head Masters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), said the issue was evidence of a deeper problem with Ofqual. \"The verdict of Ofqual's initial report and the reasoning to support it fall well short of answering the questions raised in the minds of schools and pupils.\" Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: \"It is clear that pupils, parents and education professionals, across the spectrum of schools, feel that pupils have been done a disservice. \"Whilst the Education Secretary Michael Gove says he is'saddened' by the injustice that has been served to thousands of pupils, he is showing how out-of-touch he is with pupil opinion by refusing to take action. Labour supports calls for an independent inquiry to get to the bottom of this mess.\" The Commons Education Committee is set to start an inquiry into the GCSE grading problems next week.",

        "The robot sucked the air into its big Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument to reveal the concentration of different gases. The Sam analysis is ongoing but no major surprises are expected at this stage - carbon dioxide will dominate. CO2 is the chief component of the Martian air, as found by the Viking probes in the 1970s and the Phoenix lander in 2008. Of keener interest will be whether a signal for methane has been detected by Curiosity. The gas has recently been observed by satellite and by Earth telescopes, and its presence on the Red Planet is intriguing. Methane should be short-lived and its persistence suggests a replenishing source of some kind - either biological or geochemical. It is hoped Sam can shed light on the issue. The results from this first test could be announced next week, said Curiosity deputy principal scientist Joy Crisp, but she cautioned that it would be some time before definitive statements could be made about the status of methane on Mars. \"When Sam is at its best it can measure various parts per trillion of methane, and the expected amounts based on measurements taken from orbit around Mars and from Earth telescopes should be in the 10 to a few 10s of parts per billion,\" she told reporters. \"But it's so early in the use of Sam, which is a complicated instrument, and we have to sort through the data.\" Curiosity - also known as the Mars Science Laboratory, MSL - has now driven more than 100m from the location on the floor of Gale Crater where it landed a month ago. A new picture from the overflying Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft shows its progress. \"You can see the rover with the white deck on top and the black wheels, and you can see our tracks behind us,\" explained mission manager Mike Watkins. \"We're about a football field or so away from the touch-down point - from Bradbury Landing.\" Curiosity is heading to a point dubbed Glenelg by scientists. This is about 300m further to the east from its current position. Satellite pictures point to Glenelg being an intersection of three distinct types of rock terrain. Researchers think it will be a good place to start to characterise the geology of Gale Crater. The rover's arrival at the junction is still some weeks away, however. Engineers have parked the vehicle for a few days to practise using the 2m-long robotic arm. This carries a 30kg tool turret on its end and the mission team needs to learn how to move the device in the weaker gravity conditions that exist on Mars. \"Mars has about 38 of Earth gravity,\" said Matt Robinson, the lead engineer on Curiosity's arm. \"Under Earth gravity, the arm sags to a certain position. On Mars, if you were to command the arm to the exact same joint angles, the turret would be at a higher position than it was on Earth. \"To compensate, we have flight software that does the mathematics to position the arm lower to recreate the exact same pose of the turret with respect to the hardware on the rover. \"So a big part of this exercise is to verify that flight software is doing that compensation properly,\" he told BBC News. Once the arm check-out is done, Curiosity will pick up the pace to get to Glenelg. En route, the rover will watch for an early opportunity to test its turret instruments on a rock. This will involve putting the \"hand lens\" known as Mahli (Mars Hand Lens Imager) close to the test object. Mahli is essentially a close-up camera that can resolve rock minerals down to the size of a grain of talcum powder. The other turret instrument engineers want to see in action is APXS, an X-ray spectrometer that can determine the abundance of chemical elements in rocks. Also in line to make its debut soon is the turret's scoop mechanism (Collection and Handling for Interior Martian Rock Analysis, or Chimra). The robot arm will pick up a sample of soil and deliver it to the labs inside the rover body for analysis. and follow me on Twitter",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device First-half tries from Vincent Clerc and Maxime Medard opened a lead of 16 unanswered points as England shipped penalties and made basic errors across the park. England struck back with a fine try from Ben Foden and closed to within seven points with three minutes left when Mark Cueto capitalised on a break from replacement Matt Banahan. But they ran out of time and inspiration as Les Bleus set up a deserved semi-final clash with Wales. France, so poor in their pool matches, were a side transformed as they took revenge for their World Cup defeats of 2007 and 2003. \"England were blown away in the first half and probably got a proper telling off. They came out with a little more pace and precision but they made too many mistakes with knock-ons, penalites and turnovers. England were never going to score from 80m out. \"Those who have watched England before could see they were not any different but whereas Scotland and Argentina couldn't last the distance and England won late on, France were a different outfit.\" The defeat will leave manager Martin Johnson under pressure after his gamble of pairing Jonny Wilkinson and Toby Flood at 10 and 12 failed to ignite the England back line, while his forwards were repeatedly second best at the set-piece and in the loose. Johnson's contract expires in November, and four weeks as memorable for scandals off the pitch as any achievements on it will do little to appease the notoriously twitchy committee-men at the Rugby Football Union. France were supposedly a team in pieces, beaten by Tonga just a week ago and with coach Marc Lievremont publicly berating his players, but so clear-cut was their victory that much of the atmosphere had been sucked from the contest long before the end. England had an early opportunity with a line-out deep in French territory after a clever grubber from Foden only for Lionel Nallet to burgle back possession, and they then tore into France again as Alexis Palisson was smashed backwards after taking a garryowen and Manu Tuilagi thundered into Morgan Parra. After spluttering sporadically for four games, England's Kiwi campaign ended as it probably deserved to: in defeat, to a team that was more dynamic, more clinical and far more composed when it mattered most. Read more from Tom's blog But it was the most fleeting of false dawns. Dmitri Yachvilli slotted a penalty from distance after Flood failed to release his man on the deck, and France took a grip they would never relinquish. Wilkinson was struggling, sending the re-start straight into touch and flinging a pass the same way, and France then went close to the first try of the contest as Clerc took a long pass out on the left and was just bundled into touch by the corner flag. Yachvilli made it 6-0 with a second sweet strike from 45 metres after Matt Stevens was penalised for collapsing a scrum, and then slid another penalty just wide from the same spot. England's players had talked of \"blitzing\" France in the first 20 minutes, but it was Lievremont's men with all the menace and danger. Another line-out was stolen, and when the ball was sent left Clerc stepped and spun through limp challenges from Wilkinson, Chris Ashton and Foden to dive over and make it 11-0. England were once again static in their few attacks, only Tuilagi's bullocking runs offering any threat, Flood reduced to aiming a long-range drop-goal pit which missed by a street. Louis Deacon shipped another sloppy penalty, allowing Yachvili to kick to the corner, and after thunderous drives from the forwards left wing Alexis Palisson and Medard combined out wide to put the full-back in for France's second try. England were in disarray, only Yachvili's failures with the conversions keeping them in the game, and when they finally created space for their wingers Cueto was dragged down metres from the line before another wayward pass from Wilkinson shut the door on Ashton wide out right. England had never before come back to win from a margin of more than 12 points, and the errors continued to come thick and fast as Tom Croft became the latest to cough up the ball. They grabbed an unlikely lifeline when Ben Youngs took a quick tap and go to release Foden, who jinked and dummied his way over to make it 16-5 with 23 minutes left on the clock, Wilkinson popping over the conversion for 16-7. Johnson threw on his replacements but England kept wasting what good field possession they could work. Flood popped out a careless off-load deep in the French 22 to allow a clearing kick to snuff out the danger, and when Nick Easter tried to rumble from deep within his own 22 his hospital pass to Tuilagi triggered another knock-on. France, led by man-of-the-match Imanol Harinordoquy, set up camp in front of the English posts, and when the ball was fed back to Trinh-Duc the replacement fly-half slotted the drop-goal to make it 19-7. Banahan's late charge allowed Cueto to touch down for a try at the death, but with Flood's conversion sliding wide England needed a converted try to force extra time - something they could neither conjure nor say their performance deserved.

She has been trialling a new drug called Vimizim, which has now won Welsh Government approval. It will cost about PS880,000 a year to treat eligible patients in Wales. \"We were just fingers crossed waiting around for a long time, it's been constant waiting, hoping things are going to happen,\" said Gracie's mother, Yvette. \"It's just a huge weight off our shoulders. We just feel so happy that the result has been a positive one.\" The drug was approved for use in England in December last year, but a decision had to be made on whether it would be available on the Welsh NHS. \"Yes, it is an expensive drug, but what you have to think there is it is an ultra-rare disease being treated by a drug that can't just be pushed out like paracetemol,\" argued Gracie's mother. \"It's going to take a lot more research to develop the drug, which is the enzyme that Gracie is missing, that is putting it back into the body. \"I think it is wrong to say somebody like Gracie doesn't deserve that because it is expensive. She has a lot to give to life and a lot to give to society.\" Gracie, who lives in Mynydd Isa near Buckley, has been receiving weekly therapy with the drug at Wrexham Maelor Hospital. It has led to a great improvement in her condition, with better lung function, improved eyesight and she does not need to use a wheelchair to get about. The campaign to get the drug approved for Gracie received a huge boost when the schoolgirl was captured on camera singing a song to thank hospital staff. Announcing the decision to fund the new drug, the Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he had listened to the advice of the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group. It said the medicine was both a clinically and a cost effective way to treat the disease. \"Up until now we've only had therapies that are things that help people to manage with the condition,\" explained Mr Drakeford. \"This new drug Vimizim actually makes a difference to the condition itself. It will really make a difference.\"",

        "Giving people the right to buy their council houses and shares in previously nationalised firms such as British Telecom and British Gas were among the initiatives that won her much support. But some believe that other changes, such as those that made mortgages and credit much easier to get, sowed the seeds of future crises that still affect many to this day. Here, BBC reporters look at some of the changes that, for better or worse, have changed our finances forever. By Brian Milligan, personal finance reporter, BBC News. The Right to Buy Scheme for council houses was one of Margaret Thatcher's most popular policies. It was enshrined in the Housing Act of 1980, making it one of her first major pieces of legislation after she came to office in 1979. The number of people who bought their council house from their local authorities rose to 200,000 by 1982, and again peaked at 180,000 in 1989, her last full year as prime minister. Since the Housing Act came into force, it is estimated that some two million homes have been sold to former council tenants. The sale price was based on market valuation, but included substantial discounts, depending on how long a tenant had been living there. When Labour came to power in 1997, it reduced the value of such discounts in areas where councils were running short of housing stock. Critics said the policy resulted in speculators buying up valuable housing stock too cheaply. The Right to Buy Scheme was extended in the March 2013 Budget, as the government vowed to increase sales once again. By Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent, BBC News Before Mrs Thatcher arrived at No 10, British passports contained a special page to record the amount of cash travellers took out of the country. The page was one of the first things to be scrapped by the new government, as the Tories moved to abolish exchange controls. The Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, raised travel allowances to PS1,000 per trip and permitted overseas property purchases of up to PS100,000. On the tax front, the basic rate was cut by 3p to 30p in the pound, while the highest rate came down from 83p to 60p. But Thatcher's chancellors not only cut income tax, but also changed the way we pay tax. To fund lower taxes on incomes, up went tax on most things shoppers bought. VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8 to 15. Within a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor With money from tax cuts in their pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the \"feelgood factor.\" They were encouraged further as credit was unleashed. Restrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s. And, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window. Building societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete. The Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years. Mrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988. The new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, they backfired. The promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions. Compensating the victims cost the pensions industry PS11bn. More successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to PS6,000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break. To complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax-free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa. The idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have PS390bn salted away. By John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News Few senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that her reforms had on the power of the movement. She was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike. The Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job. Secret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day. In 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million. The miners' strike of 1984-85 came to symbolise the government's battle with the unions. The year-long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police. In the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever. Unions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish their power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress-affiliated unions. One of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged. By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News A policy of privatising the UK's large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such it was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had their critics. The recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership. By the end of its first term, it had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later. This led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK. One of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986. The promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to \"tell Sid\" about the chance to buy shares at \"affordable\" prices. Anyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid. Privatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing. It also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies. Yet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s. In 1981, 28 was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20 by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11 by the end of 2010. By Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News The impact of one of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK. The so-called \"Big Bang,\" introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange. The most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face. Big Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading. It also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen's club, ruled by restrictive practices. (It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.) Before Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor. Price competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm. At best it was a self-regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at its worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping. Big Bang saw many of the City's historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one-stop shops. This, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses. Big Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share-buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into their banks and order a parcel of shares. But while it made dealing and investing easier, it also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.",
        "Somebody had placed a garland of fresh flowers on the rusting wreckage of a tank. Men died here and were remembered. Although the fields were empty it was possible to imagine them filled with workers harvesting the sunflower crop. This was the lull, the space between bombardments when the land reminded us of its true purpose: not a battlefield but a place of abundance. I remarked to a colleague that the calm was our greatest enemy here. It lulled us into a false sense of ease. And then it started. I heard shouts of \"Go, go, go\" in English and Ukrainian. There were loud cracks and flashes in the fields nearby, then the surge of adrenalin; the fear - impossible to convey - of being caught in the open by artillery. Another small moment in the life of a war we have reported on for the past year. Much of that time has been spent in the villages around Donetsk airport, like Pisky. Of a pre-war population of 3,000, there are now only around 40 people left. We had come back to Pisky to spend a night in the company of a couple who refused to leave one of the most embattled places on the Ukrainian front. Anatoliy and Svetlana Kosse, both aged 68, were among the few residents still here. All around them were the ruins of houses struck by shellfire. Their days and nights are punctuated by the noise of artillery, rockets, mortars and gunfire. But alongside this murderous back and forth there was a more hopeful soundtrack. We heard it in the garden where Anatoliy tends his bees, in the kitchen where Svetlana cooked us dinner from the vegetables she grew and the eggs from her henhouse. It was the unrehearsed but determined music of life that refused to be yield in the face of war. The village sat close to Donetsk airport and on the frontline between the Government and rebel armies. There was no electricity or water. Food supplies were meagre: the couple survived on what they produced and on occasional aid deliveries. \"It is terrifying,\" said Svetlana. \"Before I only had a few grey hairs here. And now you can see. When I look at myself with my glasses on, it is terrifying.\" So why did they stay? Why did they not leave for the city? I asked these questions of Anatoliy as he tended the beehives. \"I am taking care of them, they are here, how can I just leave them?\" he replied. This was home. To leave would be to abandon all they had worked for. In fact Svetlana did move to the city for several months. Anatoliy stayed behind to take care of the home they had created together with its crop-filled garden, beehives and neat rows of flowers. We were sitting over dinner when Svetlana described what happened after she left. \"When he was alone here, every morning and evening we called each other. I had a strong pain in my soul and so did he. He was a lonely man here because all the neighbours moved away.\" So she returned. They decided to endure the danger and the stress. I asked Anatoliy what his wife meant to him. \"How can I explain what she means to me?\" he said. Then he smiled and leaned across and placed his head on her shoulder. They both laughed. The shelling and shooting went on. It was a perfectly clear, starlit sky. And below the stars, shining brightly, we could see the unmanned aerial drones searching for targets on the ground. When we left the following morning I told Anatoliy and Svetlana that in war I had met all kinds of people but they were among the nicest and bravest I'd ever come across. \"You make too much of us,\" Anatoliy replied. They laughed again. I was struck by how much laughter there was in this home. Every day now I read of fighting in Pisky; I think of the beekeeper and his wife and I curse the war that threatens such decent people.",

        "But once the votes are counted, what can residents expect to pay in council tax? Below are the figures for a Band D property for every council area in Wales for the current financial year of 201718, how much that has gone up by for the current year, and what the average property in the area actually pays. They are grouped here by police force region - council tax includes the police precept which is added to the overall bill paid by homes. Local government is not fully funded by council tax. Much of the funding for councils comes in the form of grants from the Welsh Government, which in turn gets its funding from the UK government in London. In 201718 a total of PS4.1bn is being divided among Wales' 22 councils. The lions share of council cash goes on schools - with social services following behind, as shown in the graph above. Residents pay council tax based on which band their property is in, based on its worth. Band D has historically been used as the standard for comparing council tax levels between and across local authorities. It is used to charge tax to a property that, in Wales, was worth between PS91,001 to PS123,000 on April 2003 values. Council tax gets lower the cheaper a property is, and higher the more expensive a property is. Council tax figures source: Welsh Government",
        "They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than PS450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy \"sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment.\" Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as \"sexier\" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. \"There's a huge market for our timber. Every saw miller tells me he would double or treble production if the timber was there to feed that mill,\" he added.",
        "The Scottish distance runner already had a certain inner steel and now likens herself to Arnold Schwarzenegger's iconic cyborg creation after acquiring a bit more in the aftermath of a broken ankle in January 2015. \"I already had five screws in my left foot and now I have another two and a metal plate in my ankle,\" the 25-year-old from Dundee explained. \"It is almost like a robot foot - I am slowly turning into The Terminator. \"I don't set off airport scanners yet, but it is certainly getting that way. It is just really unfortunate that it has always been my left foot.\" A top-two finish in Sunday's 5,000m at the British Championships, doubling as Olympic trials, would secure a place in the Great Britain team heading to Rio - a fitting reward for persistence in the face of adversity. As McColgan relates the \"long process\" of recovery from the initial ankle break, to further surgery last July, to jogging again, to issues with \"compensatory injuries\" and additional nerve problems, it is not hard to understand her surprise at the form she takes to Birmingham. The Scottish 3,000m steeplechase record holder has ditched the hurdles and water jumps to protect her vulnerable ankle and run personal bests in the 3,000m and 5,000m - the latter in her first track outing for 22 months - to achieve the Olympic qualifying standard. \"It has been an absolute blessing to come back as quickly as I have,\" she told BBC 5 live's Sports Panel recently. \"I honestly thought this year would be just about slowly building things up and just being happy to be running again. \"But my form has come back quite quickly. I put a lot of work in on the cross-trainer and in the gym and pool. I did everything I could apart from running. \"It is nice to be back running PBs over all distances and I am ready to race the trials now.\" Steve Cram, BBC Sport's athletics commentator, saw first hand what McColgan went through at a winter training camp for some of Britain's distance athletes in early February. \"I have got a lot of time for Eilish,\" Cram told BBC Scotland. \"I was with her in Kenya and she was still struggling then. \"But she never gives up on it. Everyone else was going out and doing their miles on the trails and Eilish was not able to run much at that point, but she was going into the gym and running on the machines. \"She threw herself into that rehab with an incredible amount of energy. Her motivation stayed high and that is why she has come out the other end of it. \"We have got three or four girls who are doing well at the 5K this year, but if Eilish can re-produce her form at the trials, hopefully she will be in Rio.\" Fellow Scottish 5,000m runners Steph Twell (14:59.00) and Laura Whittle (15:08.58) have both run faster this year than the 15:09.94 McColgan posted in California in early May. But, given her rapid progress since returning to the track, you wouldn't bet against her, even if she admits the reward of an Olympics spot brings added pressures. \"Preparing to put on a GB vest is completely different for me to competing in a Diamond League or a smaller race,\" she explained. \"The Olympics is the pinnacle of sport, it is what you spend years training for and dreaming of. \"It is definitely a lot more intense and there are a lot more nerves on the start line knowing the opportunity to make the team is up for grabs. \"It is like another level of competition up, but it is one you have prepared for. \"You are still running and racing and doing exactly what you have trained to do. But the whole environment is a little bit more pressurised.\" McColgan has already competed at an Olympics, missing out on the final of the 3,000m steeplechase in London four years ago. She concedes switching to the 5,000m so close to Rio is \"quite a scary change particularly in such a competitive event. But, considering the alternative, the risk-reward decision became clear. \"I can run and get through the aches and pains of my ankle, but the impact of jumping in the steeplechase is just too much of a risk,\" she said. \"It is my favourite event, but if it meant I had to sit on the sidelines for another year, I think mentally it would have been very, very difficult. \"I just love running and it would have been silly to risk it to try to make the team for Rio. I just wouldn't be confident mentally.\" If McColgan requires any further inspiration on the road to Rio, she only has to look at her coach, and mother, Liz McColgan-Nuttall. The 1991 world 10,000m champion, two-time Commonwealth gold medallist and London Marathon winner, who also won Olympics silver, was famous for her belligerence and grit. \"My mum is a huge inspiration to me,\" says her daughter. \"So many people come up to me and say'I used to watch your mum running 25 years ago, it is amazing to see you doing it'. \"She is still inspiring people today. It is really nice to hear that about someone who's not just your coach but your mum. \"There is something very different about her persona. She is very motivated and hard-driven. She was just so dedicated to what she did. \"It is a mentality thing. She has got a fighting mentality and that is what makes people legends in their sport - they have a different mentality to other people. \"You don't know why that is or how it has happened, but there is something unique about them.\" And possibly their offspring too. Bringing home precious metal from Rio would be a huge stretch for McColgan or any of the Brits in a women's event dominated by the leading Ethiopians and Kenyans. But just getting there at all would be cause enough for celebration.",
        "Sir Timothy O'Shea said plans to elect the chair of universities' governing bodies were \"inconsistent, incoherent and potentially very damaging.\" The proposal is made in the Scottish government's Higher Education Governance Bill. The Scottish government said it would continue to listen to all views. The bill aims to improve the way universities - which are fiercely protective of their independence from the state - are governed. Although universities get a large chunk of their income from the Scottish government, unlike schools and colleges they are not part of the public sector or directly accountable to politicians. The proposal which has caused the most controversy is for directly elected chairs for university courts - students and staff would be able to take part in the vote. But this is seen by some as a threat to the role of the rector at the ancient universities. The role of the rector is sometimes seen as purely symbolic and ceremonial. However, supporters argue the best rectors can be powerful ambassadors for their universities and champions of the students' interests. Prof Sir Timothy said amendments to the bill could prove damaging to his university. He said the amendments would allow for two elected positions playing a chairing role in the university - a rector and a senior lay member. This would suggest changing what he described as the \"the long-established and well-understood role of our rector - without any prior consultation or discussion.\" He also argued the senior lay member would appear to have significantly weaker powers than their counterparts at other universities - without any prior consultation. Sir Timothy said: \"The amendments are inconsistent, incoherent and potentially very damaging for one of Scotland's major universities. \"There has been no consultation or discussion with us, or the wider sector on the implications, which require careful consultation and scrutiny otherwise there is a real risk of perverse and possibly unintended consequences.\" He argued it could even significantly impede the university's ability to contribute to the economic and social good of the country. He urged Holyrood's education committee to ask the government to withdraw these amendments until they have consulted with those affected on the implications of their proposals. However, Sir Timothy also welcomed amendments to the bill, including one which removed some additional ministerial powers that he argued threatened the university's institutional autonomy. A Scottish government spokesperson said: \"The Higher Education Governance Bill aims to ensure that the entire campus community has a say on how our higher education institutions are governed. \"We have worked closely with the sector over the course of the bill's development and will continue to listen to the views of all interested parties and consider all constructive suggestions as the bill continues to be considered by parliament. \"The detail of how a rector and new elected senior lay member would work together would remain, as now, a matter for each autonomous institution to address. The bill does not change that.\" The Scottish government said any expansion in the role of the rector in a higher education institution beyond the current role set out in statute would be a matter for each institution. \"We think that the post of senior lay member should be an elected one,\" the spokesperson said. \"This role is pivotal in the leadership of all Scottish institutions, and all staff and students should have their say in appointing the best candidate for the role. \"The model for appointment of the senior lay member proposed by the Scottish Government has been discussed with stakeholders.\"",
        "The pastor and his family eventually fled Chibok in September after repeated attacks by the militants. They moved to the nearby town of Mubi until it also came under attack the next month and now live in Minna in the north-west. The family now scrapes a living by selling firewood and as Rev Mark tells the BBC's Chris Ewokor, the 12 months since the abductions have felt like \"like 10 years.\" Since the abduction of Monica and Sarah we've been in some kind of condition but I cannot describe it. We are not able to sleep. My wife [has been having] this problem with her blood pressure, we have been struggling, at times when I come and see her alone I meet her crying, at times she cannot eat especially when it was in the early days just after these girls were abducted. We set a day that we fast and pray so that the Lord will strengthen our daughters and all the abducted Chibok girls, if they are still alive. My biological daughter Monica, she was 20 at that time she was abducted, and Sarah Samuel [my adopted daughter] was 18. That day, 14 April, was a very dangerous day. I remember hearing gunshots - all the buildings in Chibok were shaking. We have little mountains there and they were was echoing the shooting sound. When we went to the bush, I asked them [my wife and small children] to continue walking but I watched what was going and and saw how they were setting fire on some buildings until the morning. I managed to get back to my house and took my machine [motorbike]. I went to the school, no pupils were there. I asked about them and was told that they have taken our daughters, and they showed me the direction they went. We saw that the girls had dropped their head scarves and dropped shoes along the way. So I used that as a guide to follow where they went. Somebody told me that my daughter jumped out of the vehicle and she was wounded and she could not walk. It encouraged me to continue to pursue them. I went to a village which the kidnappers had set fire to and passed through it. I went to the next village and was told that the kidnappers had somebody and that should go back. I just went into the bush to keep on looking and I met two girls - Sarah Lawan and a daughter of my watchman. I took them on my machine to the house. They [had] jumped out of the big lorry that was carrying them - if you would have seen the dust on them, you would have pitied them. So it was those girls who gave me the information that they were kidnapped. When I was in Chibok, there were some members of Boko Haram who mixed with us, so we did get some information though it was not first hand and we did not know if it was true or not. I was told that my daughter was stoned to death soon after being kidnapped and I was told that my daughter had been asked her to receive the Prophet Muhammad as her saviour. She refused [and] I was told that they dug a hole and buried her leaving her head outside and stoned her to death. But [an envoy of the government who has been negotiating with the Boko Haram] just some three weeks ago he called me and told me that my daughters' names are among the names of the girls they are expecting [to be freed] which shows she is still alive, according to what he told me. I have hope. Even if my daughter has been stoned to death, I am the happiest man as a man of God who has brought up my daughter with that kind of faith. I always think that had it been President Goodluck [Jonathan], or the defence minister or the chief defence minister or the governor of Borno state or those senators, who had lost a daughter, how would they feel? At the time these girls were kidnapped, had the federal government paid careful attention they would have rescued these girls. I'm not blaming the federal government but it's their responsibility to bring the girls back. When I remember the future of my [other] children it makes me to shed tears, I don't know how we will end up. Since the kidnapping none of my children has been to school. Monica, she's very neat in everything and she's prayerful all the time. And one thing that makes me to remember her all the time, [she said] \"Daddy I'm praying for you that you will be able to sponsor me, I want to be a doctor I want to help the nation.\" That's all these things that I remember - and her determination.",
        "Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show 3.7 million workers travel for two hours or longer every weekday. Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress, which published the figures, called on employers to do more to prevent \"excessive\" journeys. The average daily commute lasted 57.1 minutes in 2015, the ONS data showed. Ms O'Grady blamed stagnant wages for bulging commuting times, paired with high house prices and rental costs. \"Employers cannot turn a blind eye to this problem,\" she said. \"Long commutes eat into our family time and can be bad for our working lives too.\" Back in 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more, compared with 3.7 million today, according to the ONS's Labour Force Survey. The survey, which is based on responses from nearly 90,000 workers and excludes those who work from home, found that: The TUC said workers were now less likely to be able to afford to live near their places of work. The cost of renting a home in the UK rose faster than the cost of living in the year to September, according to ONS figures. Meanwhile, UK property prices saw an 8.4 annual increase up to August. Longer periods travelling to and from work have therefore become an accepted part of many people's daily routine. \"It makes life difficult but it's become the norm,\" said Nick Seymour, a solicitor from Exeter, who spends at least three hours a day travelling by car and train to and from Bristol. Once a week, he also travels to his firm's office in Cardiff - a four-hour-plus round-trip. \"I've been doing this for months and am surprised how many people do the same route,\" he said. Mr Seymour, 43, said the PS5,000 cost of train tickets, not including petrol and parking, was worth it to avoid the upheaval of relocating. \"I am considering moving, but my wife and son are based here in Exeter,\" he said. The compromise is missing out on eight-year-old son Harry's parents' evenings and school plays - not to mention delays and crowded trains. \"It can be a daily nightmare,\" he said. \"I normally stand because it's too busy, which is frustrating if you've had a long day.\" Other commuters are going to great lengths to avoid overcrowded or delayed trains. Phil Cresswell, who works in media advertising, cycles 230 miles a week on his daily journey from Leatherhead in Surrey to central London. He says spending his \"14th winter\" on the bicycle is worth it to save \"several thousands of pounds a year\" on train tickets as well as the cost of a gym membership. \"I live on the edge of the Surrey hills and it's great for cycling,\" he said. Mr Cresswell, 51, admits that some people think the 46-mile round trip is extreme. \"But I think sitting on trains or buses for similar times going nowhere is extreme,\" he said. Another unconventional commuter is Sam Cookney, who recently packed in his own five-and-a-half-hour round trip between Barcelona and London. In a blog post in 2013, he explained that flying from Barcelona for four days a week was cheaper than renting a flat in the capital. Mr Cookney, 33, moved to Barcelona last year but decided making the trip four times a week would be \"excessive,\" and instead travelled to London a few times a month. \"Sadly I'm no longer commuting and living back in London,\" he said.",

By Clive ColemanBBC News legal correspondent This latest round of settlements represents a continued waving of the white flag by News International in the civil cases for breach of privacy arising out of the phone hacking at the former News of the World. The vast majority of the original 60-odd cases have now been settled. And the more they settle, the more difficult it becomes for News International to defend one. The case brought by the singer Charlotte Church and her family is due for trial, as are five other cases. Whether any of them will actually get there seems doubtful. The settlement sums reflect the level of hacking, the period over which it took place and the number of articles that were written based upon the information hacked. But this is not even the beginning of the end. Waiting in the wings, are around 800 additional potential claimants, perhaps more. News International seems to be in for a very long and very costly act of surrender. Speaking outside the High Court, Mr Coogan said he had taken the action to expose the way in which parts of the press had been operating. \"Like other people who sued, I was determined to do my part to show the depths to which the press can sink in pursuit of private information. \"The police and the Leveson Inquiry will be investigating these matters but at the time, when these civil cases began, News International seemed likely to succeed in covering up the hacking scandal completely. \"Neither the police nor the government were willing to hold those responsible accountable for unlawful acts.\" He said some of the phone hacking victims were \"many ordinary members of the public, sometimes vulnerable people with the most tenuous connection to news.\" Mr Campbell said he would be using the settlement to make donations to organisations, including the Labour Party and Mind, \"so that at least some small good for the causes I believe in can come out of the criminality and cultural depravity of others.\" \"For me, this has been about people with a voice and a platform using them to change the media culture which, as I argued at the Leveson Inquiry, has become putrid in parts,\" he said. The announcement of the latest settlements, at a hearing in London, came during the latest in a number of pre-trial reviews. Mr Campbell said his settlement was a \"satisfactory outcome\" and NGN had agreed to search for other documents and that he may be entitled to further damages. Details of the effect hacking had on Mr Gascoigne were given in a statement from his solicitor. The judge was told the former England international footballer, who also played for Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, had been the subject of a number of News of the World articles over many years and had \"considerable concerns\" about the source of some of the \"intrusive and private\" information. The statement said: \"Mr Gascoigne was worried that the information was being obtained by bugging or tapping his telephone conversations, as a result of which he was accused of being paranoid. \"In addition, Mr Gascoigne was worried that the information was being given to the News of the World by his friends or family, as a result of which he fell out with several of his friends and family.\" The statement said the ex-footballer apologised for wrongly accusing those close to him of leaking information. Those receiving settlements include: Liberal Democrat deputy leader Mr Hughes said the practice of hacking was \"criminal behaviour on an industrial scale.\" He added: \"We must now make sure that nothing like this can ever happen again.\" These latest developments mean 15 more phone hacking cases have now been settled, including nine of the 10 which were due to go to civil trial on Monday. There were 37 other claims settled with NGN last month. The announcement, at a hearing in London, came during the latest in a number of pre-trial reviews. Another five phone-hacking cases are still due to be heard. Those are of model Elle Macpherson's former adviser Mary Ellen Field, footballer Ryan Giggs, former royal butler Paul Burrell, police officer Jacqui Hames and her husband David Cook, and PR consultant Nicola Phillips.",
        "The train firm said it would refund the difference in cost between mainline and high speed fares - to compensate for the loss of direct high speed trains. Southeastern will also give season ticket-holders from five stations a backdated 20 refund on mainline fares. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke, said the line still needed repairing quickly. He said it had been a difficult time for rail users and it was right passengers should be compensated after the problems were caused when cracks appeared in the sea wall. Mr Elphicke said an emergency peak-time high-speed rail service between Dover and St Pancras to help commuters had made a difference. \"We now need Network Rail to confirm how long it will take to repair the sea wall,\" he said. Steve Kilby, from Network Rail, said the team was working hard to get a final design in place for repairs. But, he said: \"This week has been very stormy on the beach and our guys have been working through tough conditions.\" He said 15,000 tonnes of rock had been placed on the shingle to protect the railway from heavy seas and eventually more than 70,000 tonnes would be in place. The stations where passengers will be compensated are Sandwich, Deal, Walmer, Martin Mill and Dover Priory. Compensation claim forms are available for people at the station.",

Backs Tyler Morgan and Dan Biggar plus hooker Scott Baldwin joined Wales' list of injured players during the game. \"We don't want to make any excuses. South Africa won.... and we weren't good enough to win,\" said Gatland. \"At the end of the day South Africa did what South Africa do. They got one chance and they took it and that was the result.\" Wales lost a trio of front-line stars in centre Jonathan Davies, full-back Leigh Halfpenny and scrum-half Rhys Webb to long-term injuries before the tournament began. Two more centres - Cory Allen and Scott Williams - were then forced out of action in the opening two pool games against Uruguay and England, with wing Hallam Amos joining them. Wales then lost the versatile Liam Williams - a full-back or wing - during their punishing final pool match against Australia.

The player remonstrated with WRU medical manager Prav Mathema and team doctor Geoff Davies, but Gatland backed the decision. \"That's a medical call,\" he said. \"They took him off the field for a head injury assessment; it looked like he'd got a bit of a knock, he looked unsteady on his feet. \"He obviously felt that he was OK, but we support our medical team 100 so there's no issues on that from the coaching set-up.\" 'We knew it was going to come down to fine margins,\" said a \"proud\" skipper Sam Warburton, who lamented what he felt was a premature end to the campaign. \"It's a quiet changing room - it's hard to find the words, it's all so raw,\" he said. \"It feels premature with two weeks of the competition left. We've been together since June and all those gruelling camps... it's over, done and dusted.\" Warburton praised the players who had come in to replace the casualties, saying: \"The guys who've stepped in have done a fantastic job. This could be the last World Cup for many of us, but we go out with no regrets.\" Warburton was sent off in Wales' 9-8 World Cup semi-final defeat by France in 2011, and after this latest disappointment said: \"Hopefully I will be around when one of these tight ones goes our way.\"",

        "The region's number of under 15s taking alcohol remains above the national average, according to the Highland Alcohol and Drugs Partnership. Its campaign Meet the MacPhersons draws on evidence gathered from 200 young people and 20 parents. They were asked for their experiences of the dilemmas faced by children, teenagers and parents in relation to alcohol. Almost three quarters of young people in the Highlands have drunk alcohol by the time they turn 15, according to the partnership, whose members include NHS Highland. The partnership said there has been a 10 reduction in underage drinking in the region since 2010, but it remained above the national average. Deborah Stewart, co-ordinator for Highland Alcohol and Drugs Partnership, said families have an important part to play in tackling underage drinking. She said: \"Underage drinking remains a concern as it contributes to a range of negative health and social outcomes. \"There is also evidence that shows early alcohol use is associated with increased risk of dependency in adulthood and chronic diseases associated with excessive drinking in adults. \"By reducing underage drinking we can reduce the risk of alcohol problems developing in adulthood and families can play a part in that by modelling sensible drinking, communicating risks associated with drinking and participating in positive activities. That's why we would like families to Meet the MacPhersons.\" Last month, NHS Highland's director of public health said children as young as three can recognise the smell associated with alcohol. Dr Hugo van Woerden said he recognised that responsible drinking was \"a normal part of a healthy society.\" But he has raised concerns about levels of alcohol abuse and children's exposure to it. He said in the health board's area 9.4 of men and 7.2 of women were classed as problem drinkers. His report mentions \"children as young as three can recognise the smell associated with alcoholic drinks.\" Dr van Woerden also said there had been a rise in alcohol intake by women aged 16-24.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device The 34-year-old, who won 10,000m gold eight days ago, was swamped by his rivals in the final lap and Ethiopia's Muktar Edris broke clear to win gold. Britain's Farah kicked again to take silver at the London Stadium in his final major track championships. Britain's men won a stunning 4x100m relay gold as the women took silver. \"It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,\" Farah told BBC Sport. \"It didn't quite hit home until after I crossed the line and had a couple of moments to myself when I realised - this is it. \"I gave it all - I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\" Four-time Olympic champion Farah will finish his track career with a record of 10 golds and two silvers in major championships. He is set to focus on marathons after his final track appearance at the 5,000m Diamond League final in Zurich on 24 August. Gold and silver in the two 4x100m relays takes Britain's medal tally at London 2017 to four - Farah supplying the other two - but the hosts are still two short of UK Sport's target of six to eight. Edris, 23, ran a superbly judged final 600m to claim his first major title with a sprint finish reminiscent of so many Farah triumphs. After a brief burst from Farah's compatriot Andrew Butchart at the front of the race, the Ethiopian trio of Edris, Yomif Kejelcha and Selemon Barega moved up to box in the home favourite. Barega fell back but Edris used Kejelcha as a pace-setter into the home straight before surging away while Farah battled for position with the resurgent Paul Chelimo behind. Farah finally found open track but Edris was gone, with the Briton passing the fading Kejelcha and holding off Chelimo to salvage silver. \"The 10,000m took a lot more out of me than I realised,\" said Farah. \"I was trying to cover every move but they had a game plan - one of them was going to sacrifice himself and that's what they did and the better man won.\" Farah has now lost just two of his 22 5,000m contests since 2011. \"I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,\" said Edris, who won in a time of 13 minutes 32.79 seconds to claim his first win over the Briton in five attempts. \"I am the new champion for Ethiopia, that's why I did the'Mobot' [Farah's traditional celebration] - I am the next champion.\" 1976 Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist and BBC commentator Brendan Foster: \"We did say fatigue was going to get him. It has to come to an end. He hates losing.\" BBC athletics expert Allison Curbishley: \"In my head and my heart I didn't think anyone could genuinely beat Mo Farah but that 10,000m at the start of the week took so much out of him. Edris, we take our hat off to you. This man has beaten the legend that is Mo Farah in his own back yard.\" 2005 marathon world champion Paul Radcliffe: \"He just doesn't have the pace in his legs anymore to be able to live with challengers like that but this isn't the end of Mo Farah in athletics. He has a new challenge ahead of him in the marathon.\" Two-time Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson: \"He has got to be hurting. But it has to end for everybody. In a couple of weeks or months, he will look back and say,'that was awesome'.\" 2004 Olympic 4x100m relay champion Darren Campbell: \"There are athletes out there who have won more medals, but the quality of those medals and for Mo to have led an event on his own.... wow. I don't know how you can't see him as our greatest ever athlete.\" Media playback is not supported on this device A disconsolate Farah dropped to the track as Edris mimicked his famous celebration, before finally picking himself up to complete a farewell lap. Farah has come under scrutiny in recent years, with his coach Alberto Salazar under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency. The Briton also recently denied any wrongdoing after computer hackers revealed some of his blood samples had initially been flagged as suspicious, before later being declared normal. After initial shock at the result, the crowd found their voice to give Farah a final warm send-off at the stadium he lit up with double Olympic gold in 2012. \"Back in 2008 at the Olympics I was so disappointed [at not making the 5,000m final] and I didn't know what to do with myself, whether to carry on with the sport,\" said Farah. \"I had to decide what it took to become a champion and that was to move to the other side of the world - nothing was guaranteed but I took that chance. \"This London crowd is amazing - there is no place like home. \"I have a few more races on the track, then I will take a short break and then this chapter of my life is closed.\" Elsewhere, Britons Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Morgan Lake finished fifth and sixth respectively in the high jump as Maria Lasitskene - the Russian competing as a neutral athlete - won gold with a leap of 2.03m. And Ashley Bryant finished 11th in the men's decathlon, with Kevin Mayer becoming the first French world champion in the event. Media playback is not supported on this device",
        "Ross Thomson and Graham Simpson filled in a giant ballot paper outside Holyrood to underline their support for the Vote Leave campaign. Fellow Tory MSP Margaret Mitchell also backs Brexit, but party leader Ruth Davidson is in favour of remaining in. Meanwhile, the Scottish remain campaign highlighted how much research funding universities receive from the EU. Campaigning outside the Scottish Parliament alongside Scottish Vote Leave director and former Labour MP Tom Harris, the two newly-elected MSPs underlined their support for Brexit. Mr Thomson said that with moves towards further centralisation, \"Europe is going in a direction that Britain can't follow.\" He said: \"I think if we had a Europe where there was real reform and was focused again on our trading relationship, that's something I could have supported. But I just feel that at the moment, the direction of travel in the EU is about further political centralisation, further political union. \"I've always been fairly Eurosceptic, but when the Prime Minister said he was going to have a referendum and get a better deal it was something I was really keen on, and in fairness to him he put a Herculean effort in. \"But I'm concerned that there's no treaty change. I'm concerned that heads of state are temporary - if the German chancellor loses an election or isn't returned, and the same with the other heads of state, that negotiation we've achieved isn't long-term.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has voiced support for the UK remaining in the EU, but Mr Thomson said she was \"really relaxed\" about her MSPs taking the opposite view. He added: \"She said,'I've made a personal decision based on my experience - I want to stay in but I respect that you and others will make their own personal decision'. \"Ruth is really relaxed, saying we're going to have a grown-up, adult debate about the facts and our visions for the future, and I look forward to engaging in that properly.\" Meanwhile, the Scotland Stronger in Europe campaign have been highlighting the contribution the EU makes to university research funding. Writing in the Herald newspaper, Glasgow University principal Prof Anton Muscatelli said there was \"unequivocal\" evidence that \"universities in Scotland and the UK benefit massively from our membership of the EU.\" He said: \"Scotland's universities receive PS88.8m a year from EU sources, which is about 13 of our total research funding. \"This includes research to fight malaria, research on space, and vital medical research which benefits us all.\" Dundee University principal Prof Pete Downes has also warned of an impact on funding from Brexit, saying universities would be \"impoverished\" by a vote to leave the EU. Scotland Stronger in Europe spokesman John Edward said: \"Being in the EU is clearly fundamental to pan-European academic collaborations and the success of Scotland's universities, which in turn underpins jobs and investment.\"",
        "It has been a great experience for me to be involved with Melbourne and winning the Australian Women's Grand Final against Perth Glory is another career highlight. We made history by being the first team to retain their title and that is phenomenal. To fly away from home and win it 2-0 truly was one of the best feelings I've had in a long time. The big difference for me this year is being involved as a player-manager, rather than just a midfielder. Is it a hard adjustment to make? Absolutely. It's very hard to deal with. It's very mentally and physically draining, but it's equally very rewarding in different ways. When the final whistle went at the weekend it made every second of the season worthwhile. The juice was definitely worth the squeeze. Being a manager is a very difficult thing to do and you have to have a very good group of players and coaches for it to work. Thankfully and luckily we did have that. I have thought about getting into coaching, but the way this came about was more to do with circumstances than anything else. Our head coach (Jo Montemurro) went into our men's side as an assistant and I stepped up. It was a natural thing, really. We were so far into the season that it was probably going to be the least disruptive for everyone involved. I didn't think twice about it when the (Melbourne) City group asked me to do the job. Equally I knew that it would be OK with the group that we had, because we have a very, very good group of girls. For me, at the stage of my career, this is the best of both worlds. I want to learn how to coach and how to develop as a coach and I believe I'm in the best place for that. But I'm not anywhere near retiring right now so I'm still playing and loving my football. I believe coaching educates me as a player as much as me learning as a coach pushes me out of my comfort zone. After an absolutely amazing experience in Melbourne, I head home soon to meet up with Wales ahead of the Cyprus Cup. I'm going to stay with Wales for another campaign after briefly considering international retirement and am really excited to get back to prepare for our World Cup campaign that will start later this year. My experiences with Melbourne can stand me in really good stead for Wales and my American club side Seattle Reign. I just go as a player to those camps, but I do have experience in leading groups and being a good person who helps when they're in a bit of trouble or being successful. The experience of this whole campaign I've just had with City is probably one of a kind. I certainly want to continue in football beyond playing, but who knows if the opportunity will ever be there to coach in the men's game. I think it'll be a lot easier for women to go into the male game in the future, in the right environment, as I had in Melbourne. At Melbourne, everyone believes in and supports each other and the crossover between male and female is very similar and even. In that environment I can't see it being a problem. But that environment is not replicated all over the world. Some clubs would be very receptive to a female coach, other clubs less so. But luckily, that is not something I have to worry about for a good few years yet!",
        "The \"witches' marks\" were often carved near entrances to buildings, including the house where Shakespeare was born and the Tower of London. The symbols were believed to offer protection when belief in witchcraft and the supernatural was widespread. But heritage agency Historic England says too little is known about them. This Halloween it is calling for people to document the marks, which can be found in medieval houses, churches and other buildings, most commonly from around 1550 to 1750. The symbols, which were intended to protect inhabitants and visitors of buildings from witches and evil spirits, took many forms, including patterns and sometimes letters. The most common type was the \"Daisy Wheel,\" which looked like a flower drawn with a compass in a single endless line that was supposed to confuse and entrap evil spirits. They also took the form of letters, such as AM for Ave Maria, M for Mary or VV, for Virgin of Virgins, scratched into medieval walls, engraved on wooden beams and etched into plasterwork to evoke the protective power of the Virgin Mary. Known examples include several found at Shakespeare's birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, carved near the cellar door where beer was kept, and at the Tithe Barn, Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, to protect crops. Others have been found in caves, such as the Witches' Chimney at Wookey Hole, Somerset, which has numerous markings. Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"Witches' marks are a physical reminder of how our ancestors saw the world. \"They really fire the imagination and can teach us about previously-held beliefs and common rituals. \"Ritual marks were cut, scratched or carved into our ancestors' homes and churches in the hope of making the world a safer, less hostile place. \"They were such a common part of everyday life that they were unremarkable and because they are easy to overlook, the recorded evidence we hold about where they appear and what form they take is thin.\"",

He said that the school had strict anti-drugs and anti-smoking policies. He wrote: \"Breaches of the policy are treated with the utmost seriousness, with the resulting disciplinary decisions reached after full and thorough consideration of the facts and circumstances. \"I and my senior colleagues have been addressing these incidents directly and believe that we have taken appropriate action in support of the school's standpoint that such behaviour cannot be tolerated.\"",
        "Ancient sites like Palmyra have suffered destruction, and it is feared that hundreds of precious valuables have been smuggled out of the country to be sold on the international art market. Art specialist Christopher Marinello is chief executive of the Art Recovery Group, which has retrieved US500m (PS330m) of stolen and looted works of art over the past decade. He spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about what can be done to help stop the theft of the country's precious antiquities. \"We've been aware of smuggled goods from Syria for some time. As a lawyer in New York, I represented a lot of galleries, auction houses and dealers that had problems bringing items in and out of the United States. So I was very aware of the smuggling routes that take place, and the traffic that is involved with antiquities. \"What's happened now is Isis and other people are taking advantage of the war in Syria to tap into these markets and sell their goods on a worldwide basis. \"You've got some very poor people doing the digging, and selling to a middleman who moves the objects on to Lebanon, through Beirut into Turkey and then into the Western world. We've heard reports of Isis taxing the trade, up to around 20. \"The number one funding for Isis is oil, and after that, kidnapping and ransom demands. When they don't have access to those, they look for something else, and the antiquities in their backyard have provided a natural source for income. \"Stopping this crisis requires a multi-faceted approach, where number one is [to] stop the war. Number two is to increase awareness of collectors and dealers and auction houses not to purchase material that has no provenance. \"We are just one small portion of the solution: we run the Art Claim database. We have donated our services to museums and anyone on the ground who wants to identify works that are being looted. A museum can download its entire collection and say'put this on your database; if anything ever appears in the marketplace, it's not authorised to be sold'. \"As soon as the conflict happened in Syria, we reached out to our contacts on the ground to put everything they could on the database, even before it was stolen. Syria's riches \"Once a looted object is reported to us, it goes onto the database. Then we check the sales catalogues of all the major auction houses. We've got teams of people checking eBay, Amazon, other sale venues. We're also a very sophisticated searchable database with visual recognition software, so dealers and collectors contact us and say'I'm about to buy something' or'someone's approached me with something. Should I buy it? Is it on your database?' \"The first thing we look at is the provenance. Where did you get it from? Do you have a receipt? Was there a history that was given to you? We can't always rely on it because we've known the smugglers to falsify provenance information. But we look at what was given. And we're pretty adept at determining whether it's legitimate or not or whether it was made up or whether it's completely absent. \"We then notify the authorities. We are a free service to law enforcement. They know that if they place objects on our database, we will tell them where they are. We turn over all the information. I'm about to go to Venice at the invitation of the Italian government, and that follows Poland and Romania and Bulgaria and other governments. \"We have several hundred thousand objects on our database, and that's only since March, 2015. It's growing exponentially. The FBI database has just 15,000 objects. The Interpol database has about 40,000 objects. The Italian police have a fantastic database, and next year they will be changing it to work with Interpol. \"But they're not actually checking the marketplace the way we are. They don't have the funds to do that. They don't have the manpower. \"The Italians have done it right: they've got 300 officers dedicated to art crime. But let's look at the United States: a 320 million population with just 16 FBI agents in the art crime team. And they're also assigned to bomb duty as well. \"Here in London there are just a handful of in the art crime unit. They are overworked, underpaid and the whole department could use an overhaul. \"We've noticed a big jump in dealers and collectors checking with us, and that is evidence of fear. \"In the US, the FBI has issued a declaration that anybody who is found to have been purchasing looted Syrian objects could be prosecuted under a US Federal Law about funding international terrorism. That's pretty scary. \"We've seen some wild reports that the markets are being flooded with this material, but we haven't seen the really high-end antiquities getting here. We know of a recent container that was seized here in the UK with a great deal of Syrian looted objects on it, and I can't go too much beyond that because it's a current investigation here in the UK. \"But other than that container, we're seeing a lot of low-level material, and a lot of fakes. A lot of people are trying to take advantage of the situation and send fakes through and pretend that they're real. \"The better, more reputable auction houses do not want to sell this type of material in their sales room. It's the lower to mid-level dealer that [poses the risk]. It's that way with fine art as well: you always have those people who are looking to get a good deal without asking any questions. \"That's a big threat because it creates a market, and as long as there's a market for this type of illicit and looted material, it's going to be dug out of the ground. And when you have a situation like we have in Syria - where the government is near collapse, and there's no authority to really stop the export of this type of material - you have chaos.\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT13:05 BST.

        "The drones were designed to bring the internet to remote rural areas, complementing its Loon project - a similar initiative using hot air balloons. However, the solar-powered vehicles have faced technical difficulties and funding challenges. On Wednesday, blog 9to5 Google revealed Titan had actually shut in early 2016. A statement from X, the Google division responsible for Titan, confirmed the news. \"Titan was brought into X in late 2015. We ended our exploration of high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles for internet access shortly after,\" it said. \"By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world.\" Google acquired Titan Aerospace in 2014, reportedly fending off a bid from Facebook, which has also been trialling internet-providing drones. At the time Google said it was \"early days,\" but that \"atmospheric satellites could help bring internet access to millions of people, and help solve other problems, including disaster relief and environmental damage like deforestation.\" However, after test flights began in 2015, reports alleged that Titan was facing technical difficulties and was running out of money. In mid-2015, the Titan team also experienced a crash in the Arizona desert which was later linked to a wing fault. The statement added that \"many\" Titan staff had been reassigned to different parts of the business, including Project Loon and Wing, a division dedicated to providing drone-based deliveries. Facebook's internet drones have also faced problems. The firm's Aquila drone crashed during a test flight in June, prompting an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, and an explosion destroyed one of its satellites earlier in 2016.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device Benteke becomes the Reds' second most expensive signing, on what the club describe as a \"long-term contract.\" Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for PS49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for PS7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: \"I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. \"It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project.\" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the PS75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: \"He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. \"That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. \"He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well.\" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: \"He gives something different, a massive presence up front. \"It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. \"He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad. \"I'm a lot more optimistic than I was this time last year. The strikers only scored eight goals last year, we can only do better than that going forward.\" Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device GB finished bottom of the Pool stage in London with no wins and only three goals scored, but produced their best performance in an enthralling fifthsixth place play-off. Alex Danson scored a match-winning hat-trick, with Lily Owsley also on target. \"We didn't lose belief and we are delighted,\" Danson told BBC Sport. \"Obviously I'm delighted [with the three goals] but not just for me, from a whole team perspective because we can build on that performance leading into the summer.\" Head coach Danny Kerry admitted \"harsh words\" were spoken after Britain's 4-1 defeat by Australia on Saturday, but was please with how his team responded. \"We've had a tough tournament and they know that yesterday wasn't good enough, but today they really committed,\" he told BBC Sport. Danson struck her first goal of the tournament in the 10th minute, but Anita McLaren drew New Zealand level in the second period. Owsley and Danson struck either side of half-time to take GB clear, but back came the Kiwis with goals from Olivia Merry and Kelsey Smith made the score 3-3. Danson needed time out after being struck in the head by the ball, but recovered to deliver a composed lofted finish over New Zealand keeper Sally Rutherford to win Britain the match. \"Although we conceded a few today, which we need to work on, overall that was much better,\" captain Kate Richardson-Walsh told BBC Sport. \"We have a lot to learn, huge amounts, but it's good we're doing that now and can take that forward to Rio.\" British selectors will reveal the 16 women and 16 men who have been chosen to represent Team GB at this summer's Rio Olympics on Tuesday.",

Despite a cameo from Chesham's Barry Hayles, 43, Gary Liddle and Devante Cole scored in injury time. Chesham reached the second round after claiming their first ever Football League club scalp by defeating League Two Bristol Rovers, one of Hayles' former teams.

Bradford manager Phil Parkinson: \"We spoke to the lads about the experience of playing non-league teams last year and and what had to be done to get through. \"We enjoyed the fantastic ties against Chelsea and Sunderland last year, but a lot of hard work had to be done to earn those, and we've done it here. \"If we went back down to Chelsea we wouldn't argue with that.

        "The eggs command a high price from farms which produce meat, leather and other goods, so there are plenty of people willing to take on the risky job. But whether this derring-do should be legal or not has become a hot topic in the state of Queensland, where the government is reviewing its crocodile management plan. Proponents say legalisation in the neighbouring Northern Territory brought substantial economic benefits, particularly to indigenous communities, without affecting crocodile numbers. Critics, though, say it is not right to take the eggs, as most are already lost to inundation or predation. Leichhardt Federal MP and former crocodile farmer Warren Entsch says few people understand the crocodile industry and \"it's easy to bring emotional claptrap.\" He told the BBC he strongly supports legalising egg harvesting in Queensland. He would like to see a quota of eggs taken from nests, harvested, then sold to farmers who supply skins to global fashion houses. Mr Entsch said the number of saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory had grown substantially despite the provision for egg harvesting, with current estimates putting their population at around 100,000. \"Now there are more crocodiles [in the Northern Territory] than before when the'white fella' came to Australia,\" said Mr Entsch. \"The proliferation of the crocodile is huge and that in itself is causing a few problems.\" But conservationists say only a few crocodiles reach maturity in the wild and removing eggs could have a devastating impact. \"We're playing God to a degree, there's a reason why their [survival rates] are so low, because only the strongest fittest baby will survive,\" Australia Zoo crocodile research team leader Toby Millyard said. The wild world of crocodile farming Warren Entsch said one of the more unusual encounters he had while crocodile farming was during a flight over Queensland in the 1980s. He was forced by the pilot to travel in the cargo bay alongside a bigger-than-expected haul of crocodiles. Three were tied up and covered with hessian bags because Mr Entsch miscalculated the number of transportation cages. He told the BBC he was given a loaded handgun and warned not to shoot the fuel tank if the crocodiles escaped their makeshift restraints. The animals became ill due to altitude sickness, leading them to vomit and defecate throughout the plane. \"They went ballistic,\" Mr Entsch recalled. Crocodile farmer John Lever, from Koorana in Queensland, has been on multiple trips to gather eggs from crocodile nests. The 63-year-old said he had some close calls with crocodiles, but \"it's a bit like having a near miss in your car, you go off and forget about it.\" \"You learn to manage behaviour about the nest, but when a big male challenges you at night and you're on a little boat on the river in the dark that can be pretty intimidating when they're 5m (16ft) and three quarters of a tonne (750kg),\" Mr Lever said. The estuarine crocodile is protected as a vulnerable species under current Queensland legislation, a point of conjecture on both sides of the debate. The state government says it will only back the egg harvesting plan if it does not threaten the animal's survival in the wild. Mr Millyard said accurate surveys of crocodile populations had not been conducted for a decade and needed to be completed before a decision was made. \"Anything people say about crocodile numbers is really hearsay and opinion,\" he said. The final report into a trial live egg collection trial in Cape York - the largest and most intact tropical savanna left on Earth - is expected to be released by the Queensland Government in the coming weeks. Robbie Morris, environmental manager of Pormpuraaw Aboriginal Shire Council in Cape York, said the study has shown there would be no impact on populations if a limited harvest of wild eggs are taken from nests that would already be washed away by flooding. \"Wild eggs could be taken and hatchlings reared without influencing the population,\" he told the Cairns Post. \"If we do actually get the go ahead to do a wild egg harvest there would be scope for three or four permanent positions at the farm for local indigenous people.\" The Australian Conservation Foundation's Andrew Picone said a range of issues needed to be considered before allowing egg harvesting in Cape York. \"At face value it presents some problems [but] if there's not any economic opportunities on the Cape [York] things like mining and other extractive industries will continue to be seen as the only option, and undermine tourism,\" Mr Picone told the BBC. He agreed that expanding the farming industry in Queensland could also provide culturally appropriate opportunities for remote indigenous communities. Meanwhile, the Northern Territory recently increased the number of eggs that can be harvested each year by 40 to 90,000 viable eggs. Its Wildlife Trade Management Plan also allows for the take of 1,000 live crocodiles. The government aims to double its crocodile products industry to A50m (35m; PS24m) in four years.",
        "Two bugging scandals, a very bitter row over drivers' penalty points and his failure to complete a breathalyser test at a police checkpoint have kept him in the headlines. But they are just some of the disputes he was involved in. The minister came to power with the Fine GaelLabour coalition in February 2011, four months after the Republic of Ireland was forced to accept a humiliating international financial bail-out. Mr Shatter, a lawyer, was put in charge of two government departments - justice and defence. As the Republic of Ireland introduced painful austerity measures, the new justice minister set out on a wide-ranging reform agenda, which included plans to close more than 100 police stations. But, in May 2013, the justice minister became embroiled in a public row that generated so much attention it became popularly known as Shattergate. The minister was taking part in a TV debate about alleged police corruption in the penalty points system, following claims officers inappropriately wiped points from the driving licences of often well-connected offenders. His opponent in the debate was the independent parliamentarian Mick Wallace who had made claims that sports stars, journalists and others appeared to have their driving penalties waived. Mr Shatter accused his opponent of hypocrisy. He informed viewers that Mr Wallace had himself benefited from police discretion on a penalty points offence, having been observed using his mobile phone at a set of traffic lights in Dublin. There was no formal reprimand or police record of the event, so Mr Wallace wanted to know how the minister could have known about it. Mr Shatter said his information source was the then police chief, Martin Callinan, resulting in more questions over the minister's close working relationship with the country's top police officer - not for the first nor last time. Within days, the justice minister faced questions in parliament about claims he had once failed to provide an alcohol breath test at a police road checkpoint in Dublin. In a written statement, Mr Shatter replied that he failed to complete the breathalyser test because of his asthmatic condition and was waved on by officers. He denied he had taken alcohol before getting into his car and said he was returning home from the Irish parliament. Under Irish law, elected members going about parliamentary business cannot be arrested. However, Mr Shatter was then accused of abusing parliamentary privilege in refusing to submit to the breath test. The country's main opposition party, Fianna Fail, tabled a motion of no confidence in the justice minister, but it was defeated on 29 May 2013. In December 2013, Mr Shatter issued an unreserved apology on behalf of the state after a major public inquiry found that Irish police officers had colluded in the IRA murders of two senior Northern Ireland policemen in 1989. The Smithwick Tribunal investigated allegations of collusion by the country's police force, An Garda Siochana, in the killings of Royal Ulster Constabulary officers, Supt Bob Buchanan and Ch Supt Harry Breen. The RUC officers were shot dead by the IRA as they returned from a meeting at Dundalk Garda station. The tribunal, and indeed the murders, had preceded Mr Shatter's tenure as justice minister by many years, but he was still caught up in controversy. In June 2011, tribunal chairman Judge Peter Smithwick accused the minister of trying to interfere with the independence of the public inquiry. The judge, opposition politicians and unionist representatives at Stormont objected to Mr Shatter's attempt to impose deadlines on the only Troubles-related public inquiry to take place in the Republic of Ireland. The justice minister has also had a tense relationship with the Garda Representative Association (GRA), which represents rank and file police officers. In 2013, the GRA passed a motion of no confidence in Mr Shatter and refused to invite him to address its annual conference. It was the first time in the GRA's history that the organisation snubbed an Irish justice minister in such a way. Over recent months, Mr Shatter has been heavily criticised for his handling of claims that the office of the Irish police watchdog may have been bugged. A security sweep of the Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission's (GSOC) offices suggested evidence of electronic surveillance in a meeting room and a compromised wi-fi system. The sweep was carried out last year, but details emerged months later in a Sunday Times newspaper report. It also emerged that GSOC had not informed either the police or the justice minister about the findings of the security operation. Mr Shatter publicly criticised the ombudsman for not informing him, but the opposition accused the minister of treating GSOC as the villain, not the victim, of the bugging controversy. Meanwhile, the actions of two police whistleblowers, who made allegations that there was widespread abuse of the penalty points system, were described as \"disgusting\" by Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan. When an independent report largely vindicated the whistleblowers, there were calls for the police chief to retract his \"disgusting\" remarks. Mr Callinan refused to back down and weathered the criticism for three months. But on 25 March, he resigned unexpectedly. Within hours, the timing of his resignation became clear as a new controversy engulfed both the police and the department of justice. The government announced it was setting up an inquiry into revelations that telephone calls to and from many police stations had been secretly recorded, without the knowledge of either officers or callers. It later emerged there were about 2,500 secret tapes still in existence, some dating from as far back as the 1980s. Witnesses in criminal investigations are among those whose conversations were secretly recorded and the revelations could have major implications for current and completed court cases. Opposition politicians repeated their calls for Mr Shatter to step down, but on 2 April, a second motion of no confidence was defeated in parliament by 95 votes to 51. This week, the penalty points row and the Garda whistleblowers controversy came back to bite the minister. On Tuesday, Data Protection Commissioner Billy Hawkes ruled that Mr Shatter had broken data protection laws during his TV spat with Mick Wallace. The commissioner ruled the minister should not have disclosed personal information about Mr Wallace, namely telling viewers that the independent TD had been cautioned by police for using his mobile phone while driving. But it was Mr Shatter's handling of the whistleblowers' case that finally caused his downfall. On Wednesday, Taoiseach Enda Kenny told a stunned parliament that Mr Shatter had resigned following the government's receipt of a report into allegations made by Sgt Maurice McCabe. Mr Kenny said his colleague had taken responsibility after the report criticised a number of agencies, including the police, the Department of Justice and the minister himself. However, the man who has been dubbed the \"minister for self-defence\" did not leave without a parting shot. In his resignation letter, Mr Shatter said he disputed some aspects of the report. He added that he \"would have expected\" the author Sean Guerin SC to interview him before reaching a conclusion. The whistleblowers' report is due to be published on Friday.",
        "He's been refused somewhere to stay because he comes from Ebola hotspot, Sierra Leone. Amara arrived in Norwich from West Africa a fortnight ago and was turned down by two landlords - one by letter. Both were happy for him to stay until he handed over his passport and they realised he was from a country at the centre of the current epidemic. He told Newsbeat that he was \"devastated to be turned down.\" The letter said: \"Under normal circumstance. Your profile would be a great profile to be one of our lodgers. \"However, given that the world is about to probably experience an Ebola epidemic, we have decided not to accept anyone that has been anywhere near the ebola outbreak within the last two months, or is likely to visit those areas in the near future.\" Amara, 35, told Newsbeat that it is wrong to assume all people from Sierra Leone carry the disease. He says: \"It's very unreasonable. And if you think everybody coming from Sierra Leone is affected, then that's just completely unfair.\" The good news for Amara is that after a few weeks of looking, he's found somewhere to stay so he can continue his studies. More than 4,400 people have died in the Ebola outbreak, mainly in West Africa. Britain has now begun screening passengers at Heathrow airport. People arriving from the worst-affected countries will be questioned and may have their temperatures taken. Professor Tom Solomon is an expert on diseases like Ebola and how they spread. How worried should we be here in the UK? I think we should be worried about Ebola in West Africa because sadly the cases have gone up and up but the situation in the UK is very different from the situation in West Africa. Was the landlord right to be so cautious? I understand why people are concerned about Ebola but what people need to do is look at the facts and then make sensible decisions. You're not going to get Ebola from renting your flat to someone from Sierra Leone. How do people get Ebola? Ebola is passed on if someone is in contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is actually sick with the disease. So clearly letting out your property wont put people at risk. Is the virus going to become airborne? There is no evidence that the virus is airborne and we have never seen the virus change and become airborne - so there is no evidence to say that this will happen here.

        "His is one of dozens of cases opened by authorities in a crackdown on condoning or threatening terrorism. Justice Minister Christiane Taubira said words of hatred and contempt had to be fought with the \"utmost vigour.\" Dieudonne already has convictions for inciting anti-Semitism and the courts banned several one-man shows last year. A judicial source quoted by AFP news agency said he was due to be released on Wednesday evening but would face trial at a later date. The justice ministry said earlier that 54 cases had been opened since the murders of 17 people in Paris last week. Of those, 37 cases involved condoning terrorism and 12 were for threatening to carry out terrorist acts. Some fast-track custodial sentences have already been handed down under anti-terror legislation passed last November The justice minister said prosecutors should act firmly and quickly against anyone found condoning terrorism or carrying out racist or anti-Semitic acts. Dieudonne is already facing an inquiry into whether he condoned terrorism in a video in which he mocked the decapitation of US journalist James Foley by Islamic State militants. If found guilty, he could face up to seven years in jail and a a'!5,000 (PS3,800; 5,900) fine. Hours after 3.7 million people took part in rallies across France on Sunday, with the biggest in the centre of Paris, Dieudonne said on his Facebook page that the \"historic\" march had been as magical as the Big Bang that had created the universe. \"I'm finally going home,\" he wrote. \"Know that this evening, as far as I'm concerned, I'm feeling like Charlie Coulibaly [French: je me sens Charlie Coulibaly].\" He combined the \"Je suis Charlie\" I am Charlie slogan adopted across the world in support of the 17 victims of the Paris attacks with the name of one of the three Paris gunmen, before deleting the remark a short time later. Coulibaly killed a policewoman near a Jewish school last Thursday before going on to hold up a kosher supermarket the following day when he murdered four Jewish hostages. Dieudonne's comment drew an angry response on Monday, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls saying that freedom of speech should not be confused with anti-Semitism, racism and Holocaust denial. After Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said he had asked the authorities to investigate Dieudonne's remarks, the comedian posted a response on his Facebook page, arguing that he was being treated as public enemy number one when all he wanted to do was make people laugh. \"I'm being seen as an Amedy Coulibaly when I'm no different from Charlie,\" he said. The murders at Charlie Hebdo by the Kouachi brothers were widely seen as an assault on freedom of speech, on a magazine that has frequently launched withering attacks on religion, with depictions of the Prophet Muhammad. The publication of a new issue of Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday was so sought-after that the publishers increased the print run to 5m copies. Dieudonne's detention immediately drew claims of double standards from some quarters in France. But French daily Le Monde pointed out (in French) that French law limited freedom of speech and it did not extend to incitement to hatred or racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia. In 2007, the then editor of Charlie Hebdo, Philippe Val, was cleared of inciting hatred against Muslims for reprinting cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Dieudonne was himself acquitted last year over comments made in a video in which he called for the release of a man who tortured and murdered Ilan Halimi, a Jewish man, in Paris in 2006. His trademark \"quenelle\" gesture has been criticised as an inverted Nazi salute although he argues it was intended to be anti-establishment.",
        "Phenytoin sodium capsules, used by 50,000 people in Britain, are made by Pfizer and sold by Flynn. Pfizer said it was co-operating with the Competition and Markets Authority. When Pfizer made the drug under its Epanutin brand name, the NHS spent about PS2.3m on the drug, the CMA said. This amount soared to PS50m in 2013. The CMA said Pfizer sold UK distribution rights to Flynn in 2012, but continued to make and supply the drug to the company. Analysis: Hugh Pym, health editor This is a provisional report, with allegations made by the Competition and Markets Authority. The companies now have a chance to give formal responses and a final ruling may not be made until next year. But it comes at a time of intense debate about NHS finances, as patient demand and the cost of treatment rise faster than budget increases. NHS England is grappling with the need for ambitious efficiency savings. It has been under fire for reducing the number of treatments available to patients through the Cancer Drugs Fund. So today's provisional findings, with renewed scrutiny of drug spending, are the last thing the pharmaceutical industry needs. It was after this deal that prices rose, said the watchdog in a provisional finding. \"The CMA's findings on dominance and abuse are provisional and no conclusion can be drawn at this stage that there has, in fact, been any breach of competition law. We will carefully consider any representations from Pfizer and Flynn Pharma before deciding whether the law has been infringed.,\" said Ann Pope, CMA senior director of anti-trust enforcement. Companies can be fined as much as 10 of annual sales for abusing a dominant position in a market, depending on the seriousness of the abuse. Pfizer and Flynn can now supply their own views and evidence before the watchdog makes a decision, it said. \"Ensuring a sustainable supply of our products to UK patients is of paramount importance to Pfizer and was at the heart of our decision to divest the product,\" said Pfizer in a statement. \"Pfizer is co-operating fully with the CMA's ongoing investigation.\" A message left with Flynn Pharma was not immediately returned.",
        "One of the most shocking aspects of the government's decision to spend PS9m on a campaign to promote Britain's EU membership - judging by social media reaction - is that it is based around leafleting. Leaflets seem like a staggeringly inefficient and low rent way of getting a message out in today's networked world. Even a 16-page glossy brochure, of the kind produced by the government, has a very \"old school\" feel about it. Most of them will probably go straight in the bin, along with take-away flyers and credit card offers, say critics. But David Cameron must feel that enough people will take a look at what the government has got to say to make it worth their while. He has insisted the PS9m campaign is \"money well spent\" - a little premature perhaps, given that we don't know the outcome of the referendum yet. In fact, both sides in the debate will be entitled to a free mailshot once the official campaign period gets under way. What is causing so much controversy is that the government would not have been allowed to spend PS9m on leaflets during the campaign, due to spending rules. So why is everyone so desperate to pepper the country with unread pamphlets? About a third of the PS9m will be spent on an online and social media campaign - but printed material is still where it is at, says Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. \"Political parties would not spend millions of pounds each election putting this stuff out if it didn't work. \"It's still the main mechanism by which voters hear from political organisations. It dwarfs every other form of contact.\" A face-to-face chat on the doorstep was still the most effective method of converting voters to your cause, he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One, but that was time-consuming, so mailing out leaflets was a \"cheap\" and \"relatively easy\" alternative. Social media, he added, came a \"poor third\" as a tool of persuasion. Leaflets reach the silent majority of people who are not glued to their smart phones day and night, particularly older people who tend to vote in large numbers and could swing the referendum in a close contest. Another major advantage of mailshots over social media is that your claims are not immediately shot down and ridiculed by your opponents. The government's EU brochure leaflet is available online, where the world can pick it apart. But when you retrieve it from your doorstep, and take a glance at its contents on the short journey to the kitchen bin, your letterbox will not start spewing out spoof versions of it and angry rebuttals. Many of which will be more interesting than the original and a lot funnier. Unlike on social media. The government has attempted to justify its campaign by saying people are hungry for facts about the EU referendum. We know from our own inbox at the BBC how true this is. The problem is that there are very few facts. Just about everything in the EU referendum debate is contestable, as soon as one side produces a \"fact,\" the other side challenges it with a contradictory \"fact.\" That is because much of it is based on hypothetical scenarios. What would happen if the UK left the EU, what would happen if it remained? No wonder people say they are confused. The leaflet is a way for the government to cut through that. Leave campaigners are also sending out leaflets setting out the \"facts\" about Britain and the EU, although theirs will not be funded by the taxpayer. The other justification ministers have used for their campaign is that there is a precedent for it. Harold Wilson's Labour government also sent out a leaflet to every household setting out the case for staying in the \"common market,\" as the EU was then known. The arguments made in Wilson's document, ahead of the 1975 EU referendum, have a very familiar ring to them. But one crucial difference is that Mr Wilson himself is right there in the leaflet, making his personal recommendation to the country. David Cameron is more than happy to do that when he is facing an audience at a QA session. But his face is nowhere to be seen in the government brochure.",
        "One person died overnight after being hit by a freight train at the Channel Tunnel's Coquelles terminal, according to Eurotunnel. On Thursday a migrant, believed to be Syrian, died after being hit by a car on a motorway close to the tunnel. Their deaths bring to 16 the number of people killed in or near the tunnel trying to get to the UK since June. Emergency services have not yet been able to identify the latest victim's age or sex because of the severity of their injuries. Eurotunnel said: \"Once again it is a very regrettable accident but it shows yet again the serious risks that are involved in trying to cross the Channel illegally. \"The driver of the train has now been taken into the psychological support system that Eurotunnel operates for this kind of incident and the police will be looking after all other aspects.\" Eurotunnel said services from Folkestone were being delayed by about two hours. The situation in Calais is part of a wider migrant crisis across Europe, with huge numbers of people heading north from the Mediterranean. Several men have faced charges in recent months after allegedly walking the 31-mile (50.5km) length of the Channel Tunnel from Calais to the UK. New security measures were introduced at the tunnel's entrance in August to cut the number intrusion attempts, which reached 2,000 per night at their peak.",

He normally travels surrounded by a cohort of bodyguards - which might slightly impede any voluntary work he undertakes. He and his media companies also employ a small army of lawyers. Notwithstanding his final conviction by Italy's highest criminal court, the former prime minister still maintains that he is the innocent victim of politically biased judges. Nonetheless, he still faces a possible ban on holding public office, and later this month will almost certainly be stripped of his seat in the Senate. He was due to begin serving his sentence this week, but bureaucratic delays in the Italian judiciary are legendary. It now appears that no decision will be made by the authorities for at least six months as to how he is to pay off his debt to society. The media mogul can propose what organisation he would like to join, but there is no guarantee that he will be assigned to the charity or the soup kitchen of his choice. The Italian media has had a field day reporting serious, and less-than-serious, offers. A street circus in Naples offered him a chance to go on stage and tell his own jokes. Mr Berlusconi loves to entertain his friends in private with songs, and with jokes that are sometimes notoriously off-colour. He began life as a crooner on board a cruise ship and he has written lyrics for his own songs composed and recorded by his close friend Mariano Apicella, a Neapolitan entertainer. A human rights group suggested that Mr Berlusconi could help them lobby international organisations for the abolition of the death penalty in countries where criminals are still executed. A city in the north offered Mr Berlusconi a desk and an office to counsel business owners suffering from the economic recession. Gino Strada, founder of Emergency, an Italian humanitarian organisation that provides medical services in war zones, including Afghanistan and Sudan, said Mr Berlusconi would be welcome to offer his services to them - although he added that perhaps they would keep him away from their accounts department. Meanwhile, a new way out for Mr Berlusconi has appeared on the horizon. President Giorgio Napolitano is urging the government to pass a new amnesty law aimed at reducing the severe overcrowding in Italy's prisons, and Mr Berlusconi's supporters are hoping that the measure might stretch to cover commuted sentences such as that given to the former prime minister. For now, it is unclear whether the proposed amnesty could cover Mr Berlusconi's community service, and it may be several months before the bill is decided on. Reform minister Gaetano Quagliarello, who belongs to Mr Berlusconi's Freedom Party, says it would be \"unthinkable\" to exclude him from a measure that applies to all Italian citizens. Justice Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri, on the other hand, said last week she did not think Mr Berlusconi could benefit from the measure.",
        "Satellite images taken on 14 February appear to show two batteries of eight missile launchers and a radar system on Woody or Yongxing Island in the Paracels. The presence of missiles would significantly increase tensions in the acrimonious South China Sea dispute. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said reports were a Western media invention. But Mr Wang defended \"the limited and necessary self-defence facilities\" on islands inhabited by Chinese personnel as \"consistent with the right for self-preservation and self-protection..... under the international law.\" Asked about the reports, US Secretary of State John Kerry attacked China's increased \"militarisation\" of the contested region, saying it was a \"serious concern.\" Taiwan's defence ministry said it had \"learned of an air defence missile system deployed\" by the Chinese on Woody Island. It would not say how many missiles had been deployed or when, but told the BBC they would be capable of targeting civilian and military aircraft. The commander of the US Pacific Fleet confirmed the deployment to Reuters news agency. Adm Harry Harris said such a move would be \"a militarisation of the South China Sea in ways\" China's President Xi Jinping had pledged not to make. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said there were \"serious concerns\" over China's \"unilateral move to change the status quo\" in the region, and \"we cannot accept this fact.\" China has been carrying out extensive land reclamation work in the region, which it says is legal and for civilian purposes. But the work has angered other countries which also claim the territory, and there is growing concern about the implications of the area becoming militarised. The latest images of Woody Island were captured by ImageSat International. They show a close-up of a section of beach, the shape of which resembles the northern coastline as it appears on other images, and point out two missiles batteries. Each battery is made up of four launchers and two control vehicles. Two of the the launchers appear to have been erected, says the report. An image taken of the site on 3 February shows the beach empty. Fox News quoted a US defence official as saying the missiles appeared to be the HQ-9 air defence system, with a range of about 200km (125 miles). China's deployment of long-range surface-to-air missiles to the South China Sea is a clear escalation, but it is not a surprise. Nor is it China's first deployment of advanced military technology to Woody Island (Yongxing Dao). Last November, photos appeared on the internet of Chinese J-11 fighter jets landing on the newly-enlarged runway there. Sending the missile batteries now could be a warning to Vietnam, or a response to the US Navy, which sailed a missile destroyer past Woody Island at the end of January. So far Beijing has been careful not to put any weapons on its newly-constructed islands further south, in the Spratly group. That would be much more provocative. Last month Beijing even sent two civilian airliners to land on its newly-completed runway at Fiery Cross Reef. It was a good publicity stunt. But no one should be in any doubt that the true purpose of those new islands and their new runways is also military. The news comes as South East Asian regional leaders end a two-day meeting in California where South China Sea had been a topic of debate. US President Barack Obama said the members had discussed the need for \"tangible steps\" to reduce tensions, including \"a halt to further reclamation, new construction and militarization of disputed areas.\" Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years. Its islets and waters are claimed in part or in whole by Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. China has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols, while the US says it opposes restrictions on freedom of navigation and unlawful sovereignty claims - by all sides, but seen by many as aimed at China. The frictions have sparked concern that the area is becoming a flashpoint with global consequences. Although largely uninhabited, the Paracels and the Spratlys may have reserves of natural resources around them. There has been little detailed exploration of the area, so estimates are largely extrapolated from the mineral wealth of neighbouring areas. The sea is also a major shipping route and home to fishing grounds that supply the livelihoods of people across the region.",
        "The system can involve withdrawal of medication, food and fluids. It can offer a peaceful and dignified death but there have been problems with its implementation, the government-commissioned review is set to say. Health officials said the review was expected to recommend the LCP should be phased out within six to 12 months. The system was developed at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the city's Marie Curie hospice in the 1990s to provide a model of best practice in the care of dying patients. It can mean an end to invasive tests, treatment or feeding through tubes that is deemed to cause unnecessary suffering at the end of life - but it should be discussed with the patient, family or carer where possible. The pathway was developed during the late 1990s at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, in conjunction with the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute. It was intended to provide uniform, high-quality, dignified care for dying patients - whether they were in hospital, at home, in a care home or in a hospice. Previously, there were concerns that care had been patchy, with some hospitals failing to meet acceptable standards, and accusations that people were subjected to invasive treatment and testing that offered no chance of preventing death, but merely prolonged their suffering. Under the LCP, patients are regularly reviewed to ascertain whether medication should be stopped - and whether fluids should be withdrawn once they have ceased to be able to eat and drink. However, families have complained relatives were put on the pathway without their consent, and that death has been hastened in people who were not dying imminently. Critics say that it is impossible for doctors to predict when death is imminent, so the decision to put a patient on the pathway is at worst self-fulfilling. There have also been suggestions that the pathway has been used to help hospitals save money. NHS Trusts do receive payouts for hitting targets related to its use - but the suggestion that the pathway has been used for cynical reasons has been vigorously denied by the Department of Health. The Department of Health (DoH) in England set up an independent review amid fears the LCP was being used to hasten death, to clear beds and save money, and that patients or their families were not being consulted. The review, led by crossbench peer Baroness Julia Neuberger, applies only to England. The LCP is also used in Scotland and Northern Ireland but not in Wales, which has its own framework for end-of-life care and support. A Scottish Government spokeswoman told the BBC it welcomed the Neuberger review. \"Recommendations set out in the report will be considered by the Living and Dying Well National Advisory Group, so that any learning for Scotland can be taken forward with stakeholders,\" the spokeswoman said. The review for England was asked to focus on the use of the LCP model rather than re-evaluating its basic merits. But the DoH said the review team, which heard evidence from patients, families and health professionals, encountered \"numerous examples of poor implementation and worrying standards in care.\" The review was likely to conclude the LCP needed to be replaced, it said in a statement. \"The independent review into end of life care system the Liverpool Care Pathway, commissioned last year by Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb and backed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is likely to recommend that the LCP is phased out over the next six to 12 months,\" the DoH said. The statement gave no indication of what might replace the LCP. But Mr Lamb said: \"We need a new system of better end-of-life care tailored to the needs of individual patients and involving their families.\" He ordered the review in November last year amid intense media scrutiny of the LCP following criticism from patients' families. At the time, he said he was concerned about the \"unacceptable\" cases that had come to light. British Medical Association president elect Baroness Finlay said the LCP was originally brought in because patients were \"dying badly, in hospitals in particular.\" They were being \"walked past, ignored and neglected,\" she said, and the LCP was an attempt to \"roll out the best of hospice care into other areas.\" \"By and large that worked well but the problem has been that it hasn't always been used properly,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. She said that if the LCP was phased out it was vital something better replaced it. \"Something which is very clear, very simple and which drives up professional behaviour,\" Baroness Finlay added. Dr Linda Patterson, clinical vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians - which has been reviewing the LCP every year since it was introduced in 2004 - said the system was \"very helpful.\" \"But if the execution of it in all instances has not been right then we need to review that,\" she added. \"All doctors dealing with patients who may unfortunately die need to be trained in end-of-life care. We need to know what the standards are, we need to be able to apply them, our junior doctors and trainees need to be fully trained in it. And we also need time - time to be able to discuss these very difficult issues.\" Jason Suckley, director of policy and campaigns at Sue Ryder, said the healthcare charity's research had shown the timing and quality of conversations health professionals had with terminally-ill patients amounted to a \"lottery.\" He said workers' communication skills needed to be improved and urged Health Education England, which provides training and support for healthcare professionals, to include end-of-life training in its workforce mandate. \"When it comes to dying we cannot afford to get it wrong and health professionals need to be supported to communicate with people effectively at a very traumatic and emotionally difficult time,\" he said. The review's findings are due to be published in full on Monday.",
        "The President argued that even if the accord was fully implemented it would only have a \"tiny, tiny\" impact. But researchers have told BBC News that the President was \"cherry picking in the extreme\" in his use of the facts. They say that the Paris deal could make the difference between tolerable and dangerous levels of warming. While much of his statement on withdrawal was concerned with the negative economic impact of being part of the Paris agreement, the President also mentioned the negligible impact that the deal would have on temperatures. \"It is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree ... Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100,\" he said during his lengthy explanation. \"Tiny, tiny amount.\" Climate researchers have immediately taken issue with the President's use of the data. \"This is cherry picking in the extreme,\" said Prof Niklas Hohne, who works with the Climate Action Tracker to monitor likely emissions levels. \"He picked the study that has the least impact of the Paris agreement on the global temperature increase.\" The study on which this assertion was based was carried out by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014 and published in 2015. Crucially the study didn't include all the commitments made by countries in the run up to the meeting in the French capital at the end of 2015 that agreed the wide-reaching Paris deal. Another major question is that the study presumed that none of the actions proposed would continue past 2030. \"Their study assumes that countries implement their Paris pledges by 2030 but then move back to high emissions,\" said Prof Hohne. \"We think that is unrealistic because if the countries implement Paris they will likely continue with similar policies.\" A subsequent investigation in 2016 by the same group at MIT suggests that up to one degree of warming could be averted if all the promises made in the Paris agreement were honoured. The authors believe that withdrawing from Paris is the wrong approach. Their findings on how much difference Paris will make are echoed by the Climate Action Tracker researchers who found that 0.8 of a degree of warming could be avoided if countries stuck to their pledges. This difference could help prevent dangerous levels of warming for the whole planet. \"It is a considerable impact, and it is the first time since 2009 we see a considerable downward trend in temperatures because countries have made proposals for what they are going to do,\" said Prof Hohne. \"This, for me, is a really strong point of the Paris agreement.\" How strongly the US pullout will impact future global temperatures is currently being assessed by scientists, including those at the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). \"This is an additional 0.3 degrees on the warming, due to the withdrawal of the US,\" Deon Terblanche, the head of the WMO's Atmospheric Research and Environment Department, told a meeting in Geneva, stressing that this was an estimate and not a modelled result. \"That's a worst case scenario, and this is probably not what will happen.\" Prof Niklas Hohne agrees that the full impact of the US pullout could be less than feared. \"President Trump wants to stop the Clean Power Plan, but it is very likely that some of the states will go even further and be more aggressive and we also hear there is pushback from many major companies that they want to go towards more renewables. \"In essence progressive states and companies could compensate for Trump.\" Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook",

        "A High Court judge in Belfast had ruled that the PSNI should not have facilitated illegal parades, and was wrong to think it did not have legal powers to stop them. The ruling was quashed after an appeal. The UK Supreme Court has now been asked to overturn the decision. There were widespread loyalist protests across Northern Ireland after Belfast City Council decided not to fly the Union flag at the City Hall every day of the year in December 2012. The protests included a weekly parade between east Belfast and City Hall, which passed the nationalist Short Strand area. Critics accused the police of being too soft as some of the protests descended into violence. The PSNI insisted it did not have the legal powers to stop them, and warned that doing so might have made the situation worse. In April 2014, a judge in the High Court in Belfast upheld a claim by a Short Strand resident, who cannot be named to protect his safety, that the PSNI had failed in its legal duty to stop the parades. The judge said the police had not understood the full scope of their powers and had facilitated illegal and sometimes violent parades, in breach of their legal duties. That ruling was appealed by then Chief Constable Matt Baggott, and quashed by the Court of Appeal. The legal battle moved to the UK Supreme Court in London on Tuesday. A lawyer representing the unnamed resident, told five judges the PSNI had failed in its duty to enforce the law as set out in the Public Processions Northern Ireland Act (1998). She argued that the Court of Appeal had no grounds to interfere and overturn the original trial decision as \"the evidence before the court was unimpeachable.\" The lawyer said there were \"evident flaws\" in the Court of Appeal decision and its analysis of the evidence. Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, asked her: \"So you say that we should go back to the trial judge and, provided we concluded that there was evidence on which he could fairly reach the decision that he did, that we should reinstate his decision?\" She replied: \"Yes.\" But a lawyer representing the PSNI said the Court of Appeal had made the correct decision. He said the context of the time the protests had taken place was important. He told the court the police had been dealing with a series of sporadic unplanned protests at more than 80 locations across Northern Ireland. He insisted there had been \"no error of law\" and that the police fully understood that they could have stopped the parades, but took an operational decision not to so. He said the police believed that \"robust action\" could have made the situation worse and took a deliberate decision to secure evidence of offences committed and to prosecute offenders afterwards. The lawyer referred to research by Queen's University, which recorded that 306 people had been convicted of flag-protest-related offences across Northern Ireland in the months after the protests. \"Many would have considered the police approach to policing these parades was successful, and that their policy of de-escalation succeeded,\" he said. The judges said they would announce their decision \"in due course.\"",
        "The charity said there had been a total of 137 convictions in the same period. The maximum sentence for offenders is six months in prison andor an unlimited fine, but campaigners want it to be raised to up to three years. Brian Wheelhouse, who runs a dog rescue centre, said offenders only cared about financial gain and not about the dog. Eduardo Goncalves, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \"Evidence from the UK and abroad points to the activity being a'gateway' crime to serious and organised offences, such as drug and gun crime. \"In the United States dog fighting is recognised as a Grade A felony by the FBI.\" France applies a sentence of up to two years, and Germany and the Czech Republic apply a sentence of up to three years. The RSPCA said the highest number of calls it had received had been in Greater London (924), followed by the West Midlands (469), West Yorkshire (305) and Greater Manchester (238). Rural counties are also affected, including the areas of Kent, Essex and Lancashire. Get the data for your area here The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said there were \"strict laws in place\" to deal with people who were not properly looking after animals. A spokesman said: \"Anyone who is cruel to an animal or does not provide for its welfare needs may be banned from owning animals, given an unlimited fine or sent to prison.\" Campaigners including the League Against Cruel Sports, the RSPCA and the Dogs Trust, along with the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) have all called for tougher sentencing as a deterrent. Deputy Chief Constable Gareth Pritchard, the NPCC's lead for dangerous dogs, said \"this kind of animal abuse\" caused \"untold distress and harm to the animals involved.\" We had a call from the dog compound. There was concern because this dog had obviously been used for dog fighting, or as dog bait, with the injuries it had sustained. A dog that attacks another dog will go for the jugular vein - for the neck - so Benji has got injuries all around his neck, [and] around his face. Dog fighting is done by individuals that are fighting them for financial gain. They're not bothered what happens to the dog at the end of the day as long as it wins. They're not bothered about the injuries because they're not going to be taking it to the vets and having it treated. They'll leave it to heal up by itself. If the dog dies then so be it. To inflict injuries and do horrible things on these poor creatures just beggar's belief. Last year, two kittens were found in Bradford with their fur coloured using marker pens. It is thought they were to have been used as bait in a dog fight, where people would have bet on which one would have died first. They came in through a police officer who'd been to a property and seized them. We'd never seen anything quite like it before - one was coloured blue with a marker pen, and one was green. Thankfully nothing terrible had happened before they came to us. We believe that they may have been coloured in to be used for dog fighting. It was horrendous and we were thinking those cats were probably minutes away from being ripped to shreds by dogs, and they were tiny. We're aware of other incidents where cats have been used as bait for dog fighting.",
        "Accident and emergency waiting times for patients have lagged behind other parts of the UK. Two years ago, a major hospital in Belfast, Royal Victoria, was said to be \"at breaking point,\" as a backlog of patients built up and a major incident was declared. But, even with the latest provisional figures showing a decline in AE performance, there is a determination among clinicians and nursing staff to draw a line and build a level of service to be proud of. There is evidence of a change of mood with the opening in August of an emergency department at Royal Victoria, part of a new PS150m critical care facility. Doctors, bruised by the turmoil in the 2013-14 winter, have developed new ways of working, designed to speed the flow of patients through the system. It's early days, but there are some encouraging signs - in recent months, there has been a 10 year-on-year increase in the number of patients treated or assessed within four hours. The most recent data for November, though, shows an increase of five percentage points year-on-year. The hospital points out it has dramatically reduced the number waiting 12 hours or more. A key policy at the Royal Victoria is putting senior clinicians close to the \"front door\" of the emergency department. Their task is to quickly triage patients and send them through different treatment streams. Special report page: For the latest news, analysis and video Analysis: The lost beds problem Winter across the UK: A guide to how the NHS is coping Video: Why hospitals are under so much pressure Video: How a hospital can grind to a halt The idea is to avoid a build-up of people waiting in reception. Badly injured or sick patients are dispatched through the system in the normal way, but a more sophisticated approach has been developed for those who are less seriously ill. A critical-assessment unit next to the emergency department receives patients, with the aim of dealing with their medical needs within the day. This could involve an initial appraisal and then sending a patient home for the night with an appointment booked the next day. Known as a \"virtual ward,\" the idea is to carry out treatment without patients needing overnight stays, so reducing pressure on bed occupancy. Specialist equipment is made available to this unit, allowing doctors to order scans and other procedures to accelerate the patient's progress. Royal Victoria and other emergency departments are facing deep-rooted pressures. Northern Ireland does not have a 111 or NHS Direct helpline to guide patients, where appropriate, away from AE towards other forms of treatment closer to home. And there are only a few minor injuries clinics to take the pressure off the major hospitals. The Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board has announced measures to boost GP out-of-hours services and promote alternatives to turning up at AE. The NHS has to cope with long-standing health problems in some areas, including mental health, which can be linked to economic decline and deprivation. The integration of health and social care offers Northern Ireland the opportunity to tackle major problems common to all parts of the United Kingdom. Problems caring for the elderly at home and in their local communities have left most UK hospitals struggling to discharge patients and free up beds for new patients to occupy. Southern Health and Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland is pioneering consultant-led care of the elderly in the community, offering, in effect, hospital care in a patient's own home. The service aims to treat at home patients with a wider range of acute illnesses. In its first year, the pilot service has prevented about 440 hospital admissions. With 1.8 million people, it will always be a challenge for Northern Ireland to sustain a full range of NHS services and specialist care. There is clearly a will to rise to that challenge, but no-one is denying the task may get harder with rising attendances at hospitals, an ageing population and complex health needs.",
        "While ministers claim their Psychoactive Substances Bill reflects the findings of the experts, I am told that the hand-picked committee was divided on whether low-harm substances like amyl nitrate (poppers) and nitrous oxide (laughing gas) should be included. The final report was drafted by Home Office officials but some members of the panel, which included three people who also sit on the ACMD, insisted on writing in what became known as the \"safety-valve\" clause. The recommendation for \"general prohibition\" was amended to say that there should be exemptions for substances \"where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed.\" The line was included specifically to ensure that some low risk products could be excluded from the ban. The coalition government response last October went along with the safety-valve clause saying it would \"explore how to put in place a schedule of exemptions and make provision to add to these where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed.\" But when the new Conservative government published the Psychoactive Substances Bill last month, any mention of assessing social harms or health risks had gone. The safety-valve clause insisted upon by the expert panel had been removed. The Home Office has made it clear that \"there is no provision in the Bill to enable the licensing of so-called low-harm substances\" arguing that there are difficulties in defining low risk and that it might \"send out confusing messages about the safety of new psychoactive substances.\" It is likely that this is going to be a major battleground as the controversial bill reaches committee stage in Parliament. The LibDem Home Affairs spokesman Lord Paddick has made it clear his party will oppose the legislation in its current form. \"As drafted, the Bill is far too broad and indiscriminate, further undermining credibility and efficacy in reducing harm,\" he told the House of Lords. The Bill would ban any substance that affects a consumer's \"mental functioning or emotional state,\" unless specifically exempted by the Home Secretary. This definition goes further than the Irish legislation on which the approach is modelled. In Ireland, a psychoactive substance is defined as one that results in \"a significant disturbance in, or significant change to, motor function, thinking, behaviour, perception, awareness or mood.\" The word \"significant\" is, of course, significant. It provides the safety valve that excludes low-risk and low-harm products. Whether UK ministers will relent on this issue of a \"safety-valve clause\" is perhaps the biggest question as the Psychoactive Substances Bill makes its progress through Parliament.",
        "Tumours in the ovaries are hard to detect in the earliest stages meaning it can be too late to treat them effectively by the time they are found. A trial of 4,051 women, reported in the journal Cancer, showed the method could identify those needing treatment. But a huge study taking place in the UK will give a final verdict on the test when it is completed in 2015. There is a survival rate of up to 90 when ovarian cancer is caught early, compared with less than 30 if it is discovered in the later stages. Unlike other cancers, the symptoms, such as pelvic and abdominal pain or persistent bloating, are often put down to other common ailments and the tumour can be missed. There is no mass screening programme to detect the cancer either. Scientists already know that levels of a protein in the blood, called CA125, are often higher with ovarian cancer. However, it is too unreliable on its own. It misses some patients and tells others they have the cancer when they are actually healthy. Researchers are now testing the idea of using the blood test to sort patients in risk groups based on levels of CA125. Instead of going straight for surgery, low-risk patients are tested again in a year, medium-risk ones after three months and high-risk patients have an ultrasound scan to hunt for tumours. The US study, at the University of Texas, followed post-menopausal women for 11 years on average. Ten women had surgery based on their ultrasound scan and all the cancers detected were at an early stage. Researcher Dr Karen Lu told the BBC: \"Clinical practice definitely should not change from our study, but it gives us an insight - we didn't get a lot of false positives.\" She said the UK study of 50,000 people would give definitive results: \"There are two big questions - do we see cancers at an earlier stage and do we decrease the number of deaths.\" Dr Sarah Blagden, from the Ovarian Cancer Action research centre, said: \"Relative to the trial under way in the in the UK, this is a small study, but it does show that effective ovarian screening is possible. \"In 2015 the results of the UKCTOCs study will become available and the results are eagerly anticipated, more so now that this American study has produced such encouraging results.\" Annwen Jones, the chief executive at Target Ovarian Cancer, said: \"The results of this study are without doubt very positive, and we should take hope from that. \"Early detection of ovarian cancer will be the key to transforming survival rates. However, this study is very small, and there is no guarantee that the results will be replicated on a larger scale.\"",
        "Chevrolet has developed a mode called Teen Driver, which can keep young drivers safe on the road. The feature, available in the new 2016 Chevy Malibu, does things like mute the radio if the driver's not wearing a seat belt. A key fob can also be used to set a speed limit between 40 and 75mph. If they go over that, visual and audible warnings will be triggered to tell the driver to slow down. The feature also allows parents to see a report of the total distance driven, maximum speed travelled, how many speed warnings were issued or if there were any driver road skids. Parents can also make sure traction controls stay set and lights are not left on during the day. Chevy and other car manufacturers already offer a valet mode on cars, which limits how the car is driven and uses an onboard camera and data recorders to prevent abuse. The new system has been criticised for not doing anything to stop drivers from using devices like mobile phones. The 2016 Chevy Malibu will be unveiled at the New York car show next month.

Wright told BBC Scotland that \"if what's alleged\" to have occurred did in fact happen \"we'll come down severely hard on both.\" Referee Don Robertson sent off both players during the break. Wright, whose side confirmed their top six place due to results elsewhere, says he did not see the incident as he had already started walking up the tunnel following the half time whistle. BBC Scotland reporter Jonathan Sutherland saw Foster throw a punch at Swanson, who retaliated by aiming a kick at the defender after he had slipped. \"I haven't seen it with my own eyes but obviously something happened,\" said Wright. \"I'm going to wait and see for myself. The players have been told they let themselves down, and let the team down. We should be celebrating confirming our top six place tonight. \"Under no circumstance will they get off lightly if what is alleged to have happened has happened.

Wednesday's talks in Brussels ran more than 90 minutes over schedule. \"Many allies disagree when Russia tries to portray [the Ukraine conflict] as a civil war,\" Mr Stoltenberg told a new conference. \"This is Russia destabilising eastern Ukraine, providing support for the separatists, munitions, funding, equipment and also command and control.\" He added: \"Nato and Russia have profound and persistent differences. Today's meeting did not change that.\" Mr Stoltenberg said it was important to keep channels of communication open \"to discuss our differences and to reduce the risk of military incidents.\" He also said that the two sides had agreed on the importance of implementing the Minsk peace agreement, which has produced a fragile truce in eastern Ukraine. Russia's envoy to Nato, Alexander Grushko, said a US guided-missile destroyer had sailed near the Russian port of Kaliningrad last week in an attempt \"to exercise military pressure on Russia.\" \"We will take all necessary measures, precautions to compensate these attempts to use military force,\" he said. In last week's incident, two Russian warplanes flew close to the US destroyer almost a dozen times in international waters in the Baltic Sea. US officials described it as \"an aggressive act.\" The Nato-Russia Council was established in 2002. Although meetings at ambassadorial level have not taken place since June 2014, there has been other political dialogue. Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of covertly backing the rebels who now control much of eastern Ukraine. Russia strongly denies the claims. Nato has since moved to bolster its forces in its east European member states to counter what it says is a Russian military build-up. Russia has described Nato's increasing presence in eastern Europe as a threat to its national security.",
        "The shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed. Archaeologist David Jacques, said: \"They.... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall.\" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a \"modern bungalow.\" \"They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,\" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with \"exotic\" stones from outside the area. \"There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,\" explained Mr Jacques. \"It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them.\" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. \"It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,\" he said. \"It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. \"This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like.\" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: \"I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. \"It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.\"",
        "She had come prepared to own up to her mistakes, apologising to the gathered throng just as a few hours earlier she had apologised to the cabinet. It had been her decision to call the election, and her leadership of the campaign that faltered and in what was described as the most human performance they had seen for quite some time, Theresa May said sorry, time and again. \"We saw the human being, not the Maybot\"; \"it was the first time in seven weeks she didn't say strong and stable\"; more poignantly for the Tories MPs who commiserated with each other, \"if she'd campaigned like that, we'd have won.\" They were cheered, relieved perhaps, that she had, tonight, managed to pull it off, to show regret at the calamity her decision to go to the country had unleashed, relieved too that she rose to this particular occasion that seems likely to settle nerves enough to avoid the possibility of the party plunging into another leadership election and potentially therefore, another general election that they might lose. The sense of immediate danger to her leadership has faded. But while her enemies are not breathing down her neck, they are still in the room. One MP told me she wasn't asked any hard questions but deliberately took the time to take all of them, to show willing, \"her strategy has been to take as many questions as exist.\" It's like that episode of the West Wing where the Presidential Candidate Vinick was in deep trouble, so he took endless questions until the press finally got tired and went home - apologies if the American series isn't your thing, but it's an obsession of rather a lot of Westminster types. While publicly it is tonight the done thing for Tories to be fulsomely on the record praising the prime minister, privately it's hard to find a single MP who believes that she will take the party into the next general election. PM survives first bout of battle for control It is, however, also very hard to find a single MP who wants to unleash even more potential chaos by triggering an election contest, let alone a general election. But it's the circumstances, rather than newly discovered rapture, for the PM that have saved her. One former cabinet minister told me \"having a Tory prime minister is much more important than our own wound licking.\" Another minister told me in the medium term it is \"hard to see how\" the PM can stay. Theresa May has survived the first bout of what will be a fight to stay in control. The election has redressed the balance, not just between the two main parties, but also between the Tory leader and her party. And the PM knows it, most tellingly also saying to her MPs tonight, \"I'll serve as long as you want me.\" Hardly a bold statement of a leader who feels they are in charge, but an acknowledgement that others will decide when their time is up.",
        "Researchers at the University of Sheffield said the tumours were effectively \"fertilising\" the bone to help themselves grow. The study, in the journal Nature, said it may be possible to protect bone from a tumour's nefarious influence and consequently stop the cancer's spread. Cancer charities said this opened up \"a whole new avenue for research.\" Around 85 of breast cancers that spread around the body end up in bone, at which point the cancer is difficult to treat and more deadly. The scientists, in Sheffield and the University of Copenhagen, discovered patients with secondary cancers had higher levels of an enzyme called LOX being produced by their tumours and released into the blood. Bone is constantly being broken down and rebuilt. But in a series of experiments on mice, the research team showed LOX was disrupting the process and leaving lesions and holes in the bone. Using drugs to block LOX prevented the cancer from spreading. Dr Alison Gartland, a reader in bone and cancer biology at the university, told the BBC News website: \"We think it's a significant breakthrough in trying to prevent metastases (secondary tumours) in breast cancer. \"The cancer cells in the primary tumour are actually fertilising the soil for the future growth of itself, LOX is changing the environment in bone to make it better to grow.\" The animal tests also showed that a set of osteoporosis drugs called bisphosphonates could prevent the spread of cancer. Bisphosphonates also interfere with the way bone is recycled in order to strengthen it. They are already given to some cancer patients, but the Sheffield team believe they could have a much larger role. The effect was discovered only in oestrogen-negative breast cancers. They account for around a third of cases, but are far more deadly. Katherine Woods, from Breast Cancer Campaign and Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: \"By unveiling the role that the protein LOX is playing, these results open up a whole new avenue for research and treatments that could stop breast cancer spreading to the bone. \"The research also adds weight to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of bisphosphonates in stopping secondary breast cancer in its tracks. \"The reality of living with secondary breast cancer in the bone is a stark one, which leaves many women with bone pain and fractures that need extensive surgery just when they need to be making the most of the time they have left with friends and family.\" The findings may also apply in colon cancer.",
        "A senior executive at the Wall Street giant, Daniel Pinto, said that \"hundreds\" of staff may move to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg. However, it is understood that the number of people who would be relocated involves between 500 and 1,000 jobs. Earlier, Standard Chartered bank said it was in talks with German regulators about making Frankfurt its Europe base. However, Standard said the impact on UK staff would be \"minimal.\" Several global banks have announced in recent weeks that they will move some jobs out of London as part of contingency plans for when the UK leaves the EU. Speaking to Bloomberg News, Mr Pinto, head of investment banking at JP Morgan, said: \"We are going to use the three banks we already have in Europe as the anchors for our operations. \"We will have to move hundreds of people in the short term to be ready for day one, when negotiations finish, and then we will look at the longer-term numbers.\" JP Morgan's main offices in continental Europe are in Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg, but it also has operations in Paris, Milan, Madrid and Stockholm. JP Morgan is widely reported to be in talks to buy a Dublin office big enough to hold more than 1,000 workers. Since the Brexit referendum last year, European cities have lined up to try and woo financial services companies to move operations there to continue serving European clients. Standard Chartered chairman Jose Vinals said on Wednesday: \"We are looking at setting up a subsidiary in the EU to ensure we are prepared. \"The choice of Frankfurt is very natural as we have a branch there and we do euro clearing there.\" However, a spokeswoman for the bank, which only has a small amount of business in Europe, said the impact on UK staff would be \"minimal.\" Other financial services companies have announced plans to move workers out of London in case the UK fails to secure \"passporting\" rights for them to operate across EU borders after Brexit. Deutsche Bank said last week it could move up to 4,000 jobs out of the UK as a result of Brexit - nearly half its UK workforce. Barclays told the BBC the bank was preparing to add hundreds of staff to offices in Dublin, Frankfurt and Milan to counter Brexit risks to its European business. Goldman Sachs has confirmed it will move jobs away from London and bulk up its European presence by \"hundreds of people\" before a Brexit deal is struck. Insurers Lloyd's of London and Royal London are also setting up subsidiaries outside the UK. JP Morgan's Mr Pinto told Bloomberg: \"We have to plan for a scenario where there is no UK-EU passporting deal, and we have to move a substantial portion of our business to continue serving our European clients. \"We'll have to wait to see what kind of deal can be achieved and see what we need to do from there.\" He was speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Saudi Arabia. A JP Morgan spokesman confirmed Mr Pinto's remarks, but did not elaborate on the story. A report commissioned by the City UK industry group warned in October that as many as 75,000 financial services jobs could be lost from London if operations into the EU are severely disrupted after Brexit.",

Monarch's flights to Sharm el-Sheikh are still suspended and it does not expect them to resume before next year. The comments came as Monarch returned to profit for the year to 31 October. Mr Swaffield told BBC Radio 5 Live that customers were \"booking closer to departure\" in the wake of the attacks. He said: \"They're booking in pretty big numbers and there's no lack of interest, but they're not booking quite so far out because they're waiting to see what the world has in store. \"That will probably last a little while and then things will get back to normal again.\" Luton-based Monarch expects annual profits to exceed PS40m after cost cuts helped to achieve a turnaround.

        "New head coach Paul Clement had confirmed club legend and former caretaker boss Curtis would no longer be involved with the first team. Curtis, 62, played more than 350 games for the Swans, has been caretaker manager three times and has also served the club as first-team coach. The new role will see him monitor players from the first team and Under-23s on loan at other clubs. Curtis will also assist the likes of scout Brian Flynn in the identification and recruitment of young players. The Premier League has made the loan player manager's role a requirement for all clubs. \"I'm delighted to take up the new role,\" said Curtis. \"It was an opportunity I jumped at following very amicable discussions. It's a very important role and one that excites me.\" Former Derby County boss Clement was appointed on Tuesday following the departure of Bob Bradley last week. Curtis was in charge for the 2-1 win at Crystal Palace, the day Clement's arrival was confirmed. Ex-Wales international Curtis has held a number of coaching roles with Swansea, and was appointed first-team coach by Michael Laudrup - a role he subsequently kept under Garry Monk, Francesco Guidolin and Bradley. The former Leeds and Southampton forward has previously been assistant manager, youth team manager and Football in the Community officer at Swansea. As a player he scored 32 goals during the club's promotion season in 1977-78 and was part of the team managed by John Toshack that won promotion to the old First Division in 1981. \"While Alan has stepped away from a direct first-team coaching role, we felt it was imperative we kept him as part of our footballing structure and have his presence around the club and training ground,\" said Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins. \"Not only does he have a wealth of knowledge and experience, he is respected throughout the game, not just in Swansea.\" Swansea have had as many as 12 players out on loan at one time this season.

They had both attended the 40th anniversary rally of the Modrapheniacs Scooter Club near Wareham in Dorset. The pair, who were both members of the Cyder Commando Scooter Club, were heading back to their caravan on 5 March and stopped off to relieve themselves.

        "The 48-year-old took had been in charge of Posh since replacing Dave Robertson in September and lifted the club as high as the play-off places in January. But they have since fallen to 14th in the table and have lost four of their last five matches. Assistant Grant McCann will take charge for the final two games of the season. Westley was asked by BBC Radio Cambridgeshire if he felt increased pressure following Saturday's defeat and said: \"I come to work every day and feel pressure, I put pressure on myself. \"I don't like losing football matches, but I know the job here. The job is to build long-term winning. \"Right now the job is to get our young players on the pitch, to give them a chance to succeed and to grow, and that's what we've done (against Scunthorpe). \"There'll be lessons learned by all of the players, and if we're going to be a successful club next year, then we need the young players to step up to the plate and the experience now will be useful for them.\" The former Stevenage and Preston boss began his career at the ABAX Stadium with 10 wins from his first 14 matches in all competitions. However, after losing to West Brom in a FA Cup fourth-round replay on penalties and the January sale of forward Conor Washington, still the club's top scorer this season with 15, Posh lost six of their next seven league matches. After a brief run of three straight victories, the club's form dipped again, leading chairman Darragh MacAnthony to say \"I employ over 300 people at Peterborough United, not one of those employees right now has a job in the summer.\" Earlier this week, Westley also bemoaned his side's poor discipline - the worst record in the Football League with 104 yellow cards and seven reds - saying it was costing them games. A brief statement on the Peterborough website read: \"The club would like to thank Graham for his efforts on behalf of the football club. \"Chairman Darragh MacAnthony will take time to speak to prospective candidates for the vacant manager position.\"",
        "The Rolling Stones apparently charge 8m (PS5m) to do a one-off performance, while Sir Elton John is said to require 4m. Kylie Minogue - who once sang at the wedding of the daughter of Indian steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal - is reported to be a more affordable 2m. So for those of us without superwealth, arranging such a gig seems impossible. However, help may now be at hand thanks to three music fans and their London-based company Songkick. A concert notification website and app for your mobile phone and tablet, Songkick this year launched a new service called Detour. Essentially a form of crowdfunding, fans who wish to bring a certain band to their hometown or city can start a petition or \"pledge\" via Songkick. You enter your credit card details on Songkick's website or app, and how much you would be prepared to pay. If a sufficiently large number of people also pledge, then Songkick informs the band in question and its promoters. \"We have launched the service in London, targeting smaller bands and venues,\" says Songkick's co-founder and chief executive Ian Hogarth. \"But we plan to extend it across the UK and globally, and ultimately to the largest venues and artists. \"Obviously there is no guarantee that the band or singer in question will ultimately agree to play in a certain town, but so far more than 90 have indeed done so to - performing live is after all how bands make the majority of their money these days.\" But if you and your friends are indeed successful in bringing to Rolling Stones to your town, how much do you pay via Songkick? Ian says: \"You ultimately pay the ticket price as set by the band. So if you have pledged more, you don't pay the difference. And if you have pledged less than the ticket price, we contact you to say you'll need to pay more. \"And of course you can pull out of paying if ultimately you don't want to, or can't make the concert for some reason.\" So if that is how Songkick's Detour service helps music fans, how does it benefit the bands or solo artists? Put simply, Songkick passes on vital information to bands about how many people would like to see them play live in a certain place - and the prices they are prepared to pay for tickets. From this data bands can work out which towns and cities to go to, the correct size for a venue, the optimum number of concerts to play and how much to charge. And Songkick gets a cut of the ticket price. With an average of 50 of all concert tickets currently going unsold in countries such as the UK and US, Songkick claims the information it provides is the holy grail for the live music industry. Ian says: \"It is about bringing 21st Century technology to the live music industry.\" Based in the Hoxton area of east London, the other, and currently larger, part of Songkick's business is a notification system that means music fans can avoid missing out on seeing their favourite band or singer perform live. Free to use for the consumer, it sends you an alert when a band or singer you like is about to release tickets for a tour due to visit a city or town near you. You can then buy the tickets via Songkick, which takes a commission of up to 10 from the promoter. Songkick's technology means that the user doesn't have to enter a list of bands and singers that he or she likes, as instead it automatically checks your digital music collection, and what you listen to on streaming services such as Spotify. Ian and his two co-founders started the company when he was just 25. Now six years later, it is a global operation used by eight million people per month. For Ian, a Londoner who studied engineering and software at Cambridge University, it was working in California's Silicon Valley that made him realise you are never too young to launch a new technology company. \"Living in the Valley for a year was a really influential experience,\" he says. \"The head of data at Facebook at the time was my age. It helped me realise that you could just go for it and start a business if you were interested in solving a particular problem. \"The actual idea came from my co-founder Michelle You, we are both really big gig-goers, and she said,'Is there a way to use technology to make it easier to know when a band you like is going on tour?' \"I had the tech background to say'yes it can be done', and Songkick came from there.\" Ian says he \"always wanted to build something.\" \"It didn't have to be a company, an invention would have done. I'm always most excited when making something.\" But after graduating, Ian's love of music and China initially saw him spend a year in Beijing, learning Mandarin and earning money as a DJ playing hip-hop. It was also in Beijing that he first met Californian Michelle You, who was a fellow pupil at the same language class. They both kept in touch when they left China, with Ian working in Silicon Valley for management consultants Bain Company, and Michelle in New York. After Michelle questioned how technology could be used to better used to find out about forthcoming concerts, the idea for Songkick was born. Quitting their day jobs together with third co-founder Pete Smith, a friend of Ian's since Cambridge, they set up the company, initially using their own money. Ian says that while he and his colleagues could have based Songkick in California, they chose London because: \"It is the gig capital of the world. London has more concerts than anywhere else.\" He says the company is proud to be doing its bit to help the wider music industry. \"The music industry has been through a huge amount of change in recent years. Not helped by illegal downloads, sales have fallen sharply. \"So now bands make 70 of their income from touring. But at the same time, on average, half of all concert tickets go unsold. Songkick is helping sell those spare tickets.\" Now backed by venture capital funding, including 10m (PS6.4m) last year from Sequoia Capital, the Silicon Valley firm that has previously funded the likes of Google, Apple and PayPal, Songkick still has just 30 members of staff. \"We are a small team, but the important thing is the talent density - our staff are extremely talented,\" says Ian. And while he says he finds it difficult not to spend all his time thinking about the company, he is happy to delegate. \"I see my job as attracting exceptional people to solve problems, and then getting out of the way to let them do it.\" Ian now intends to grow Songkick's business tenfold over the next five years, and is relaxed about the possibility of the established ticket agencies doing something similar to both its core business and new Detour operation. He says: \"Our biggest competitors are the ones you don't know about - the three people in a bedroom coming at it from a completely different angle.\"",
        "Wellington Zoo said Lanky had arthritis and had been struggling to support his own weight. He had stopped eating or taking his medicine. He was euthanised \"in his best interests,\" the zoo said in a statement on Monday. An Australian pelican, Lanky was the longest living resident of Wellington Zoo, arriving there in 1978. \"Lanky had regular medical examinations and we were able to manage the arthritis in his ankles with pain relief and anti-inflammatories, but his lameness increased over recent months,\" said the zoo. His recent refusal to eat was in contrast to his appetite in better days, when he consumed a kilo of fish a day, sometimes \"sneaking food off his neighbours\" in his favourite haunt of Monkey Island, said Senior Keeper Phil Wisker. Pelicans from Australia do occasionally drop into New Zealand but Lanky was the only one permanently in the country. He originally arrived in Wellington from Australia's Adelaide Zoo, after being rescued with three other wild pelicans from a local drought, the zoo said. \"All of us here at the Zoo are sad to see Lanky go, as he has been a real character and much loved by everyone who has cared for him over the last decades,\" it said.",
        "Previously, agents with the FBI and other federal agencies were forbidden from recording interrogations without special dispensation. Critics of the old policy said it risked generating false confessions and other abuses. The change was first reported by the Arizona Republic newspaper. The policy, due to take effect in July, will cover agents at the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the US Marshals service. Under the new rules, agents may take audio or video recordings but the latter will be \"strongly encouraged,\" the justice department memo authored by Deputy Attorney General James Cole states. Valerie Newman, a lawyer and law professor who served on a Michigan task force on the issue, told the BBC the policy shift brings the US federal government in line with the states, whose police are already required to record interrogations. \"Now you have transparency, so it's not one person's word against another's,\" she said. Under the current policy, federal agents conducting an interview take handwritten notes and then produce a report summarising the conversation. Critics have charged that process unfairly works against a defendant in court, especially when the suspect's recollection of the interview differs from that of the agent. \"You'll often hear a criminal defendant say,'I never said that.' But how can you prove that?\" Ms Newman said. Former US Attorney for Arizona Paul Charlton said he was fired in a 2006 purge at the justice department in part because he pushed back against the policy of not recording interrogations. \"We were losing cases and pleaded cases to a lower offence when we ought have won those cases,\" because of the policy, he said. Mr Charlton had jurisdiction over violent crimes normally considered in state criminal courts, because of 21 Indian reservations in his district. He said the lack of recorded confessions did \"great harm\" to his prosecutions, especially in child sex abuse cases. \"It was a grossly outdated policy,\" he said. While the justice department has refused to release its policy on recording of suspect interviews, the New York Times has published a 2006 FBI document stating that jurors might not understand the legally permissible tactics agents use to obtain information - and could find them distasteful. The bureau has also said recording devices might intimidate suspects into silence. Exceptions to the new policy include when the interviewee refuses to be recorded, national security or public safety situations, or when it is not feasible. The policy shift will not apply to interviews conducted outside the US, though the memo notes recording \"may be appropriate\" in that circumstance.",
        "Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) figures show medics spent 32,000 hours waiting at AE departments in 2015-16 compared with 16,000 in 2014-15. YAS said waiting time \"was one of the most significant issues\" it faced. A shortage of available hospital beds has been given as one of the problems causing knock-on delays at AE. Dr David Macklin, Executive Director of Operations at YAS, said handover waiting times were \"a system problem\" for the NHS, not just in Yorkshire, and said blame could not be attached to individual hospitals. \"We have numerous occasions where we have multiple vehicles queued at hospitals,\" he said. \"Emergency departments across Yorkshire are working incredibly hard to manage their demand and that means sometimes ambulances are queuing. \"Patients who are not seriously injured may need to wait.\" Professor Keith Willett from NHS England said the increase in waiting times was \"concerning\" and added there were \"a multitude of reasons\" for the rise. \"One of the biggest problems is the pressure on the beds in the hospital,\" he said. \"That's because the hospitals are finding it increasingly difficult to move patients and their care back into the community.\" The figures were supplied after a Freedom of Information request by the BBC. Just five hospitals - one each in East, South and West Yorkshire and two in North Yorkshire - accounted for about 70 of the total waiting time. The handover time is counted only after 15 minutes have elapsed at AE. The number of hours spent by the YAS to handover patients was about 12,000 In 2013-14 and about 16,000 in 2014-15.

The service faces a projected 1bn Canadian dollar (943m; PS576m) loss by 2020 without \"fundamental changes.\" Canada Post lost C73m in the third quarter of the current fiscal year, CBC News reported. \"Canadians expect Canada Post to continue to remain financially self-sufficient and not look to their hard-earned tax dollars for funding,\" the postal service said. At the same time, \"the rise in digital communications has dramatically changed the postal needs of Canadians.\" Direct to the home delivery will be replaced by community post boxes installed throughout residential areas, Canada Post said in its plan. The agency said two-thirds of Canadians, mostly in newer suburban neighbourhoods and rural areas, already receive their mail through this method. The cost of postage stamps purchased in bulk will rise to 0.85 per stamp, up from 0.63 today, among other price rises. In all, the plan will return the agency to financial sustainability by 2019, Canada Post said in a report, citing annual savings of up to C900m. Between 6,000 and 8,000 jobs will be eliminated as part of the plan - 12 of Canada Post's employees, although it says its workforce is ageing and it expects almost 15,000 workers will retire or leave the company in the next five years. Canada Post delivers close to 10 billion letters and parcels each year but has seen a 24 drop in letters delivered since 2008.",
        "Westley lasted five months and became County's second boss sacked this term. The Exiles have confirmed Mike Flynn as caretaker boss until the summer. \"We engaged and consulted a number of folk, including some of the players and given the overwhelming view of fans coupled with the players' feedback, it was obvious the environment needed a change,\" Foxall told BBC Wales Sport. \"We hope Michael is able to put the passion that was not there against Leyton Orient on Saturday back into the club,\" he continued. \"You don't get stability by changing the manager regularly. \"But looking at the run of results and more so the Leyton Orient game, the manner of the defeat, we as a board tried to consider all factors. \"The players have smiles on their faces and I do think there has been an uplift in their mood.\" Foxall says he understands criticism of the board for allowing Westley to sign 13 players in January only to sack him six weeks later, but says they felt they had to back him until Newport were 11 points adrift at the bottom of League Two and in danger of relegation. \"We had a view as a board that everything Graham had he inherited and we said we would support him in changing the squad,\" he said. \"Hindsight is a great thing, but we felt we've always made the right decision for the club at that time. \"We have always had the view we would support the manager 100. \"We still believe it was the right thing to give him the window we did, even though it has not worked out how we all would have wanted.\" Foxall says the hope is that Flynn, a former player and local man, will be able to galvanise the County supporters. \"Michael is a local boy, born and bred and loves the club,\" he said. \"We are hoping as a board that his appointment will rally the fans, they have not had much to shout about this season. \"I've noticed Michael has matured greatly over the time I've been involved with the club. \"Michael was an obvious choice.\" Foxall said the club would have to make some \"difficult' and'challenging\" decisions if they lose their Football League status, but insisted the club have \"the right infrastructure in place to challenge next season.\"",
        "Jose Mourinho's side had applied incessant pressure on the Foxes from kick-off, and Romelu Lukaku missed a second-half penalty prior to the goals, as they found it difficult to break the steadfast backline. I think we frustrated them for large parts of the game They finally breached the last line of defence when Rashford converted Henrikh Mkhitaryan's corner three minutes after coming on. And then midfielder Fellaini stuck out his knee to divert fellow substitute Jesse Lingard's drive past Kasper Schmeichel. United are the only side to have won all three of their opening league games this season and have yet to concede a goal. United peppered the opposition area with crosses in the first half, but aside from a Paul Pogba strike that drifted narrowly wide, the threat from the wings was comfortably dealt with by the Foxes' defensive giants Wes Morgan and Harry Maguire. There was a shift in manager Mourinho's thinking in the second half as his side began to breach the 18-yard area with shorter balls from a more central position. That probing should have resulted in the opening goal. Leicester were once again on the back foot in their area before Anthony Martial struck a shot that came off Danny Simpson's arm. Referee Michael Oliver declared it to be deliberate handball. ...plus reaction video here Lukaku stepped up to the spot, but his hopes of a fourth league goal this season were thwarted by Schmeichel's dive to the right. Leicester continued to come under pressure and eventually succumbed when Rashford's instinctive shot flew past the Dane in goal in the 70th minute. Holes now began to appear in Leicester's previously watertight defence as they went looking for an equaliser. United capitalised again as substitute Lingard's low drive was diverted into the net by Fellaini, although replays suggested the Belgian was fractionally offside. Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare should not be too despondent. His side's valiant defensive display was reminiscent of those during the Premier League-winning campaign two seasons ago. It was at the other end that his men disappointed. At Old Trafford, both Jamie Vardy - the Foxes' star striker of 2015-16 - and Shinji Okazaki were ineffective, while Riyad Mahrez teased the United defence without an end product. Vardy was withdrawn with 15 minutes left, to be replaced by Islam Slimani. The closest Leicester came to scoring was when substitute Andy King forced a brilliant point-blank save from David de Gea in the final few seconds of the match.

Last season we won against Leicester at home so that doesn't make a difference, but we had too many draws at home last season. \"The difference is the quality of our football, we're playing better today. If we hadn't won this match I wouldn't have anyone to blame. The team is playing very well and I'm very confident. We are comfortable on the ball and dangerous on the counter-attack.

Greek governments have been accused of not fully investigating the list, which was given to Athens in 2010 by the then French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde.

        "Supermarket Morrisons cut the price of diesel by up to 2p per litre, and Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's followed the move with their own price cuts. The last time diesel was cheaper than petrol was 2001, according to analysis by Experian Catalyst. Morrisons said lower wholesale diesel costs meant it could pass on savings. Mark Todd, petrol director for Morrisons, said: \"This is a milestone in motoring and many younger drivers won't remember the last time that diesel prices were lower than unleaded.\" Pump prices are influenced by factors including the distance from oil terminals and refineries, so not all diesel prices will be lower than petrol, the supermarkets said. In July 2001, diesel cost 77.92 pence per litre on average, compared with 77.94 pence for a litre of petrol, according to Experian Catalyst data. A month prior, diesel had been as much as a penny cheaper per litre, and a price difference of just under two pence was found in 2000. There may be some delay until UK motorists see the price dip among all competitors. Experian Catalyst said the on Sunday UK average prices narrowed to 117.10 pence per litre for petrol and 118.33 pence for diesel. Diesel is normally more expensive than petrol per litre for a variety of reasons, according to the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association. While most recent investment in refineries UK has been for unleaded petrol production, more efficient engines mean petrol demand has been decreasing since the early 1990s, depressing prices by comparison to diesel, it says. However, increased supply of diesel from refineries outside the UK is likely to be the reason behind this recent price flip, according to the RAC. \"With the price of crude oil standing at 56.50 and the pound relatively strong against the US dollar - the fuel trading currency - there is scope for further price cuts of up to 4p per litre off diesel over the next fortnight, and unleaded may even benefit from a slight reduction too due to the continued oversupply of oil,\" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. \"Drivers of unleaded petrol vehicles should not feel short changed - what we are seeing is the diesel pump price coming down to a level closer to what it should be due to the effects of greater refining capacity in the Middle East.\" Wholesale prices for diesel have been cheaper than petrol since 27 May, the RAC said. As crude oil has become cheaper, both petrol and diesel prices have fallen too. However, petrol prices have fallen more slowly allowing diesel to become cheaper, says James Challinor, research director for research and consultancy group Wood Mackenzie. This is caused in part by demand for petrol from the US. \"Fundamentally it is strong demand for European gasoline [petrol] from the US and West Africa that is supporting the wholesale\" petrol price, he said. Refinery outages in Latin America are creating demand for exports of US petrol into that region, which in turn leads European petrol to be exported to the US, he added.",

        "The interim report into Integrated Care 24 (IC24), which runs non-emergency 111 and out-of-hours services in Norfolk and Wisbech, found deficiencies in call handling and a shortage of GPs. During unannounced inspections following complaints, staff said they had been asked to alter their records. IC24 said it had addressed the issues. The organisation operates NHS 111 services in areas including Great Yarmouth and Waveney and parts of Essex, and took over the Norfolk and Wisbech contract in September 2015. Assessors from Norwich Clinical Commissioning Group (NCCG) inspected five IC24 bases in Norfolk and one in Cambridgeshire in November following staff complaints. Their report highlighted issues including: In October last year, IC24's interim chief executive said the organisation was still struggling to fill shifts. A month later, Norwich resident Peter Rowley said he called 111 but waited 11 hours for a call back, eventually going to AE instead. Read more on this and other stories from Norfolk The company apologised, but said it had followed procedures. Karen Watts, who wrote the interim report into IC24, concluded it was \"not clinically assured of the safety of the OOH [out-of-hours] service\" and only \"partially assured\" of the 111 service. She said the CCG believed the issues identified were having a \"negative impact on recruitment and retention of the existing workforce.\" Ms Watts also demanded IC24 provide a detailed improvement action plan by the beginning of December. The BBC asked to see the improvement plan, and whether concerns highlighted in the report had been sufficiently addressed, but both NCCG and IC24 declined to answer, instead sending a joint statement. NCCG spokesman Tim Curtis said the organisation had been \"very encouraged with IC24's response.\" Yvonne Taylor, IC24 chief executive, said: \"As an open organisation, I would like to reassure our patients that we continue to work with our commissioners to provide a robust and transparent service for our patients.\" Both organisations said: \"There were no deaths that we know of which can be attributable to the long waits.\" The NCCG has been asked to share the outcomes of its investigation so they could be examined by a health committee, a Norfolk County Council spokeswoman said. Tony Durcan from the Royal College of Nursing said it had \"sought reassurances that measures had been put in place to address the worrying points raised by the leaked report.\" Dr Tim Morton, chairman of Norfolk and Waveney Local Medical Committee, said IC24's problems were \"a consequence of a severe workforce crisis within the NHS in recruiting and retaining GPs.\" NHS 111Out-of-hours care",
        "NHS Direct initially won 11 of the 46 regional contracts for the service, covering 34 of the population. It has already pulled out of two services, but now says the remaining nine are \"financially unsustainable.\" The whole 111 service has been plagued with problems. NHS bosses have said there is no room for complacency. The service is run by different organisations in each area, including private companies, ambulance trusts and NHS Direct - which ran the old telephone advice line. Discussions are already taking place with other providers, particularly the ambulance trusts, to see who could take over from NHS Direct. NHS Direct announced in June that it was pulling out of two areas - Cornwall and North Essex - even before the services were launched. And earlier this month, it warned that the volume of calls at two of its larger contracts, North West and West Midlands, were 30-40 lower than contracted leading to lower income and leaving its whole 111 service \"financially unsustainable.\" NHS Direct used to be paid more than PS20 per call when it ran the old 0845 number. The payment is between PS7 and PS9 per call for the new 111 service. Projections reported earlier this month showed NHS Direct had lost PS2.8m since April and was \"heading for a deficit of PS26m if we continue to run the same volume of 111 services until the end of this financial year.\" The organisation is now seeking a \"managed transfer\" of its 111 contracts, which have between two and five years left to run, to another provider. NHS Direct has already pulled out of contracts for 111 services in Cornwall and North Essex Nick Chapman, the chief executive of NHS Direct, said: \"We will continue to provide a safe and reliable NHS 111 service to our patients until alternative arrangements can be made by commissioners. \"Whatever the outcome of the discussions on the future, patients will remain the central focus of our efforts, together with protecting our staff who work on NHS 111 to ensure that the service will continue to benefit from their skills and experience.\" The health minister Lord Howe accused NHS Direct of \"losing control of the ball\" and said the majority of the country was getting a good service. \"Their problem, I'm afraid, is that they got their sums wrong, which is very disappointing,\" he added. The whole 111 service was meant to be up and running in April. However, many areas were not ready and only half of services were operational by May. Some parts of England will not have an operational 111 service until 2014. There have also been problems with reports of callers not being able to get through and calls being inappropriately referred, leading to an extra strain on ambulances and hospitals. Dame Barbara Hakin, the deputy chief executive of NHS England, told the BBC: \"We've been in discussions with other providers, particularly the ambulance trusts who, with their experience, will be able to, in a properly managed fashion, take over this service from NHS Direct. \"I'm not going to pretend for one minute that we haven't had very significant problems with 111, which we need to deal with, but it's a really great service with potential.\" Meanwhile, a Channel 4 undercover investigation at another 111 provider, Harmoni, has reported staff shortages, long waits for callers and some cases of ambulances being called out unnecessarily. The Dispatches programme, which will air on Monday night, reports one call centre manager saying the service was \"unsafe\" at weekends because there were too few staff to deal with the calls coming in. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said the government was not shying away from problems with 111 and it was \"confident that it will continue to push up standards for patients across the country.\" It has been an embarrassing start for the 111 phone line. MPs labelled the April launch \"premature,\" some services will start around a year late and doctors describe 111 as an \"abject disaster.\" There have been reports of long waits and question marks around the decisions made by telephone operators. The Prime Minister and NHS England admit there have been problems introducing the service. However, NHS 111 is here to stay. The immediate challenge will be to find someone to take over the nine regional contracts run by NHS Direct. Ambulance trusts look the most likely to run those services. NHS bosses say callers should not notice any difference in care while the transition is made. QA: NHS 111 Shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, said it was a \"mess of the government's making\" which had led to nurses being replaced by computers. \"The government urgently has to step in both in the short term, to ensure the continuity of the service, but secondly, to get more clinicians back in the front line handling calls -because this computer approach just I'm afraid isn't working, and won't relieve pressure on ambulance services and AEs.\" Dr Chaand Nagpaul, from the British Medical Association, said 111 had been an \"abject failure.\" \"The decision by NHS Direct to seek a withdrawal from its contracts to provide NHS 111 reveals worrying flaws not just with the tendering process for NHS 111 contracts, but for how contracts are awarded and monitored throughout the NHS.\" He said if the service was to recover it needed to be properly funded and closely integrated with local NHS services. Dr Nagpaul added: \"The government must review its competitive tendering approach and instead look towards an integrated model based on cooperation between local services.\"",

        "Philip Hammond says the extra money - to be phased in over three years - will help support a system that is \"clearly under pressure.\" It comes after months of warnings that services provided by councils for the elderly are under threat because of a lack of funding. The numbers getting help in care homes and in their own homes for daily tasks such as washing and dressing have been falling in recent years. This trend has been blamed for contributing to the growing pressures being seen in the NHS, particularly the rise in visits to AE. Social care chiefs have said they will need to spend nearly PS20bn on services this year. But even when you take into account the extra money being raised from council tax increases and NHS money that is being transferred across, (both previous policy announcements to help out the sector) councils are still nearly PS1bn short of what they need. By 2020 that funding gap is predicted to grow to PS2.6bn. The money announced in the Budget will go some way to plugging that gap, but clearly not all the way. It is expected to be phased in - with PS1bn coming next year and the remaining PS1bn spread out over the subsequent two. This will go into a pot shared across both services for the elderly, and those provided to younger adults with disabilities. Charities have called it a \"sticking plaster\" to the wider problems facing the sector. Although, to be fair to the chancellor, he said the extra money would be followed by a green paper later in the year to overhaul the entire system, which has remained largely unchanged since it was created along with the NHS, after the Second World War. About 500,000 people in England pay the full cost of their care in England. This can prove very expensive. One in 10 people face costs of over PS100,000 once they pass the age of 65. And there is growing evidence these self-funders are helping to prop up the council-funded side of the market. Analysts LaingBuisson have calculated that the fees councils pay care home firms are PS100 a week below the actual cost of providing the care. Its researchers say this shortfall has effectively created a \"hidden care tax\" with self-funders now paying more than 25 extra for the same care. To limit these costs the coalition government announced in 2013 it would be introducing a cap on the cost of care so no-one paid more than PS72,000 over their lifetime. This was meant to be introduced in 2016, but that was delayed until 2020. The green paper that was announced in the Budget will set out how - indeed if - that policy will be incorporated into any future changes. But the extra money will do nothing to help these people. More than 4m people over the age of 65 have care needs, but only about 1.35m of them get formal care - either by paying for it themselves or relying on council help. What happens to the rest? There are 1.5m people who are cared for by family and friends and another 1.2m who struggle by with little or no help. In theory councils could use the extra money to increase the number of people they help. But given there's already a shortfall in funding to maintain the status quo, it seems doubtful this will happen. Again, the promise of longer-term reform remains their best hope. They may also benefit from extra support announced in the Budget for the NHS. There is PS100m extra to help AEs ahead of next winter and PS325m over the next three years to help with NHS reform by getting local plans off the ground to shift care out of hospitals and into community services. Eventually this should help boost services such as GPs and district nursing, which the frail elderly are heavy users of. However, given the health budget is currently nearly PS120bn a year, the impact of this extra money will be limited. Read more from Nick Follow Nick on Twitter",

The German also thinks Henry Surtees would \"still be around if we had this type of system.\" John Surtees, who won the 1964 drivers' championship with Ferrari, said: \"Lewis could perhaps think a little more about the'halo' and think about the responsibility he does have as a world champion. \"Change comes about and sometimes changes are forced upon one. It may be that the governing body, just because of the momentum and the fact that they have gone this way, will have no option but to impose these regulations. \"Henry was hit by a wheel that weighed 28kg so there would have been a chance there [had a'halo' been installed].\" McLaren's Fernando Alonso, meanwhile, says the'halo' device is a \"necessary\" step. \"It will be the future of F1, because we cannot afford any serious injury or fatal accident as we had in the last two years,\" said the two-time world champion, referring to the fatal injuries sustained by Jules Bianchi and Justin Wilson. \"I know the'halo' is a little extreme in terms of aesthetics - maybe a canopy or other solution is found in the next couple of months - but hopefully next year we have one of these systems in all the cars.\" Read more about the'halo' here",
        "The scoring began in the fourth minute when Darren Carter's dummy set up Keanu Marsh-Brown to put Rovers ahead but Dan Sparkes then netted twice in seven minutes for the visitors, with David Fitzpatrick providing both assists. Rovers quickly levelled through Marsh-Brown's second of the game but Torquay, 4-3 winners on Boxing Day, were back in front at half-time after Aman Verma headed in Fitzpatrick's free-kick. Another Fitzpatrick cross then resulted in Ethan Pinnock putting into his own net to double Torquay's lead five minutes into the second half. Christian Doidge gave Rovers hope in the 62nd minute after Torquay failed to deal with Dale Bennett's cross but Fitzpatrick then grabbed the goal he deserved with a stunning free-kick from 25 yards to seemingly seal the win. Rovers stormed back in the closing stages though, with Doidge pouncing from close range after Elliott Frear's shot was parried before Torquay goalkeeper Brendan Moore pushed the ball into his own goal to gift Rovers an 88th-minute equaliser. The hosts almost snatched a dramatic winner in stoppage time as Doidge headed a corner against the crossbar. Report supplied by the Press Association.

        "The bung was left in place after the procedure at Northampton General Hospital. A report which went before the hospital's public trust board said the patient was discharged home and the bung fell out four days later. The hospital has apologised for the incident and said it had learned from the error. It was one of two \"never events\" to happen at the hospital in Cliftonville in 2016. A hospital spokesman said details could not be given of the second incident - that happened in January - due to confidentiality reasons but it was described as \"wrong site surgery\" in July's report. The spokesman said: \"Almost 80,000 procedures are performed annually by our medical and nursing staff. \"We are committed to providing each and every one of our patients with a high level of safe care and are deeply sorry that, in these two cases, a vital aspect of the care provided fell short of the standard we would expect. \"We don't underestimate the effect of a never event on our patients and our staff. That is why we believe we need to openly tackle these issues on the rare occasions they occur. \"We have undertaken thorough investigations into the circumstances surrounding each of these never events and reported them to the Care Quality Commission, NHS England and our commissioners. \"As a result of our investigations we have improved our theatre reporting and recording systems.\"",

        "The American band had been set to perform in Bellahouston Park on Tuesday. However, promoters PCL said the show had been cancelled because \"adverse weather conditions\" meant it was \"no longer safe\" for the bands to perform. In a statement on their website Green Day said they were \"very distraught.\" They said the stage was deemed \"unsafe for the fans and everyone involved.\" The band added: \"We are very distraught about this as we are in Glasgow now and were very much looking forward to this show as one the highlights of our tour. \"We have been playing in extreme weather conditions throughout this European tour, and the last thing we want to do is see a show cancelled. \"We love our Scottish fans and we don't care if it's raining.... sideways, although the safety of our fans and our crew is always our top priority. \"We love you Scotland, we love the city of Glasgow and it goes without saying that we will be back.\" In a strongly worded post on Instagram, the band's bassist Mike Dirnt posted a video of himself next to a Saltire. He said: \"We are devastated and it.... sucks that the show today has been cancelled due to safety issues. \"I know today's show would have been insane! I'm at a loss for words and so disappointed right now, but please know we will be back ASAP! Rage Love.\" Disappointed fans have also voiced their anger at the last-minute announcement. Charlotte Durcan, from Lincolnshire, said she and her family had travelled nearly four hours to attend the concert. \"We arrived safely, paid for parking, paid for our hotel, and at 13:45 received an e-mail to say that the concert has been cancelled,\" she said. \"We could have saved our money,\" she added. \"The hotel won't reimburse us as there is a 72-hour notice period. We will be staying there for one night only as we just came for the concert. We're not really sure how to pass the time now. \"It's my first time in Glasgow and it has ruined my Glasgow experience.\" Many ticket holders took to social media to express their disappointment. One said she was \"absolutely devastated\" by the decision, after waiting seven years to see the band perform in Scotland. Others raised questions over the weather conditions, claiming that T in the Park and Glastonbury often go ahead in heavy rain. It also led to queries about how well prepared the organisers were for the sell-out concert. Glasgow City Council, which operates Bellahouston Park, said they did not tell the promoters to cancel the gig. They said the decision was taken by the promoters and the band's management, who informed the council of the move. The promoters announced the cancellation on Twitter shortly before 13:30. The gates were due to open at 14:00. They said fans would receive refunds. In a statement, they said: \"Adverse weather conditions overnight and throughout the morning, during the bands scheduled load in, led to issues on stage. \"A meeting between the on site health and safety, event management, the artists representatives and promoters concluded that it would be unsafe in the timescale to proceed with the event.\" Police Scotland said they had officers at the park advising fans that the gig was cancelled and ensuring that they got home safely. Green Day were due to be supported by Rancid, Slaves and Skids. Slaves hastily arranged a replacement gig, announcing on Twitter that the \"good people of Glasgow still need a gig.\" It quickly sold out.",
        "He said the Bank took \"timely, comprehensive and concrete\" action, which acted to \"support, cushion and help the economy to adjust.\" Last month's rate cut to an historic low of 0.25 helped support house prices and the wider economy, he added. He added he was \"absolutely serene\" about the Bank's preparations for the impact from the Brexit vote. Mr Carney was being questioned by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee about how the Bank handled the referendum outcome and its decision to cut interest rates to a record low. The Bank was criticised by Brexit supporters for saying the economy would be hit from a vote to leave the EU. But Mr Carney said the Bank's decisions had so far been \"validated.\" The \"extraordinary preparations\" made by the Bank \"cushioned\" the economy and will help the UK \"make a success of Brexit,\" he told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee. He said the Bank's actions were made in an effort \"to help make the leaving of the EU a success as quickly as possible.\" \"This financial system, under the oversight of the Bank of England, sailed through what was a surprise to the vast majority of financial market participants,\" Mr Carney said. MPs questioned whether the Bank was too aggressive in supporting the economy after the vote. The UK's services, manufacturing and construction industries have all showed signs of recovery in August after taking a hit in July. However, Mr Carney said he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with the Bank's decision to cut interest rates to 0.25 and pump billions of pounds into the economy. He added that it is \"welcome there is a rebound\" in the economy. Mr Carney said there has been quite a considerable improvement in mortgage borrowing costs \"and we are seeing pass through of our actions.\" When Labour MP Rachel Reeves raised concerns that the majority of lenders had yet to pass on the full cut in rates, Mr Carney said the Bank expected \"virtually\" all the rate cut to be passed on to borrowers in the next few months.",
        "Bernard Kenny, 78, was stabbed as he intervened when Thomas Mair attacked Mrs Cox in his home village of Birstall, West Yorkshire, a year ago. PCs Craig Nicholls and Jonathan Wright - who arrested Mair - have also received Queen's Gallantry Medals. Unarmed, they pursued him despite knowing he may have a gun and a knife. The late politician's senior caseworker, Sandra Major, who witnessed the killing, receives an MBE for parliamentary services and service to the community in Batley and Spen. Mrs Cox, the Labour MP for the Yorkshire constituency of Batley and Spen, was stabbed and shot outside Birstall Library on 16 June 2016. After the attack more than 80,000 people signed an online petition calling for Mr Kenny to be awarded the George Cross for his bravery. At Mair's trial at the Old Bailey, the jury heard Mr Kenny was waiting for his wife outside the library in Birstall when he saw Mair going \"berserk.\" He said in statement to police: \"I thought if I could jump on to the back I could take him down. \"I thought he was thumping her until I saw the blood. I saw he had a knife in his hands. \"Just as I got short of him, he turned around and saw me. He shoved the knife in and it hit me in the stomach. The blood started pouring out between my fingers. I saw the blood and I thought'Oh my God'.\" Mr Kenny said: \"I am honoured to receive such an award.\" After the attack, Mair left the scene armed with a knife and a gun and was followed by PC Nicholls and PC Wright. Realising the public could be in danger, the officers chased the suspect and arrested him. 'Heroic actions' PC Nicholls said he was \"honoured, surprised and humbled\" to receive the gallantry award. \"Our thoughts remain with Jo's family and friends. We have met members of her family who are incredible and extremely positive. \"On the day this happened, we were not due on patrol but our training was cancelled. \"When we heard what was happening we went straight to the area - we knew who we were looking for and what we were going towards but we knew that if he wasn't stopped he could hurt someone else,\" he said. PC Wright said: \"I didn't expect this - it's taken me completely by surprise.

        "A new report published by the corporation showed licence money spending had a positive knock-on effect for regional economies. The total expenditure over the two-year period came to PS4.3bn, which led to a gross value-added (GVA) boost to the economy of PS8.3bn. However, spending in London was three times the rest of the UK combined. The report said: \"The effect of initial BBC spending is'multiplied' as it ripples through the economy from region to region and sector to sector (and to the employees of those sectors). This is known as the'multiplier effect'.\" The BBC's chief economic and policy adviser Najma Rajah explained: \"The basic premise is that when the BBC spends a pound, the impact of that pound is'multiplied' as that pound spent by the BBC creates value elsewhere in the economy. \"So, for example, if the BBC were to buy a camera from a supplier in Manchester, the camera supplier would receive some money in return for the camera. \"The camera company would then use the income generated from the sale of the camera to pay their suppliers for the components that went into the camera and to also pay their employees and so on.\" Rajah added: \"A really good example of how this multiplier effect works is when the BBC commissions a programme that is made by an independent television production. \"The programme might be filmed in Scotland using local runners, electricians, make-up artists etc. who are paid and then will spend their wages in Scotland to the benefit of the Scottish economy.\" The report revealed significant growth in the north of England following the opening of the new BBC North headquarters in Salford Quays, with GVA growing 19.7 to PS391m. But in the Midlands, it fell 21.7 to PS199m, while the south was down 18.8 to PS699m and Wales dropped 6.2 to PS276m. London saw the biggest expenditure of PS2.98bn - nearly three times as much as the rest of the UK combined - which in turn generated PS5.65bn GVA. John Tate, the BBC's director of policy and strategy, used the findings of the report to call on Ofcom to reverse its plans for a spectrum tax on broadcasters next year. In a blog post he wrote: \"The wider benefit of the licence fee provides an extra reason for Ofcom to think again before it implements a spectrum tax next year: a levy on the spectrum broadcasters use to transmit their programmes. \"As well as hitting licence fee payers, such a tax would remove much-needed cash from the UK's creative sector.\"",

Previously walkers were allowed to walk up-to six charges, but this has been curbed with the new Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO). One professional dog walker said it will affect business. Nick Lower, who runs Gosport Dog Walking, said: \"There are a few professional dog walkers who are going to be affected, and members of the public as well.\" Sue McNaughton, who will now have to walk her five huskies in two packs said: \"I understand where [the council] are coming from, but they're penalising the many because of the few. \"I wouldn't walk five dogs if I didn't think I could control them.\" Councillor Graham Burgess said: \"In a densely-populated borough like Gosport, we do believe new rules are needed.\" Some residents are happy about the change, including Jenny Brown who said: \"I'm pleased this has come into focus. I've had so many problems when encountering larger groups of dogs.\" Similar fines are in place in other areas including Oxford. In 2011 the council brought in fines for people walking more than four dogs after complaints of packs being out of control. Councillor John Tanner said: \"With more than four dogs, you are not taking your dog out for a walk but a pack of potentially dangerous animals for a riot around the park.\"",
        "Divers found the juvenile's bones by chance in a vast, flooded limestone chamber on the Yucatan Peninsula. Aged 15 or 16 at death, the girl lived at least 12,000 years ago. Researchers have told Science Magazine her DNA backs the idea that the first Americans and modern Native American Indians share a common ancestry. This theory argues that people from Siberia settled on the land bridge dubbed Beringia that linked Asia and the Americas some 20,000 years ago before sea levels rose. These people then moved south to populate the American continents. The genetics of modern Native Americans would certainly appear to link them into this story. But their facial features set them apart from the oldest skeletons now being unearthed. These ancient people had narrower, longer skulls. The differences have hinted that perhaps there were multiple immigrations from Siberia (or even Europe). However, the remains of the Yucatan girl, dubbed Naia - which means \"water nymph\" in Greek - does not follow that line of thinking, because although she had the slender features associated with the earliest Americans, her DNA shares commonalities with modern Native Americans. Lab analysis of teeth and bone samples link her to a particular genetic lineage known as Haplogroup D1. This same marker is found in substantial numbers of modern Native Americans. \"This lineage is thought to have developed in Beringia, the land that now lies beneath the Bering Sea after its ice age occupants became genetically isolated from the rest of Asia,\" explained lead author Dr Jim Chatters. \"Thus, Naia, one of the earliest occupants of the Americas yet found, suggests that Paleoamericans do not represent an early migration from a part of the world different than that of the Native Americans. \"Rather, Paleoamericans and Native Americans descended from the same homeland in Beringia. \"The differences between them likely arose from evolution that occurred after the Beringian gene pool became separated from the rest of the world.\" The Yucatan Peninsula is famous for its giant limestone sinkholes, or cenotes. The chamber where the girl was found represents one of these pits before its roof has collapsed to produce a wide surface opening. To reach the natural amphitheatre, divers had to swim almost 1km (0.6 miles) through a water-filled tunnel. \"The moment we entered inside, we knew it was an incredible place,\" recalled Alberto Nava. \"The floor disappeared under us and we could not see across to the other side. We pointed our lights down and to the side; all we could see was darkness. \"We felt as if our powerful underwater lights were being destroyed by this void. So we called it'black hole', which in Spanish is'Hoyo Negro'.\" Scientists can only speculate as to why Naia had been in the cavern. Skeletal remains of many animals also litter the pit's floor. The suspicion is that they all were looking for water, because the region had a very dry climate 12,000 years ago and the cavern would have been mostly dry but for a few pools. Perhaps they stumbled and fell to their death in the darkness. \"Her pelvis is broken and it appears to have been broken at or around the time of her death because it's fractured in a way that relatively young bone would break rather than ancient bone,\" said Dr Chatters. \"So, it appears she fell quite a distance and struck something hard. I think she died almost instantly, if not instantly.\" On the face of it, the new study supports research published in February that looked at the genetics of an infant who died at about the same time in what is now the US State of Montana. This investigation of \"Anzick\" boy, as he has become known, was conducted on the main DNA material found in the nuclei of the cells. Naia's DNA, on the other hand, was sourced from outside the nuclei of her cells - in structures called the mitochondria. These carry much more limited information. Dr Shane Doyle from Montana State University said Dr Chatters' team therefore still had some ground to travel before very robust conclusions could be drawn. \"In my view they have a way to go before they can say anything substantial,\" he told BBC News. \"It's extremely difficult to get at the nuclear DNA and decoding it is very complex, but this is what they need to do. Until they do that, they cannot tell us a lot about where Native American Indians came from.\" Dr Chatters confirmed that unravelling Naia's nuclear genome was a future priority. and follow me on Twitter: BBCAmos",
        "Out Among the Stars comes out in March and features 12 tracks by the American singer, recorded for Columbia Records in 1981 and 1984. It includes duets with Cash's wife June Carter and friend Waylon Jennings. The tracks have never been made public before. They were not released at the time and the singer, who had fallen out of fashion, was later dropped by his record label. The recordings came to light only when John Carter Cash found them, gathering dust in a vault, while he was cataloguing the singer's private archive in 2012. He found hundreds of reels of unreleased live and studio recordings in the vault, including duets with Bob Dylan. It is the fourth posthumous album released since Johnny Cash died in 2003, aged 71. Speaking to the BBC, Carter Cash said: \"There is more music to be released that is unheard, there are some great recordings. \"But we don't want to release something unless it means something. \"It has to be in line with what we believe my father would have wanted released.\" The unreleased recordings will bolster what is already a lucrative business for the Cash estate. In 2009, he sold more than three million records, reportedly earning more than 8m (PS4.9m). But Carter Cash maintained \"the world would be a darker place\" if the music was not released and it was \"worth doing\" if fans around the world wanted to hear it. \"Do you want to see another Picasso if there's one that nobody has ever seen before?\" he asked. \"I would say that probably the world would want to see another Picasso. And it's really the same thing. This is a work of art.\" To date, Johnny Cash sold more than 90 million records. He is best known for songs including Ring of Fire and I Walk the Line and famously performed for inmates in American prisons. \"He would sing the songs for the underdogs,\" said Carter Cash. \"He would reach out to people that no one else would reach out to.\"",

His wife Lynne previously said doctors told her the illness was \"caused by heading too many balls.\" Turner also played for Cambridge United, Luton, Swindon and Southend. He started his playing career at Peterborough in 1969 and made more than 300 appearances. His playing career also included time in the US. Turner retired as a player in 1984 and took over as boss at Cambridge United a year later, managing them until 1990.

        "Sir Bernard announced the move to reassure the public and deter attackers following terrorist attacks in Europe. The Met has already said the number of armed officers will go up in London by 600 to 2,800. And a further 900 armed officers are planned to be in operation for the rest of England and Wales. But Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said it may take two years to fully train the 1,500 recruits planned nationally. \"When you're recruiting 1,500 it's going to take a lot of time. You've got to find the resources, the facilities and the people,\" he told the BBC. However, Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for firearms, said last month that the majority of new armed officers will be in place by April 2017. The latest announcement comes after 84 people were killed when a lorry ploughed into a large crowd watching a fireworks display in Nice in the south of France last month. Londoners and tourists out enjoying the August sunshine in central London report mixed feelings about more armed police patrolling the city's streets. Teacher Julie Banks, who was visiting from Liverpool, says she finds the news reassuring, \"especially at this time of year when there are more tourists and crowds. We shouldn't be complacent.\" Retired friends John Lee and John Coles, both from London, agree. \"It's a good thing. It's not going to stop a terror attack, but it makes people feel more secure,\" Mr Coles says. \"I never thought I would see the day British police carried weapons in the street like this, but I think that needs to happen now - whether we like it or not,\" Mr Lee adds. Bricklayer Gary Johns, 34, approved, but says: \"The real question is what their response time is.\" Others, however, say the sight of police carrying heavy weapons makes them uneasy. \"It makes me more nervous than secure to be honest,\" says Bryony Wood, a make-up artist, 26, from west London. \"It's a reminder of what might happen.\" \"I have mixed feelings about it,\" says Ebuka Orunta, 20, from south London. \"On one hand I feel safer knowing the Met has a strategy in place to mitigate the risk. \"On the other hand, we've seen the problems with police brutality in the US. It's important the people in charge of this weaponry are the right people who are going to protect us.\" Sir Bernard said: \"We have no intelligence that there will be an attack shortly but what we do know is what we have seen in western Europe. \"We have seen attacks in Germany, in Belgium, in France and we would be foolish to ignore that, so it's important that we get officers out there with firearms to respond.\" The commissioner said the increased firearms teams would be patrolling randomly around the clock. It comes after he told a newspaper that a terror attack on the UK is highly likely and a case of \"when, not if.\" Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Met chief said there was a \"sense of fear\" in Britain. Mr Khan said: \"It's really important that Londoners are reassured that the police service, that the security service, that all of us are doing our bit to keep Londoners in our city safe... \"The threat level hasn't changed but we are learning the lessons from Europe, from Nice, from Paris, from Munich.\" By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani The Metropolitan Police have long aimed to make the capital as \"hostile\" an environment as possible for any would-be attacker to carry out a mass-casualty attack. But if they can't stop someone attacking, the goal is to have enough armed police available to get to the scene of an atrocity quickly to minimise casualties and neutralise the threat. Armed police reached the scene of the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby 11 minutes after the 999 call. The attackers were not armed with automatic weapons and just stood there waiting for police to arrive, rather than attacking anyone else. Clearly, in a Paris-style scenario, 11 minutes is a long, long time so a great deal of today's security planning aims to accelerate how quickly specialist firearms officers could reach a scene. None of which addresses a much bigger issue: what if the attack isn't in London, Birmingham or Manchester? Major cities may be well-resourced - but preparing to respond to an incident elsewhere is far more challenging. The Met said the new armed officers would be \"working alongside their neighbourhood and specialist colleagues,\" and Mr Khan said there would be a second dedicated PC in every London ward by the end of next year. In Munich, Germany, nine people died in a shooting at a shopping centre in July while in November 2015, gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris. Meanwhile, Mr White expressed his concern about the time it would take to put the plan in place. \"What we've got to make sure is that we have the resources in the right place at the right time and we've also got to recognise that this isn't London-centric.... a terrorist attack could happen anywhere in the country.\" Firearms officers in the Metropolitan Police have to undergo a comprehensive selection and training process before they are allowed on to the streets with a gun.",
        "Details of the amount paid by the consortium and the total stake acquired have not been disclosed. The takeover ends Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti's troubled three-year stay as O's owner. The club recently staved off a winding-up petition at the High Court, having paid off debts to four creditors. Following the dismissal of the winding-up petition, representatives of the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust (LOFT) had urged Becchetti to sell the club \"urgently to any new responsible owner.\" In a statement on the Orient website, Becchetti said the club had been sold without any \"debts to the bank\" and \"without arrears for taxes.\" \"Over the last two years, I have, unfortunately, not been able to dedicate myself to following the club as closely as I would have wanted,\" he continued. \"This is clearly the moment to leave the club to others and I know that in doing so I am leaving it in good hands with Nigel Travis.\" Travis, who describes himself as a \"lifelong\" O's fan, has been appointed as chairman of the club. A second investor, Kent Teague, has been named as a director, while a fan representative will also be appointed to the board. Local businessman Marshall Taylor has been appointed interim chief executive, while former Orient owner Barry Hearn will retain ownership of the club's stadium at Brisbane Road. \"Barry and I actually went to school together,\" Travis told BBC Radio London. \"Barry did a great job previously [as owner]. We're going to take some lessons from what he did and bring in some new stuff, but he remains the owner of the stadium and that's the way it's going to stay.\" Travis has taken over the club in a personal capacity, with Dunkin' Brands, the parent company of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins, not involved in the deal. Leyton Orient had been beaten in the League One play-off final less than two months before Becchetti purchased the club in July 2015, but last season their 112-year stay in the English Football League came to an end with relegation from League Two. The club had 11 managers or head coaches under Becchetti's ownership, including five different bosses last season alone. They have been reported to have only 15 senior players under contract for next season, with the oldest of those players being 20-year-old Charlie Grainger. Manager Omer Riza is only under contract until 30 June, with the club's first pre-season game scheduled for 12 July. \"We're going to make an announcement on the football side tomorrow [Friday],\" said Travis. \"They will be the two key appointments. The idea is the board doesn't get involved in the day-to-day things.\"",

        "She told The Sun her three rivals were all \"continuity Miliband\" candidates who would not connect with aspirational low and middle income voters. It come as another contender, Yvette Cooper, sets out a plan to create two million high tech jobs. Ms Cooper, Ms Kendall, Andy Burnham and Jeremy Corbyn will take part in a leadership hustings later. The four MPs are vying to succeed Mr Miliband as Labour leader, with the result of the election to be announced in early September. The campaign so far has been dominated by the candidates' attitudes to Labour's election defeat and how far they are willing to distance themselves from the policies put forward by Mr Miliband. Claims by Ms Kendall and her supporters that only she would break from the past have led to a war of words between their rival camps. In an interview with the Sun, Ms Kendall said she made no apology for calling for a complete change of approach, claiming that \"if we stick with what we have been saying for the last five or eight years, we will have the same result.\" \"I think I am the only person in this race that isn't continuity Miliband,\" she said. \"The other candidates haven't spelled out how they would be different from Ed Miliband.\" In a direct appeal to readers of the Sun, which was highly critical of Mr Miliband's leadership, Ms Kendall said Labour needed to show it could be trusted with people's money and had more to say to homeowners and those who run their own business. \"We have got to get back to the values of the British people - work, responsibility, wanting to get on, wanting to be a success, and being proud of that - not making people ashamed or think somehow that they are doing something wrong.\" During a campaign visit to the University of Manchester, Ms Cooper will argue that Britain is being \"left behind\" as a country, with its spending on research and development and science lagging behind that of other comparable European economies. Even when major scientific discoveries are made in the UK, such as with graphene - a material that has been been touted as having the scope to transform electronics - she said the UK has often been slow to exploit their commercial potential. Acknowledging that Labour's relationship with business is in \"real need of recovery,\" she said a future Labour government must aspire to spend 3 of the UK's national output on science and RD to bring it into line with the likes of Germany. Such a financial commitment, backed by a 10-year plan, was needed to create two million high-skilled manufacturing jobs, she said. \"Britain can't compete with Brazil or Indonesia on low-wage, low-skills jobs,\" she said. \"But with high-skilled jobs in emergent technologies, in the harnessing of new technologies such as graphene, we can do what we've done before: punch well above our weight as a small island off the coast of Europe. That should be Labour's mission.\" All small businesses, she argued, should have guaranteed access to high-speed broadband since the digital economy was crucial to Britain's future long-term competitiveness. Stressing that Labour must be the champion of innovation as the route to greater productivity, she recalled Harold Wilson's famous prediction in 1963 that a new Britain would be forged in the \"white heat\" of a scientific revolution. \"Just as Labour championed the white heat of technology in the 1960s, so today we need to champion the white flashing constellations of the networked world.\" The Conservatives have pledged to spend 2.5 of GDP on science and RD by 2020 while Chancellor George Osborne has said Manchester will be heart of a northern powerhouse, underpinned by investment in world-class science and research facilities. The four candidates will take part in a hustings in Manchester later, organised by trade union Unison.",
        "Hodgson made six changes, including resting captain Wayne Rooney, from the win against Wales - but a limp performance means Chris Coleman's side finish top of Group B and England's life is now more difficult if they go deeper into Euro 2016. England had the better chances, with Slovakia keeper Matus Kozacik saving well when Jamie Vardy broke clear in the first half, as well as blocking crucially from Nathaniel Clyne after the break. Rooney came on for the struggling Jack Wilshere after 55 minutes, but the pattern was set and Slovakia defended manfully for what should prove to be a precious point. Dele Alli had also a shot kicked off the line by Martin Skrtel just seconds after coming on as a substitute on the hour. England now travel to Nice where they face the team that finishes second in Group F - either Hungary, Portugal, Iceland or Austria - next Monday. It was a major surprise that Hodgson chose to make such mass alterations to an England team that had finally picked up some momentum with Thursday's last-gasp victory over Wales. That win put them in position to top the group by beating Slovakia. Instead, with nothing decided and with the group still open, Hodgson chose to leave out Rooney, Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Dele Alli, Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. Hodgson introduced Vardy and Daniel Sturridge, who both scored against Wales, as well as Clyne, Ryan Bertrand, Wilshere and Jordan Henderson. It gave England a disjointed look and they ran out of steam and threat long before the end. Time will tell if this was the selection that proved decisive in England's Euro 2016 campaign - but the bottom line is when you make a controversial choice such as that, you need to win and Hodgson's side failed. Wilshere was given a starting role as Hodgson shuffled his squad to inject freshness and to give those on the margins some game time - but it was a move that failed. The 24-year-old Arsenal midfielder looked exactly what he is at the moment: less than fully fit and off the pace after a Premier League season where injuries meant he barely featured. Wilshere played just 141 minutes of Premier League football over three games at the end of Arsenal's season. This was no sort of preparation for a major tournament and it showed, but such is Hodgson's belief in his talents that he could not resist the temptation to select him, against all logic. He strived to somehow revive his best moments but it was not to be - not through any lack of effort, simply a lack of spark, his natural game dulled by the long absences. Wilshere looked a dejected figure as he went off to be replaced by Rooney after only 55 minutes, the possibility growing that his chances of making a serious impact on Euro 2016 badly damaged. The result leaves them off to the south of France and Nice, playing next Monday instead of Saturday - but they will surely regret not finishing top of Group B. This luxury now goes deservedly to Wales and while England will regard themselves as favourites to beat whoever finishes second in Group F, the price they pay could come further down the line. They now go into the half of the draw containing France, Germany and Italy - and will also have to regain the impetus they had finally built up by beating Wales but was lost in this disappointing draw. Not a good night for England. Not a good night for Roy Hodgson. England manager Roy Hodgson: \"If we had won the game people would say we didn't miss them [the players who were left out] and when we don't they say the team selection is wrong, I am used to that one. \"Finishing second is a disappointment but we are still in the last 16 and who is to say the team we will play will be that much stronger? \"You just don't know, the way we are playing I am not frightened of anybody.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Slovakia coach Jan Kozak: \"Our players tired as the game went on and England showed their quality and strength, but when you see an opportunity you give everything you can. \"Perhaps I didn't expect to be pressed so deeply but we made some substitutions to neutralise the impact of their attack.\" England play their last-16 tie on Monday, 27 June at 20:00 BST, while Slovakia will have to wait to find out if they finish as one of the four best third-placed sides who progress.

        "William Porterfield completed his 16th Ireland century as they added 73 runs before declaring on 240-7 to leave the Dutch needing an unlikely 343 to win. Stephan Myburgh's 85 steadied the Dutch after Wesley Barresi suffered a duck. A 60-run partnership by Ben Cooper and Peter Borren left the Dutch on 186-4 as played was halted at 18:30 BST. After a number of rain delays in the contest, Ireland utilised their right to play for another hour after the scheduled finish time of 18:00 BST before captains Porterfield and Borren shook hands. Resuming on their overnight 167-4, Porterfield batted for just 11 more overs before declaring for the second time in the game. By then Porterfield had shown all his class in an excellent 108 while Kevin O'Brien had chipped in with a quick-fire 50. The visitors' unlikely run chase took an early blow as Tim Murtagh trapped Barresi lbw without scoring. However, a second-wicket partnership of 107 between Myburgh and Dan ter Braak helped ensure that they would leave Dublin with a share of the spoils. Simi Singh was best with the ball for Ireland in the second innings with 2-19 as unbeaten knocks of 37 and 25 from Cooper and Peter Borren ensured the dogged Dutch earned a deserved draw. The result moved Ireland to the top of the Intercontinental Cup table but they will need to beat Scotland in November and hope that Afghanistan slip up in the one of the two remaining games to retain the title.",
        "For most footballers, the recovery time they get after training and between matches usually means plenty of golf, or computer games. But saving birds by re-homing them after they have finished their commercial lives is what keeps Wales international Allen busy. \"The football can threaten to take over at times but spending time with my family and pets is very important to me so I always find a way to get the right balance,\" he told the British Hen Welfare Trust publication. Media playback is not supported on this device Allen, though, isn't the only professional player using his downtime in a different way. Arsenal goalkeeper Cech fills his time by performing fills - on his drum kit. The Czech Republic international posts videos online showing him drumming along to rock bands like the Foo Fighters. He credits drumming with improving his keeping skills too, recently telling the Arsenal Weekly podcast: \"It is especially useful for a goalkeeper. There are so many things I learn on the drums that I can use in goalkeeping as well, because the hand-eye coordination and the independence on each of the limbs is helpful.\" Cech showed off his musical skills in a Christmas video for the Arsenal foundation, alongside team-mates Alexis Sanchez and Nacho Monreal. Media playback is not supported on this device The former Liverpool defender is now playing back home in Denmark, at Brondby. The prototype inked footballer was one of the first to sport tattoo sleeves but is also capable of etching his designs onto others - he's a qualified tattoo artist. The Russian ex-Arsenal forward is still playing for Kairat at the age of 34, but when his career ends he can still fall back on the fashion design skills he learned at university, where his thesis was on tracksuit design. Turns out he's pretty handy with a needle and thread, too. Tottenham and Manchester United fans used to say he was an artist when he played in the Premier League. Now playing for PAOK in Greece, the Bulgarian striker is as deft with a pencil in his hand as he is with the ball at his feet. He has posted sketches of rapper Snoop Dogg, actor Marlon Brando and the Breaking Bad cast to his social media accounts. The Everton full-back, 35, has not made a first-team appearance this season, which will have given him more time to focus on his carp fishing empire. Like Allen, Hibbert was a cover star of a non-football magazine - the Angling Times - in 2013 after catching a 42lb beast at his private fishery in France - the aptly named Lac de Premiere. An ex-Millwall centre-half with a love of felines. The 37-year-old former Premier League defender is now captain at League Two Yeovil Town, but has a family business on the side - a cattery in Hertfordshire. BBC Sport visited the cats home in 2011 and Ward said: \"Playing for Millwall you've got to be thick-skinned. You do get some eyebrows raised and a few giggles.\" Put a plate full of wild mushrooms in front of ex-Barcelona and Spain great Xavi Hernandez, and he'll be able to name every one.

        "That phrase hinted both at an ideal flexible arrangement in the future and an ideal shared approach from both the UK and Irish governments, together stressing to the EU the paramount importance of doing nothing that might constitute any kind of risk to the political progress made over recent decades. But is that seamless approach unravelling and could Brexit become a source of greater friction between the two governments? Both the Brexit Secretary David Davis and DUP leader Arlene Foster have been fond of talking about technology as the answer to Ireland's post-Brexit problems. Yes, they acknowledge, putting old-style customs checkpoints right on the border would be unacceptable for both political and security reasons. However, they then go on to suggest that provided businesses co-operate with computerised trusted trader schemes, and cameras with number plate recognition capability are installed some distance away from the frontier, all will be well. By contrast, the Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has now warned that technology isn't the answer. Instead, he argues there is a need for a wider political agreement. What does that mean? On the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond hinted that the Irish favour moving customs controls to seaports and airports, rather than anywhere near the land border. This might sound geographically sensible, but the political implications should not be underestimated. Arlene Foster has previously said that putting a border down the middle of the Irish Sea, creating a divide between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, is something her party will not tolerate. So long as the DUP-Conservative parliamentary arrangement survives, that is a concern David Davis and Theresa May will have to take very seriously. But, if the DUP has the ear of the British government, then similarly as a loyal EU member state, Dublin has the ear of Michel Barnier's negotiating team. Since becoming foreign minister, Simon Coveney has not been shy about making his differences with the UK clear. He voiced his concern for Northern Ireland having special EU status, which contrasted with the position of his predecessor Charlie Flanagan. Some surmised this might only have been a slip of the tongue. However Mr Coveney's decision to let it be known he favoured a bespoke Irish Language Act (Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance's preference) over a hybrid bill (the DUP's suggestion) was a clear move to distance Dublin from the Northern Ireland Office's studied neutrality on the issue. If the border after Brexit becomes a more open source of arm wrestling between the two governments, that could have consequences - not just for the continuing UKEU negotiations, but also for the Stormont talks when they resume in earnest in the autumn.",
        "Comparisons will inevitably be made with the legendary centre and former Irish captain. After all, Ringrose wears the number 13, played for Blackrock, UCD, Leinster and didn't start his rugby career as a centre. But the 22-year-old new kid on the block appears destined to make a name for himself and his entry into the Six Nations fray is keenly anticipated. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt was careful not to throw Ringrose into the international arena too early. But the emerging player is regarded as a young man with a mature head in his shoulders, someone well equipped to handle hype and huge media attention. But, what makes him so special? What are the qualities that had O'Driscoll himself calling for the Leinster lad to be included in Ireland's last Six Nations campaign? \"He has been anointed the next Brian O'Driscoll. Brian was similar at that age, efficient and solid,\" says Eddie O'Sullivan, Ireland's coach from 2001 to 2008. \"Garry's trademark is he is incredibly efficient. Young players make bloopers, but he doesn't make mistakes. It's important to remain calm under pressure and then when your opportunity comes, you take it. \"Brian didn't make mistakes and then he stepped up. No-one expected him to score a try in Paris in 2000, but he scored three. \"Then no-one expected him to score that try against Australia for the Lions a year later, but he did. These are the moments. They came to him and he took them. Then he kicked on, kept improving.\" Ringrose made his senior Ireland debut in the autumn international against Canada last November, a week after being an unused replacement in that historic win over the All Blacks in Chicago. He then scored his first international try in the exciting 27-24 win over Australia in Dublin. Ringrose played his school rugby for Blackrock College in Dublin, although when he joined the senior side, he wasn't seen as one of their better players. Hopping from number nine to 15 and not being offered a permanent position, he kept his head down and eventually an injury opened up a spot at 13. After the switch, he remained their kicker and his points tally propelled Blackrock to the Leinster Senior Cup. Suddenly people were asking who this guy was and he was off to UCD with a glowing reputation. Bobby Byrne, the Director of Rugby at UCD, recalls: \"I first came across Gary in that run to the Senior Cup. He wasn't overly recognised at that stage but suddenly he was having a significant impact for the team. He is the player I am most looking forward to seeing in this year's Six Nations. \"He had composure, was an elusive runner and was really courageous. He hadn't the biggest frame, but he had a good bit of pace to finish off. \"He had, and still has, a great temperament. He is a very balanced guy. The rate of improvement since he has left school has been phenomenal. \"He has improved every year and he's conscious that he always needs to improve, so his discipline on and off the pitch is great. He has all the things that you need to succeed.\" Former Ireland international backs Tony Ward and Jonny Bell are excited about what impact Ringrose can have on this year's Six Nations. Ward, who starred in a famous Munster win over New Zealand in 1978, says: \"He showed us his mental strength in that Australia game last autumn. \"With Robbie Henshaw injured and when Jared Payne came off, he went from being the third or fourth choice to a guy at the top of the heap. \"He really stepped up and I just think he is an amazing talent. He is the player I am most looking forward to seeing in this year's Six Nations.\" Ulster man Bell knows a thing or two about spotting talent. A decorated centre himself, he's now one of the coaches at Gloucester. Again, comparisons with other Irish 13s were impossible to avoid. \"Everyone keeps likening him to Brian O'Driscoll. He can find space, he's elusive and can break tackles. \"He has good leg drive. At this level, you have to have ability. To work against these hard defensive systems, you must have that innate natural ability, and Garry has that in droves.\" According to Bell, Ringrose definitely has the ability and mental strength to succeed, but those qualities need to be complemented by hard work. \"He has a very diligent approach, and that is very important in the modern game,\" adds Bell. \"If you look at the likes of Danny Cipriani, he had amazing ability but he hasn't really produced what he is capable of. He's done well, but not hit the heights he maybe could have because of outside distractions.\" By all accounts, Ringrose has the right mix to succeed at the very top level. If he keeps improving, that step up from first class to world class will seem to be a'when' rather than an'if'. Let's leave the last word to Girvan Dempsey who won 82 Ireland caps between 1998 and 2008 and is now Leinster's backs coach. \"Dealing with him right from the off, even from 17, you could tell he was rugby-smart. He just got it,\" said former full-back Dempsey. \"He just bounces onto the training field. And we're just constantly looking forward to seeing what's going to come next. \"Garry loves expressing himself, and certainly we'd never, ever want to curb that in any way because it's so refreshing. \"Hopefully he'll just keep getting better and better as time goes on.\"",
        "Fighting lasted for several hours near the city of Mazar-e Sharif in northern Balkh province. Insurgents targeted those leaving Friday prayers at the base's mosque and others in a canteen, the army said. The Taliban said in a statement they had carried out the attack, using suicide bombers to breach defences. Earlier estimates put the death toll as high as 134, but a statement from the defence ministry on Saturday gave the figure of more than 100 killed or injured. It is one of the deadliest tolls in a Taliban attack on the Afghan army. At least 10 Taliban militants were also killed in the fighting and one attacker was detained. The Afghan government has declared Sunday a day of national mourning. Separately, the US military command in Afghanistan said that Taliban commander Quari Tayib had been killed in a coalition air strike. It said that Tayib was \"once known as the shadow Taliban governor of Takhar province\" in the north-east, and was killed along with eight other Taliban fighters in the strike on 17 April. The Taliban fighters who attacked the base wore army uniforms and drove through checkpoints to launch the raid, a military spokesman said. One injured soldier, Mohammad Hussain, said: \"When I came out of the mosque, three people with army uniforms and an army vehicle started shooting at us. Of course, they had some infiltrators inside the base, otherwise they would never have been able to enter. \"One of them sitting inside a vehicle had set up a machine gun at the car's window and shot everyone in his way.\" President Ashraf Ghani flew to the area on Saturday and visited wounded troops. US military spokesman John Thomas described the attack as a \"significant\" strike, but he praised Afghan commandos for bringing the \"atrocity to an end.\" There are conflicting reports about casualties. The defence ministry confirmed more than 100 soldiers had been \"killed or injured\" but a security official in Mazar-e Sharif told the BBC that more than 100 had died, including a top military commander. Relatives of some of the soldiers gathered outside the base to take possession of coffins. They all questioned the security measures in place at the main entrance. \"If strict inspections had taken place, the attackers would not have passed the first gate,\" said Jan Agah, from Jowzjan province. One of his nephews serving at the base died and another was injured in the attack. The raid shows the Taliban can plan and carry out complex attacks. The militants said four of the attackers had served as soldiers for a long time and had knowledge of every corner of the base. The base at Mazar-e-Sharif is home to the Afghan National Army's 209th Corps, responsible for providing security to most of northern Afghanistan, including Kunduz province - which has seen heavy recent fighting. Several German and other foreign soldiers are reported to be garrisoned there. Last month about 50 people were reported to have died when militants believed to be from the group known as Islamic State targeted patients and staff at a military hospital in Kabul with guns, grenades and knives. Also in March the Taliban said they had captured the crucial south Afghan district of Sangin after a year-long battle.",

When I first met him, I was impressed with his focus on the job and the preparations he wanted to do. \"Sometimes you introduce people in order to improve you and that is what the powers that be see Wayne doing. \"Whether we need an Aussie or Kiwi to do that, as long as it is pushing our sport forward, that is the main decision that comes into it.\" During McNamara's five-and-a-half-year reign, England were runners-up in the 2011 Four Nations and also reached the semi-finals of the 2013 World Cup. The former Bradford coach's last game in charge saw his side complete a 2-1 series win over New Zealand, the world's number one side. Despite improvement on the international stage, Australian National Rugby League sides thrashed their Super League counterparts in all three games during the World Club Series earlier this year. \"Looking at the World Club Series games, you will see we haven't bridged the gap. But, with the number of top English players we have produced at international level, we are bridging the gap there,\" added O'Loughlin. \"We won the series against New Zealand last year, which was a massive step forward for us. We have teams who are more than capable of competing in the NRL. If Wigan went there, we would improve because of the strength of the competition. \"We may not win more games but it would improve our players massively. Coaches and players over here are always looking to get better and we keep trying to bridge the gap.\" Full-back Sam Tomkins returned to England with Wigan Warriors after a two-year spell with New Zealand Warriors, but has been unable to play this season because of a long-term knee injury. Forward Sam Burgess also returned to rugby league with the South Sydney Rabbitohs after a one-season spell with English rugby union side Bath. \"Just having a bloke like Tomkins back at the club is great,\" said O'Loughlin. \"He has been good for the youngsters who have been playing in his position. He is always there to give his opinion at the club, he is a is positive influence. \"Burgess is a phenomenal player and it is great to have him back in an England jersey. He is is an inspirational player and does his job very well. He is very influential on the team and gets the best from the players around him. \"He is a good leader too. With him in the side, you have a better chance of winning.\"",
        "The U's led at half-time through Piero Mingoia but the game was transformed by goals from Shrimps pair Jack Dunn and Paul Mullin in the space of three minutes after the hour. Winger Mingoia opened the scoring nine minutes before the break, firing across Morecambe goalkeeper Barry Roche after the ball fell to him when Ben Williamson was unable to get a shot away. The visitors levelled in the 62nd minute when Dunn converted from the penalty spot after being brought down by Luke Berry. Dunn was involved again two minutes later, robbing Conor Newton and freeing Mullin down the middle, who rounded keeper Will Norris and fired beyond a man on the line. Medy Elito and Berry both fired wide as the hosts failed to find an equaliser, leaving them without a win in their opening eight league fixtures.

        "Watkins has been banned for four years after he tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone and the stimulant methylhexaneamine. He joins team-mate Shaun Cleary, who has been banned for two years as benzoylecgonine, a cocaine metabolite, was found in his system. Both players tested positive before a friendly against Bridgend Ravens RFC. UKAD Director of Legal, Graham Arthur said: \"Ryan Watkins deliberately ingested nandrolone and methylhexaneamine without any consideration for his responsibilities as an athlete. \"By making this conscious choice to dope, Watkins has chosen to cheat his team-mates, the opposition and his sport. \"I hope this case will act as strong deterrent to other young amateur players - the risks to your playing career, your reputation and more importantly to your health, just aren't worth it.\" Speaking about Cleary, Mr Arthur said: \"Although Mr Cleary used cocaine three days before playing, cocaine was still in his system when he played. \"Cocaine is banned from sport and athletes are solely responsible for what is in their system, regardless of whether there is an intention to cheat or not.\" Welsh Rugby Union chief executive Martyn Phillips said about Cleary: \"This case serves as a strong warning to everyone in the game that non-compliance with anti-doping rules carries grave consequences. \"Whether intentional, or inadvertent, players have a responsibility to themselves, to each other, to their clubs and to the sport to act within the rules and spirit of the game. \"We work closely with UK Anti-Doping and fully adhere to the World Anti-Doping Code. There is no room in the code for carelessness or not knowing. \"We will be relentless in working with UKAD to follow up leads that out players who dope in Welsh rugby.\" Maesteg Harlequins are mid-table in Welsh National League Division One West Central and Cleary has been banned until 10 October, 2017. Watkins is banned until 11 September 2019.",
        "The Scot had already forged a successful karate career, spending six years on the international stage, and then came close to a 2006 Winter Olympic berth in bobsleigh, before winning rowing gold at the London 2012 Paralympics. But now Smith wants to represent Great Britain in a fourth different sport - and hit the road at Rio 2016 as a cyclist. Born with a club foot, he had to learn to walk in special plaster casts, before undergoing emergency spinal surgery in 2010, meaning he had to learn to walk all over again before going on to win gold at his home Paralympics. Life is all about hurdles - it is how we get over them which defines who we are Now he is preparing for his first serious bike race at the International Para-cycling Cup, a three-day event which starts in Newport, Wales, on Friday. \"I hope that it's the start of my journey to Rio,\" Smith told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"To be in Rio in a different sport would be special, so with that in mind my first race is at the velodrome in Wales as a guest rider in the 1km and 4km pursuit.\" The 35-year-old, who teamed up with Pamela Relph, Naomi Riches, James Roe and cox Lily van den Broecke to win mixed coxed four gold, retired from rowing after London 2012 because of deteriorating health. But Smith, born in Dunfermline and now living in Aviemore, is used to overcoming adversity in pursuit of sporting glory, having been born with both feet facing backwards, and had bones repeatedly broken and reset to correct the problem as a child. Still, he grew up to \"fall in love\" with karate. After deciding that six years of \"beat ups\" was enough, Smith gave athletics a try - and he even turned out to have pace to burn. But there are some side effects of having a foot that was nearly amputated at birth. \"I set off in athletics and took to the 400m, but due to my feet I couldn't run around the bends and ended up shattering and having stress fractures all through my right foot and up my right leg and into my hips,\" he said. After being born with a club foot, Smith spent the first three years of his life having his bones broken and reset to correct his foot alignment. By the age of 15, he was competing internationally as a British karate junior. Then, by 2002, he was the brakeman in a British World Cup bobsleigh team. When injury ended his bobsleigh career, he turned to rowing and was soon competing internationally as part of an'adaptive' mixed coxed four crew. Along with the sports that Smith competed for Great Britain, he also won a shinty junior Scottish title, competed in Austria, France and New Zealand in skiing and claimed a East of Scotland 400m athletics title. \"I wasn't massively slow, I was running about 49 seconds in my first year in the sport so I just thought it was just another dream gone. \"It was then that it hit me - I had the bug and really wanted to be an Olympian. I was never going to let it go and it turned into a bit of an obsession.\" By chance, he one day turned on the television and saw bobsleighing. There were no bends, he fancied himself running in a straight line on ice and went for it. He was brakeman for the British four-man bob that fell one hundredth of a second short of making it to the Winter Olympics in Turin. Then a mystery neck injury, a constant pain thought to have been brought on by overtraining, ultimately forced him to give up bobsledding. He calls the realisation that his foot classified him for the Paralympics a \"sliding door\" moment in his life and chose then to take up rowing. And it is not just because that particular sporting adventure started with World Championship victory in 2009 and finished on the top step of the podium at Eton Dorney. Rather, it was team physiotherapist Patrick Dunleavy's discovery in 2010 that there was something not quite right when manipulating his spine. Doctors investigated, discovering that that mystery neck injury was in fact a tumour the size of a tennis ball embedded in his upper spine, behind his throat. \"All I thought about was that I needed to be in London. I never made a team with it [the tumour] in me. But with it taken out there was nothing to stop me from getting to London,\" Smith said. \"There are complications with surgery sometimes and I suffered a blood clot inside the spinal chord. Once they sent me home to Ascot I woke up one morning and was paralysed from the neck down. I was rushed back into hospital for another surgery.\" Media playback is not supported on this device After his second operation he had to learn to walk again, not that Smith would let something like that stop him from achieving his Paralympic dreams. \"I just remember lying there thinking'I'm still going to be in London and going to win gold'. I didn't mean it in an arrogant way. I just wanted it so, so much and would do anything to get to the start line.\" Scar tissue from that life-threatening spinal surgery - with surgeons opting to go through the front of his neck and around his windpipe and vocal chords to access the spine - eventually led to his retirement from rowing and now poses new problems. He even has plans to cycle around the world, but after being invited to trial with the GB cycling team he admits his appetite for competition is far from satisfied. \"My one love is pulling on that GB top and competing - it's that one moment when you are competing and your heart rate is over 170 and you are giving it everything,\" he said. \"I don't really know what the future holds, I have to go in for more scans to see what is happening with the scar tissue because if that continues to grows to the same size as the tumour it will cause the same problems. \"Life is all about hurdles - it is how we get over them which defines who we are.\" Interview by BBC Radio Berkshire's Adrian Williams.",

        "Ryan Matthews, 62, was already serving a life sentence for double murder when he killed Sharon Wall at Wotton Lawn Hospital in Gloucester, where he lived. Ms Wall was stabbed twice in the back on 9 July and could not be saved despite efforts from hospital staff. Matthews pleaded guilty to the 53-year-old's murder in December. Police and NHS investigations have failed to establish how Matthews got hold of the knife he used. However Shaun Clee, chief executive of the Gloucestershire 2gether NHS Foundation Trust, said the attack was \"neither predictable nor preventable.\" He admitted his staff had \"no idea\" where he got the murder weapon from but said it was not one of the \"sharps\" on the unit, which were \"controlled\" and \"moderated.\" Matthews has changed his name several times and was convicted under the name of Stephen Cecil King for two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to murder in 1983. Gloucestershire Police said his mental health had been deteriorating throughout a number of hospital placements since 1999 when he left Broadmoor prison under the provisions of the Mental Health Act. He arrived in Wotton Lawn in 2012 but was due to be moved to Ty Catrin Hospital in Cardiff on the day he killed Ms Wall. Speaking after the sentencing, Det Ch Insp Steve Porter said: \"This is a dreadful case in which a dedicated public servant turned up at her workplace only to lose her life in the most brutal way. \"People who worked with Sharon say she was a very competent, hard-working healthcare assistant - her family are devastated by their loss. \"Ryan Matthews had suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and anti-social personality disorder but his condition had been managed with medication.\" Mr Clee said the trust - which is in the process of changing the search policy at the unit - was aware of Matthews' previous convictions, adding \"the clinicians were happy with his placement at that time.\" He offered his \"deepest sympathies\" to Ms Wall's family and said the incident was the most difficult thing he, and many of his colleagues, had dealt with. Our investigation] has identified some areas where we think we can learn and do additional things, and we are revising and enhancing our search procedures,\" Mr Clee said. He would not confirm specific details about Matthews' care but said it was \"common practice for individuals during their treatment programme, at times and when appropriate, to have leave.\" The Health and Safety Executive is investigating Ms Wall's death, saying its inquiry is continuing.",
        "There are thought to have been as many as 200m downloads of period tracking apps worldwide. But a leading UK medical royal college has warned that women should not rely on them as a form of contraception. And privacy campaigners say users should be wary of what data they might unwittingly be sharing when they download some apps. A search for period tracking apps will quickly bring up dozens of offerings - some with charts, others illustrated with pink tulips or lilac flowers. In the health and fitness category, period trackers come second only to apps which monitor running. Amy Worsfold, from Greenwich, south-east London, has used different trackers for three years. She is a soprano opera singer. Amy told me: \"When you are starting your period or you're pre-menstrual, the hormones that rush around your body affect your larynx in ways that are detrimental to your singing voice. \"I use the app to avoid auditions, premieres or really important performances on those days if I can.\" She plots and predicts her cycle on her smartphone. The app also helps her identify connections with changes in her emotions, eating habits and headaches. Amy added: \"Being able to chart what happens to you and how you uniquely respond to your cycle is a great way of taking ownership of something that really sucks - but is completely necessary.\" Sometimes women download period trackers to monitor their fertility. But the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has warned they should not be used as a form of contraception. Only one such app on the market has been independently evaluated for effectiveness in this area. Generally, they are not classed as medical devices, which would involve stricter regulation. Ida Tin is the Berlin-based Danish entrepreneur behind an app called Clue. Around 10 of her market is in the UK. She said: \"I wanted to develop the next generation of technology for family planning - and I do believe we'll get there. But we're not there yet.\" Women in Mexico and Brazil have recently shown huge interest in Clue, possibly because of fears about getting pregnant during the Zika virus outbreak. Ida Tin is interested in how anonymised user data from her free app can be used for the greater good. To this end, she is collaborating with medical researchers at Oxford University. She has built her business on a responsible approach. She added: \"The app is a very powerful tool. I can't do what our users want me to do unless I use their data. \"I appreciate I'm asking people for a lot of trust in me, but a lot of companies [in the same line of work as mine] don't honour that trust.\" Some apps which are more firmly pointed at conception have a clear value to advertisers - as a woman planning a baby is a potential market for prams, clothing and many other purchases. Sam Smith is a privacy campaigner at medConfidential. He said: \"For all medical apps, but especially for conception apps, there needs to be a source people can trust that's independent and says this app is safe for you. \"You can read the terms and conditions - and legally you are required to. But everybody knows that nobody does.\" He sees the lack of regulation, or even official recommendation, as a market failure in this area. His advice is that if an app is free, consider whether you are paying for it in effect by giving away your data - and investigate where it might be going.",

        "Pte Cheryl James, 18, from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a bullet wound to her head in Surrey in 1995. Her parents said a dispute over the ballistics evidence could only be resolved if her body is exhumed. Coroner Brian Barker QC said he would wait for a doctor's report before he made the decision. He told the pre-inquest review at Woking Coroner's Court that exhumation was a \"difficult and unusual\" step. Alison Foster QC, representing Pte James' family, said her relatives were \"really dismayed to be at this point today.\" \"From our standpoint, an exhumation would be necessary for you to carry out a full and proper inquiry.\" Bullet fragments in Pte James' body were yellow, while the SA80 rifle she was armed with used red bullets, Ms Foster said. \"There is no actual evidence that it was an SA80 that caused the bullet wound to Cheryl,\" she added. The coroner said the full inquest on 1 February would consider whether there were \"shortcomings\" with the barracks's policies on sexual behaviour, supervision of young females, drugs, alcohol and accommodation. Another pre-inquest hearing is to held on 10 September. Pte James was one of four soldiers found dead at Deepcut, in Camberley, between 1995 and 2002. Surrey Police's request that her inquest should be heard alongside fresh inquests into the deaths of Privates Sean Benton, Geoff Gray and James Collinson was turned down. A spokeswoman for the force said: Surrey Police] has now completed the review of disclosure documents relating to Pte James.\" She said arrangements for the inquest were a matter for the coroner. \"Surrey Police is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into circumstances surrounding the death of Pte James and our thoughts remain with her family.\"",
        "Georgia says Russian troops installed signs marking the \"state border\" of the breakaway region of South Ossetia further inside Georgian territory. The move has left a small portion of the Baku-Supsa oil pipeline under Russia's effective control. Russia has brushed off accusations about its role. Its troops have been patrolling the administrative border since the 2008 Russian-Georgian war over South Ossetia. An EU foreign policy spokesperson said the installation of new signposts \"had led to tension in the area, with potentially negative effects on the local population, their livelihood and freedom of movement.\" \"Steps that could be perceived as provocative must be avoided,\" the office of EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement. \"The EU reaffirms its full support for Georgia's territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.\" Reports say markers have been placed at least 300m (980ft) further south into Georgian territory. The new border is now just 500m away from Georgia's main highway linking the Black Sea to Azerbaijan. On Tuesday Georgian Foreign Minister Tamar Beruchashvili condemned the border move as a continuation of \"creeping Russian annexation.\" It leaves a 1.6km segment of a BP-operated Baku-Supsa pipeline outside Georgia's territory. However, Georgia's Energy Minister, Kakha Kaladze, and BP spokesperson Tamila Chantladze say BP has not had access to that section of pipeline since the 2008 war. Ms Chantladze stressed that the pipeline was operating as normal. Meanwhile a flag erected by Georgian protesters near the village of Khurvaleti, just south of the dividing line, has been removed by guards on the South Ossetian side, Georgia's Rustavi-2 TV channel reported on Thursday. In August 2008, tensions between Georgia and Russia escalated into a full-blown military conflict when Georgia tried to retake South Ossetia after a series of lower-level clashes with Russian-backed rebels. In the aftermath of the war, South Ossetia declared independence from Georgia and was recognised by Russia, although only a few other countries followed suit. In April 2009, Russia bolstered its position in South Ossetia by signing a five-year agreement to take formal control of its frontiers with Georgia proper. There have been long-standing concerns that tensions over Russia's influence in the region could have an impact on Georgia's strategic infrastructure.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device Last season's Premier League champions are fighting relegation and were beaten in the FA Cup by League One side Millwall, who had a player sent off. Leicester, with one win in eight games, face a Champions League last-16 first-leg trip to Sevilla on Wednesday. \"I want to speak again with the players and say we have to fight every match,\" Ranieri said. \"I need the soldiers, I need the gladiators, because Millwall, with 10 players, showed they are fantastic gladiators.\" Millwall won with a last-minute goal from Shaun Cummings, despite playing for most of the second half with 10 men after Jake Cooper was dismissed. With the visit to Sevilla and a Premier League home match against Liverpool to come, Leicester made 10 changes, but Ranieri still expected better from the players he selected at The Den. \"It is strange because last season we won like this, by being more determined than the opponent and playing with more heart than the opponent,\" he said. \"We could also lose but we would fight every match. I want to see this, the fight until the end. \"This defeat could be good for us because when you lose against a team who fights, you have to say well done to them but why did we lose?\" Leicester have not won an away match in the Premier League all season, and are just one point above the relegation zone. They are in danger of becoming only the second defending English champions to be relegated, after Manchester City went down in 1938.

        "Customers who pay via direct debit often receive bills based on estimated meter readings. When an actual reading is taken, the company \"back-bills\" the customer for any shortfall between payments and the energy used. Citizens Advice says that the bills hit thousands of pounds in some cases. Its research last year showed that as many as 2.1 million consumers a year receive some sort of catch up bill, at an average of PS206. In 2007, energy suppliers signed a voluntary commitment promising not to back-bill domestic customers for energy used more than 12 months previously, if the supplier was at fault. The expansion of the market has led to concerns that some are not keeping to this agreement, and regulator Ofgem wants to write it into the rules by the winter. \"We expect suppliers to put their customers first, which is why we are proposing a new enforceable rule to provide this protection,\" said Rachel Fletcher, senior partner at Ofgem. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"Shock gas and electricity bills can throw people's finances into disarray. \"We helped one person who received a bill for over PS3,000 after their energy company stopped taking their direct debit payment but didn't tell the customer. The firm refused to apply the 12 month back-bill limit, leaving the customer to pay the full bill. \"We've long been calling on the regulator to introduce a mandatory time limit for back bills instead of relying on voluntary action, which suppliers have refused to apply in some cases.\" The regulator is planning to reduce the back bill time limit when more accurate smart meters become the norm in homes.

Hull could not afford to lose after Swansea had opened a four-point gap with a 2-0 win at Sunderland. Swansea's survival marks a remarkable turnaround in fortunes under Paul Clement. Clement, Swansea's third manager of the season after Bob Bradley and Franceso Guidolin, took over a side in January that was bottom with only 12 points from 19 game. The former Derby County manager's arrival at the Liberty Stadium saw an initial revival with Swansea winning three of his first five games in charge. But between the beginning of March and mid-April the Swans claimed only a single point in six Premier League games. Swansea's 2-0 home win over Stoke City on 22 April was the start of a three-match unbeaten run which boosted their hopes of escaping relegation.

        "That's the prospect facing parents in Knowsley on Merseyside. If that was happening in green-wellied Oxfordshire or the sharp-elbowed London boroughs there would have been a storming of the barricades. Howls of anguish would be rattling the windows of the Department for Education. There would be outrage about university places. Parents would want to know why their children had to fight for places in other authorities. There would be warnings about social mobility going into reverse and a great leap backwards. But in Knowsley the last school in the borough offering A-levels is planning to shut down its sixth form. The governing body of Halewood Academy voted last month to close the sixth form, pending a consultation that finished at the weekend. The academy says that its current sixth form is financially unviable. It says that the break-even point is 155 sixth formers - and although in 2011-12 it had 157, since then the numbers have been below this level and as such it is no longer affordable. The academy is proposing to stop taking new sixth formers from this autumn, with the assumption that pupils could travel to schools in other authorities. Many Knowsley pupils already go to schools in neighbouring authorities for their post-16 education, but it depends on such schools having places available. The local authority says that as this is an academy, they can't intervene. \"As an academy, it receives its funding direct from government and not from Knowsley council. \"Whilst we, as the local authority, do work with all our local academies to help them improve education standards, as an academy the school is ultimately accountable to the regional school commissioner, and not the local council.\" Parents have set up a protest page on Facebook, with comments about how difficult it is to get a clear answer from anyone about what is going on. \"Who is accountable? Nobody knows. Who do we get in touch with?\" says Vanessa Pointon, a parent at the school. \"This is letting down the children of this community. There are people who want to go to university, lots of kids who want to do well,\" she says. What kind of message does it send to young people to have no sixth forms offering A-levels? Knowsley already has among the lowest university entry rates in the country - and now young people are being told that none of their schools is even going to offer a single A-level. It is hard to think that since A-levels were introduced in the 1950s that there has ever been an authority where none of its schools offered the qualification. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: \"It is important that young people have the opportunity to access a good choice of A-levels wherever they live. \"For social mobility and access to Russell Group universities, this often means academic subjects like physics, chemistry, further maths and languages.\" Sir Peter said that despite funding challenges, it was \"crucial\" that \"such choices aren't curtailed.\" The Knowsley example raises questions about how a future school system could operate where all schools are autonomous academies. If school decisions are outsourced to academy chains, who will provide an overview? There will be six secondary schools in Knowsley, a mix of academies and local authority schools, and if Halewood's proposal goes ahead, none of them would offer A-levels. Academy chains can operate across many different local authorities - and what works for them as a chain might not be the same as local interests. A Department for Education spokesman said ministers would be meeting MPs in Knowsley about the proposed sixth form closure. But the department says that if the school wants to push ahead with closure it will still have to be approved by education officials. \"It must make the case to the Education Funding Agency and the regional schools commissioner that post-16 provision in the area would not be adversely affected by the closure before it can be given permission to close it.\" Does this mean that the Department for Education will be able to intervene? This is where things are far from clear. Regional schools commissioners, appointed by the government, are the officials responsible for overseeing academies. They can intervene if academies are underperforming or where their governance is weak. But can they force an academy, or academy chain, to change what it teaches or the age groups? It's a far-reaching question, because what if regional schools commissioners were allowed to intervene and decide on matters such as admissions policies? Could they subsidise a sixth form that an individual academy could not afford? Could they change how schools select or who they admit? It's a political balancing act, because if they are bystanders, they will be dismissed as pointless. If they're given powers to intervene, including in good and outstanding schools, they will be attacked as bureaucrats trampling on parents' rights. The Education Select Committee has warned of a lack of clarity about the role of the regional schools commissioner and that they risked being seen as \"undemocratic and opaque.\" They heard evidence that nine out of 10 parents did not understand what commissioners were meant to be doing. \"As we move towards a system of full academisation, the role of regional school commissioners will continue to grow and evolve,\" says the Department for Education. The government, setting out plans to compel all schools to become an academy, has called its White Paper \"Educational Excellence Everywhere.\" But parents facing the prospect that none of their local schools will allow their children to take A-levels must wonder if \"everywhere\" means somewhere else.",
        "The stormy weather made for treacherous racing on slippery roads but Team Sky's Froome survived the final descent into Morzine to maintain his overall lead. Froome's lead over Romain Bardet of four minutes five seconds will not be tested on the final stage in Paris. Stage 20 was won by Spanish Movistar rider Jon Izaguirre. He rode clear of fellow breakaway riders Jarlinson Pantano of the IAM Cycling team and 2014 Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali to win the 146km stage in four hours, six minutes and 45 seconds. Froome, who crashed on a rainy descent on Friday, was more cautious on Saturday's drop into Morzine and finished more than four minutes behind Izaguirre but only a few seconds adrift of his rivals in the overall standings. \"I still need to get the yellow jersey to Paris tomorrow but certainly the racing side is done and dusted,\" said Froome, who won the 2013 and 2015 editions of the three-week race. \"It's an amazing feeling of relief, just coming over the last line today. Thank you to all my team-mates, they've really been there for me every step of the way and I couldn't ask for more.\" Frenchman Bardet finished six seconds ahead of Froome to cement second place, while Quintana, who said he \"suffered from allergies\" during the race, will finish third. Tradition dictates that the man in the race leader's yellow jersey is not challenged during Sunday's largely processional final stage in Paris which is expected to end in a bunch sprint. The 113km route from Chantilly will start in pedestrian fashion with Froome posing for photographs with his team-mates, sipping the obligatory glass of champagne. The stage finishes with nine laps around the centre of Paris and Froome still has to race on the cobbles of the Champs-Elysees and make it across the finish line to be crowned champion for a third time. In doing so, he will become just the eighth rider to win three Tour titles, following legendary five-time winners Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, while joining Philippe Thys, Louison Bobet and Greg LeMond who have all won three. Froome is also set to become the first man since Indurain, who won his five titles consecutively from 1991, to successfully defend the title. Tour director Christian Prudhomme said it was Froome's incredible attacks on stages eight and 11 that were the stand-out moments for him. \"There was no surprise because Chris Froome won. But for me it was not the same as in previous years,\" he said. \"When he attacked in the Peyrsourde descent it was such a surprise. And he did it again when he went with Peter Sagan in Montpellier. I liked it very much. Chris Froome was very good, his opponents less good.\" Britain's Adam Yates will finish a terrific fourth overall and in possession of the white jersey as the best rider under the age of 25. The 23-year-old from Bury was second from stages seven to 12, and only lost third place to Nairo Quintana, one of the pre-race favourites, on Friday's penultimate stage in the mountains. However, his initial nine-second deficit became 19 when he was penalised 10 seconds for receiving a push from an Orica BikeExchange team-mate. That gap was extended to 21 seconds as he finished Saturday's stage behind Quintana. Yates' consolation was retaining the white jersey, which he won by two minutes and 16 seconds ahead of South Africa's Louis Meintjes. Froome knew only too well how easily a slip could have cost him dearly on the wet descents in this undulating stage, with his right knee bandaged from a fall in similar conditions on the previous day. He had also suffered road rash on his back and, with the road damp and the downhill finish looking dangerous, he was mindful to stay safely around his team-mates. Geraint Thomas, who handed over his bike to Froome on Friday to let his team leader complete the stage, did the job of guiding the yellow jersey up and over Col de Joux Plane, the final mountain of this year's Tour. All of the general classification front runners remained in the peloton with Froome, and the pace was only increased when Roman Kreuziger had leapt from 12th to second overall, causing slight concern among the podium contenders. In the end, Czech Kreuziger was unable to maintain the pace and a large breakaway was whittled down to the pairing of Jarlinson Pantano and Julian Alaphilippe, who were soon joined and passed by 2014 champion Vincenzo Nibali. Nibali, a favourite to win road race gold at the Olympics next month, was caught by Pantano and a resurgent Izaguirre, and the Basque-born rider descended impeccably to claim his first Tour de France stage win and Movistar's first of this year's Tour. \"I think my parents must have been scared watching at home,\" he said. \"I wanted to drop Nibali because I was worried about him in a sprint. Beating Nibali in a downhill is something that counts in a career.\" General classification after stage 20: 1. Chris Froome (GBTeam Sky) 86hrs 21mins 40secs 2. Romain Bardet (FraAG2R) 4mins 05secs 3.

        "It comes in a shake-up of UK military buildings and resettling of regiments. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies condemned the closure, saying there had been a barracks in Brecon since 1805, home to troops who fought the Zulus at Rorke's Drift. \"This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way,\" he said. \"The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well-loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town. \"Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history, with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century. \"This decision shows a blatant lack of respect for that history.\" Mr Davies said he was launching a petition against the decision, saying the Brecon area had some of the highest unemployment levels in Wales. He also hoped the closure would not damage the town's \"thriving\" military tourism industry. Brecon barracks has about 85 civilian staff and 90 military but it is not thought jobs are at risk. Mr Davies said he understood the nearby Sennybridge training ground and infantry school at Dering Lines would not be affected. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the Commons on Monday the reorganisation in Wales would see a specialist light infantry centre created at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan. Cawdor Barracks, Pembrokeshire - whose closure was previously announced in 2013 - will now shut in 2024, while a storage depot at Sennybridge will go in 2025. Responding for Labour, Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith, MP for Llanelli, said the ministry was \"right to restructure its estate.\" But she warned closing bases would affect the livelihoods of many people who would face \"gnawing uncertainty\" over their future.",
        "The four-month stand off between workers and management resulted in 12 full days of strike action, affecting hundreds of thousands of passengers. It was resolved on Friday after 66 of Luas drivers voted to accept a pay rise deal recommended by the Labour Court. Irish Transport Minister Shane Ross welcomed the results of the ballot. He said it was a positive outcome for the travelling public. The drivers were represented by the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU). Owen Reidy from SIPTU said the Labour Court recommendation would see drivers in line for pay increases of between 15 and 18 over the next four years. However Luas operator, Transdev Ireland, said the dispute had been difficult and damaging for the firm, its staff and its customers. Gerry Madden from Transdev told Irish state broadcaster RTE: \"We've said all along there would be no winners in this - the company hasn't won, I don't think SIPTU will be saying they've won, the customers haven't won.\"",
        "Using measurements from an infrared telescope in Hawaii, a UK and US team found evidence for temperatures as high as 1,500C - hundreds of degrees warmer than anywhere else on the planet. They suggest the hotspot is created by thunderous soundwaves \"breaking\" in the thin upper reaches of the atmosphere. The research is published in Nature. It arguably solves what planetary scientists had dubbed an \"energy crisis\" for gas giants like Jupiter: temperatures in their upper atmospheres soar much higher than can be explained by solar energy - especially given their vast distances from the Sun. If the mysterious heat were generated by local sources, like Jupiter's famous storm, then the conundrum would be solved - and these measurements are the first direct evidence of any such activity. Study co-author Dr Tom Stallard, from the University of Leicester, said this was a major step forward in a \"20-30 year odyssey\" to try and understand heat flow on Jupiter. \"Ever since Voyager, we've had measurements of the temperature at the top of Jupiter's atmosphere, and it's been hot across the whole globe - from the poles, all the way to the equator,\" he told the BBC. Jupiter's enormous, dramatic aurora can explain the heat in the polar regions, but for that warmth to reach the equator would require incredibly dramatic mixing, which modelling studies haven't been able to support. \"There's no real excuse for it to be so hot,\" said Dr James O'Donoghue from Boston University, the paper's first author. The freshly discovered spike in temperature, detected using a spectrometer at the Nasa Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, offers a solution. Several hundred km directly above the clouds of the Great Red Spot, the hotspot suggests that high-altitude heat is somehow created by the turmoil beneath. \"Several people have argued that it's likely that the heat comes from below, but the observations have never backed them up,\" Dr Stallard said. He and his colleagues don't know exactly what is causing the heat, but they have some ideas. It could be driven by great Jovian thunderclaps, rumbling upwards from the churning red clouds of the Solar System's biggest storm. \"You get some kind of acoustic event, probably thunder or something like that - or possibly other forms of sound energy - and that propagates directly upwards,\" Dr Stallard explained. \"That wave will continue going upwards until it reaches a lower-density region at the top of the atmosphere, and then it breaks and deposits all that wave energy into the top of the atmosphere, just like waves break on the shore - as the water gets thinner, it's less able to carry that wave and so it breaks and you see lots of energy.\" There is a precedent for such sound-driven warming much closer to home, according to Dr O'Donoghue. \"There is some evidence in Earth's atmosphere, above storms and above features such as mountains - the Andes mountains in fact - that there are acoustic waves emanating from them, and that they propagate up into the atmosphere and cause heating there,\" he said. The key to revealing the temperature spike was a tiny ion: H3, a hydrogen molecule (H2) with an added proton. It is incredibly reactive and consequently, short-lived and rare on Earth. But in the sparse fringe of Jupiter's outer atmosphere there is almost nothing else for it to react with. Crucially, this ion works like a glowing, long-range thermometer for scientists, if they have the right sort of telescope - such as the spectrometer at the IRTF, which gathered the relevant data in a single nine-hour window back in 2012. \"Just by measuring its light, you can find out the temperature wherever it is,\" said Dr O'Donoghue. \"And it's throughout all of the gas giant upper atmospheres - so it's essentially an in situ temperature probe.\" Further insights might come from Nasa's Juno spacecraft, now in orbit around Jupiter after its five-year trek. Dr Stallard said that telescopes around the world were trained on the gas giant to take parallel measurements - and his team had planned their observations with the mission in mind. \"We thought, this is something that we haven't addressed, and it needed addressing. We've really ramped up our studies away from the aurora. \"Juno's going to reveal magnificent levels of detail about.... what the aurora are and how they're generated. But it will be interesting to see how much it tells us about the non-auroral regions and the top of the atmosphere. \"Obviously it's been designed to look deep, and to look at the aurora at the poles, but potentially Juno could reveal a lot more.\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter",
        "The incident began on Tuesday morning when border agents encountered two men carrying backpacks five miles (8km) east of Sumas, Washington, in the US. Authorities say agents interrupted an attempt to smuggle a load of MDMA, or ecstasy, from Canada to San Francisco. Two others were arrested and accused of planning to transport the drugs. On Tuesday morning, US border agents ordered the two men they encountered near the border to halt, officials said. One of the men dropped his backpack, fired a weapon at the agents, and ran, according to a criminal complaint filed in US federal court in Washington on Wednesday. The officers took the other man, identified as Jeffrey Laviolette, into custody immediately. Canadian and US police searched for the fugitive on foot and by helicopter, putting up road blocks. Nathan Hall, a Canadian citizen, was arrested by the Abbotsford Police Department in British Columbia early on Wednesday morning. According to border patrol agents, the backpacks Mr Hall and Mr Laviolette were carrying contained a total of 58lb (26kg) of ecstasy. Also inside one backpack was a California driver's licence with the name of William Nickerson but a picture of Nathan Hall, the complaint alleges. Investigators later arrested a Bellingham, Washington woman, Kali Henifin, who they say planned to pick the two men up at the border. They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid 11,000 (PS7,270) to drive the drugs to San Francisco. Ms Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint. The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges. The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are \"a large part of our practice.\"",
        "For this has been the worst year on this, or indeed any other, commissioner's watch. As the league closes in on an annual revenue of PS16bn (25bn), expansion plans into Europe and specifically London, continue apace. And as Goodell tops up his bank balance with a yearly income in the region of PS26m (40m), the professional game of American Football is more popular and yet, some would argue, more contemptible than ever. Fifty NFL players were arrested in 2014 for a wide degree of offences - from Tennessee's Shonn Greene, who parked in a disabled parking bay, to Minnesota's Adrian Peterson, who was arrested over child abuse. There were five cases of domestic violence, including that of Baltimore's Ray Rice, who was filmed by hotel security punching his then fiancee - now wife - in a lift. Goodell himself became personally embroiled in the Rice case in an argument over what the NFL did or did not know. There was also a far-reaching report chaired by the former director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, which highlighted the fundamental mismanagement of the situation by league officials. And the bad news kept on coming for the embattled commissioner. Just 30 days into 2015, there have been four fresh player arrests, including two for domestic violence and one for rape. Elsewhere, it is a sorry tale: Yet despite all this mayhem and chaos the NFL, as a product, is flourishing. The moral outrage surrounding the cases of Rice and Peterson calmed down fairly quickly and audiences flocked yet again to stadiums around the country. More than 17m attended the 256 regular season games, the highest figure since 2008, while television audiences hit record highs. Media playback is not supported on this device While youth participation figures are down over concerns surrounding long-term brain damage caused by concussion, NFL fans are embracing the game like never before, both within the United States and globally. The annual Harris Report, which tracks the popularity of American sports, says the NFL is still number one by a huge margin - double the popularity of Major League Baseball and College Football. A report released this week by the sports market research group Repucom also makes some interesting claims, notably that: Most of the television networks that broadcast the NFL had audiences tuning in in greater numbers than in 2013, while the figures for both Thursday and Monday Night Football were up significantly. More than 47m people watched the NFL's annual College Draft, yet not one pass was thrown or one tackle made. There were also 9.6m tweets about the event across its three days. Nielsen, who gather audience ratings in the US, reported extremely strong numbers for the very first 9.30am EST kick-off between Detroit and Atlanta in London, so much so that the NFL will repeat the experiment next season. Although some fans showed their disdain for Rice, Peterson and others arrested last year by returning their replica shirts, many still turned up wearing Rice's number 27 jersey and Peterson's number 28 long after their cases made the national press. Despite everything, the NFL remains America's game. So why the appeal in the face of growing off-field problems? Simply put, the NFL is full of great stories, exceptional games and, most importantly, great players. The college version of the game is flourishing as well. Elsewhere in America, the other two major professional leagues - the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB) - have suffered with falling television ratings and general popularity over the past few years. Baseball's lack of true star power means it has fallen out of the national conversation, arguably since 1998 and the infamous home-run record chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who have subsequently become embroiled in steroid controversies. The names of baseball's 2014 All Stars, such as Chase Utley, Nelson Cruz and Paul Goldschmidt, do not possess the same pulling power as football stars such as JJ Watt, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers or Calvin Johnson. Baseball simply is not cool anymore and the appeal for the game has become as much regional as it is national. Jonathan Mahler wrote in the New York Times recently that: \"Baseball has never been healthier\" - in terms of attendance, revenue, and, unlike the NFL and NBA, freedom from labour strife. \"So why does it feel so irrelevant?\" With each team playing 162 games a season, baseball fans tend to watch their own players in action rather than those they have no vested interest in. That is not the case for the NFL. Almost 19m watched the Dallas Cowboys take on the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football. The NBA has also suffered in the post-Michael Jordan years, with falling attendances and viewing figures. However basketball has been rescued somewhat by the LeBron James effect, while the game, with its ongoing connection with hip hop culture, continues to grow with a younger audience. Along with the phenomenon that is College Basketball's March Madness, it remains a popular sport in America, but continues to be dwarfed by the NFL. The NBA is, according to the Harris Report, America's sixth most popular sport but is struggling with the increase in popularity of soccer and a resurgence in appreciation for ice hockey. It would also be foolish to think that the NFL is the only organisation with off-field problems. Baseball continues to move from one steroid scandal to another, while the NBA has witnessed its own fair share of domestic violence, domestic assault, battery and driving under the influence cases. The NFL is a runaway success train that shows no sign of halting. And while the on-field product remains so good, the off-field issues will be nothing more than a distraction. Green Bay Packers fan Zoe Lake is representative of millions: \"Football has always been a part of my life. As a football fan and a woman, I believe the NFL needs to take a good, hard look at the way it has handled the epidemic of violence that has rocked the league and the nation. \"But recent events will not keep me from tuning in to catch my Packers. Let's not forget: It is only a small number of NFL players who have committed violent acts against women and children.\" In April's Draft, commissioner Goodell will welcome University of Oklahoma wide receiver Dorial Green Beckham into the professional ranks, potentially in the first round. Multiple drug arrests and a dismissal from the University of Missouri for allegedly forcing open an apartment door and pushing an 18-year-old woman down a flight of stairs will not stop him being given every opportunity to succeed on the field. Even if he transgresses again, it will be just another problem for America's most popular sport. But a problem it will overcome, have no doubt.",

        "\"Welcome to Canada - honeymoon capital of the Commonwealth,\" David Johnston said before crowds at Government House. Prince William, who began his address in French, Canada's official language alongside English, said he and his wife had had a \"longing\" to visit together. The duke and duchess earlier visited Canada's National War Memorial. The couple will be staying at Government House - also known as Rideau Hall - while in Ottawa. Prime Minister Stephen Harper spoke after the governor general, saying: \"Your journey across our fair Dominion marks the beginning of your journey into the hearts of Canadians. We wish you all the best on both counts. \"We are both honoured and delighted that you have chosen us for your first official tour together.\" Prince William responded: \"Merci beaucoup, Votre Excellence et Monsieur le Premier Ministre, pour votre accueil chaleureux.\" This was translated live on Canadian television as: \"Thank you very much Your Excellency and Prime Minister for your warm welcome.\" The duke continued: \"Catherine and I are so delighted to be here in Canada. By Peter HuntBBC royal correspondent They are the British and, indeed, the Canadian monarchy's future. The enthusiastic, large crowds were keen to catch a glimpse of their future king and queen - this in a country where, according to a recent opinion poll, almost half of its citizens think the monarchy \"is a relic of a colonial past that has no place in Canada today.\" The dissenters weren't in evidence today. The streets were filled by the dedicated and the curious. They saw a much talked about \"fresh and modern\" royal couple carry out a tried and tested programme of engagements, including a speech by Prince William in English and French. He'll be partially bilingual for the next nine days as he tours a country which has had both French and British monarchs. More from Peter Hunt \"Instilled in us by our parents and grandparents, who love this country, we have been looking forward to this moment for a very long time - and before we were married, we both had a longing to come here together. \"The geography of Canada is unsurpassed and is famous for being matched only by the hospitality of its people.\" Switching to French again, Prince William joked: \"It will improve as we go along.\" The royal couple later attended a barbecue hosted by Mr Johnston, who acts as the Queen's official representative in Canada. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth and Queen Elizabeth II, Prince William's grandmother, is its head of state. At the war memorial earlier, Prince William laid a wreath and his wife Kate placed a bouquet of flowers. They split up to greet some 3,000 well-wishers. Before their walkabout fans could be heard chanting: \"We love you Kate,\" but there were also screams for the duke. Alexandra Anghel, 18, from Ottawa waited five hours to see the royal couple. She said the duchess seemed \"down to earth.\" \"It was a surreal moment to meet her, someone I never thought I would ever meet and there she was in front of me. William's lineage is amazing, he's literally walking history - I can't believe I saw walking history.\" The duke and duchess, who married in April, will visit seven Canadian cities on their nine-day visit, before heading to the US. On Friday, they will celebrate Canada's national day. The pair will also visit Quebec, Prince Edward Island, where they are to participate in a dragon boat race, and Calgary. In Calgary they will open the Calgary Stampede - an annual rodeo and festival dubbed the \"greatest outdoor show on Earth.\" Canada has created a new royal flag for the visit, which features three maple leaves, from Canada's national tree, at its base. The flag flew from the cockpit of the jet carrying the royal couple when it touched down from the UK on Thursday afternoon local time. It will also fly from their cars and buildings they are visiting or staying in. Map of tour highlights The visit will be closely followed by the media, with nearly 1,400 journalists - including about 100 from Britain - accredited to cover the visit. The Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly packed up to 40 different outfits for the tour. She left London wearing a dress by French designer Roland Mouret and a blazer by Canadian label Smythe les Vestes and changed into a navy lace dress by Erdem Moralioglu during the flight to Ottawa. Mosha Lundstrom Halbert, associate fashion news editor at Canadian fashion magazine Flare, said Kate's choice of clothing was symbolic. \"It's very exciting,\" she said. \"To me, Erdem really represents the crossover between British and Canada fashion. He's really established in the UK but Canada is where he was born and raised.\" BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt says Canada is a safe first visit for a royal spreading her new wings, while US residents continue to be fascinated by Britain's royalty. The cost of the visit to the Canadian government, not including security, is estimated to be 1.4 million Canadian dollars (PS958,580). A poll commissioned by the Toronto Star newspaper found that more than half the 18 to 34 year-olds questioned about the visit were indifferent about the trip. The duke and duchess will travel to the US state of California for two days from 8 July, attending a black-tie Bafta reception and dinner in Los Angeles on 9 July. Prince William is Bafta's president.",
        "The claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by Mighty, a US-based environmental lobby group. Mighty also accuses Olam and its main stakeholder, Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek, of turning a blind eye to these practices. Both companies reject the allegations. Singapore and Malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by slash-and-burn practices by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia. Indonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil, pulp and paper plantations in the Riau province in East Sumatra, South Sumatra, and parts of Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo. Singapore-based Olam has confirmed that it buys 99 of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry, it says it accounts for less than 1 of the global market. Mighty's report says Olam and Temask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires. It also says Olam created a \"secretive market for rogue palm oil companies\" that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources. But Olam chief executive Sunny Verghese told the BBC that the firm had a \"very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning, so it's a'no burn-no peat-no deforestation' compliance policy.\" The company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday, having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so. Mr Verghese said he believed the firm's current suppliers all met Olam's strict requirements, but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete. He added that producers who do not comply with the company's sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain. Since Temasek is the majority stake holder in Olam, Mighty's allegations could link Singapore's state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven. Temasek's investment in Olam means that \"the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world's black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze,\" the report says. Temasek has dismissed the allegations, explaining that they \"fully support no-burn policies for land clearance, and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same.\" The fund told the BBC: \"Olam's operations are properly matters for the board and management of Olam to address. \"As a matter of proper governance, Temasek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies, including Olam.\" It would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record. It is one of the world's biggest industries, projected to be worth 88bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices, as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations. Green groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally unfriendly practices, while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-wide problem, and policing third party suppliers is impossible. Activists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don't comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging, because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas. The report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon, where according to Mighty, Olam \"bulldozes rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations,\" bringing the same practices to Africa \"that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia.\" In response to the accusation that Olam is responsible for vast forest clearings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon, Olam said its private-public partnerships in the country strove to be both responsible and transparent. \"We agree with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done,\" it said. \"Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain.\"",
        "The lion, called Sylvester, crawled under an electric fence after heavy rains dislodged earth, according to a Karoo National Park spokeswoman. The park authorities intend to use a helicopter to find the lion. He was fitted with a tracking collar after he was on the loose for three weeks last year. More on this and other African news stories The park authorities said on Wednesday that they were still considering five options, only one of which was to kill the lion. Other options were to bring the lion back to the park and improve the fencing. They said the previous decision to kill Sylvester had been made prematurely. On Tuesday night South Africa National Parks tweeted that it was a difficult decision to put down the lion once they find him. The hashtag SaveSylvester has been trending in South Africa since Wednesday morning. Last June, Sylvester went on a sheep-killing spree, wandering 300km (180 miles) before he was found taking a nap by rangers and airlifted from the Nuweveld Mountains in Western Cape. On his current escape, he has already travelled at least 20km (12 miles) and killed a cow, according to AFP news agency. Meanwhile in Kenya, another lion was shot dead by a ranger on Wednesday after he escaped from a park in Nairobi. Several lions have escaped from the park in recent weeks.",
        "But could some help to make you feel better? A recent report from the American Psychological Association (APA) described it as an area that's been \"largely untapped\" and holds \"great potential.\" Recently a number of games have been developed to raise awareness of mental health conditions and treat them. Take a look at some of them. Zoe Quinn came up with Depression Quest after online games helped her to deal with late night panic attacks. \"Being able to jump into this digital world for a while, and not be stir crazy, was actually super helpful,\" says the 26-year-old from Boston, Massachusetts. Text-based Depression Quest is designed as a realistic depiction of depression, rather than a form of treatment. In her game, players are asked to make day-to-day decisions as they negotiate life with depression. They will find more positive options \"crossed out\" and unavailable to select, depending on how low their character is feeling. It's been played around 700,000 times and will soon be available to a wider audience via the Steam website. Zoe's overwhelmed by the reaction, saying: \"We have one player who said they backed off suicide having played the game, which I can't even wrap my head around.\" She accepts it's hard for mainstream games to explore these issues in the same way. \"At the end of the day they still have to make their money. Trying to sell things that are personal and emotional is very difficult,\" she says. The 3D fantasy game SPARX was developed in New Zealand and tested on hundreds of teenagers and children. Results published in the British Medical Journal showed it reduced the symptoms of depression and anxiety, and in some cases was more effective than traditional therapy. An American firm, Linked Wellness, is planning to release SPARX in the US later this year. SPARX featured in a recent report for the American Psychological Association looking at gaming and mental health. Its author, Isabela Granic, says research in this area has been \"pitifully limited\" compared to the huge amount of research into the damaging effects of playing video games. This iPhone app claims its four simple tasks can help people suffering from stress, anxiety or depression to feel better. The developers say it is based on 10 years of research but the idea of \"training the brain\" is controversial. Developer Andre Konig told Newsbeat: \"We're not saying that this is a treatment that will get completely rid of your depression - but we're saying its a platform for you to better manage your condition, and do it in your own home.\" Lindsay Dobson helps young people deal with bereavement and terminal illness at East Cheshire Hospice. She's convinced of the benefits of gaming and uses it in her sessions. \"If they're feeling angry they might come in and go onto a game that's violent. If they're feeling really boxed in they might go onto Minecraft and build a tiny room and lock themselves in it,\" she says. \"They might say they've been on Second Life or World of Warcraft and they'll talk to me about what they've been doing on there. \"We explore the character they've chosen and why they've chosen to be that character.\" Lindsay admits some parents and other therapists are still very suspicious of the benefits of playing video games. \"It's never going to replace an actual real person sat with you listening to you, but it can help,\" she adds. Nate Smith suffered from depression as a student and played a lot of console games at the time. \"There were benefits because it was a good excuse to socialise and spend time with people,\" says the 24-year-old from south London. \"But it went the other way too as it was sometimes a good excuse to stay in my room. I remember spending hours alone in my room playing games, which did me no good whatsoever.\" Nate believes a game like SPARX may have helped him at the time and described Depression Quest as \"very authentic.\" \"You can see that if you do open up to people you'll be rewarded and the depression will start to lift. \"In 30 minutes you can learn a very valuable lesson and one that affects your decision making,\" he says.

        "The 33-year-old former captain takes over from Glamorgan wicketkeeper Mark Wallace, who retired on 10 February. Mitchell, replaced by Joe Leach as captain for 2017, becomes the 14th PCA chairman since its creation in 1967. \"For Daryl to go through the process of being elected by over 400 of his peers show the regard he's held in,\" said PCA chief executive David Leatherdale. \"There were some strong candidates. But Daryl's been around for 13 or 14 years now. The players know him and what he stands for. He's trusted and respected. \"It's ironic that, having been his boss when I was chief executive of Worcestershire, he's now effectively my boss as chairman of the PCA.\" Worcestershire opener Mitchell is scheduled to be in office for the next four years - also the length of the new contract he signed at New Road in December. He won a closely-contested election ahead of four other candidates - Durham's former England fast bowler Graham Onions, Leicestershire opening batsman Paul Horton, Somerset middle-order batsman James Hildreth and Northamptonshire all-rounder Steven Crook. Subject to approval at the PCA's AGM on 21 February, Mitchell will be the third Worcestershire captain to fulfil the role, following Tim Curtis (1989-96) and Vikram Solanki (2009-13). \"It's well known now that I wanted to continue as captain,\" Mitchell told BBC Sport. \"I'm not going to lie. It was difficult for me in October but as soon as I made the decision to sign the new contract, that drew a line in the sand. \"Standing for election for this is something I'd have done anyway. I like being busy. But, looking back now, with a bit of water under the bridge, maybe not being captain as well will relieve a little bit of pressure and give me more time to focus on my batting next season. \"It's great to have this new role but I've still got be focused. And it might prove a blessing in disguise in that way.\" The other 10 cricketers to have held the role of PCA chairman are Roger Prideaux (1967-68), Jack Bannister (1968-70), Mike Edwards (1970-73), Peter Walker (1973-75), David Brown (1975-80), Chris Balderstone (1980-84), Geoff Cook (1984-89), Matthew Fleming , Martyn Ball (2003-07) and Dougie Brown (2007-09).",
        "At the Unite Scotland union's conference in Clydebank, Ms Dugdale accused the Scottish government of making cuts to schools and social care. Also speaking, UK Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn pledged that a future Labour government would repeal the Trade Union Bill. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be making a speech to delegates on Sunday. Ms Dugdale told the conference Scotland could not be a \"fairer, more prosperous country\" while councils were being \"starved of the resources they need.\" She said: \"We cannot build a better life for those children when their parents are amongst the thousands of local government workers who have lost their jobs or the 15,000 more who Cosla say could go as a result of John Swinney's PS500m cut to our councils. \"We should be cutting the gap between the richest and the rest, not the budget for our schools and the workers from our services. \"I am calling on all trade unionists to join Scottish Labour and speak with one voice to say these SNP cuts to local councils responsible for our schools and social care just aren't acceptable.\" Mr Corbyn, who was delayed arriving in Scotland because of bad weather, said Labour was setting up a commission on workplace rights to be led by the Shadow Minister for Trade Unions, and former president of the National Union of Mineworkers, Ian Lavery MP. The Labour leader said: \"Not only will we repeal the Trade Union Bill when we get back in 2020 we will extend people's rights in the workplace - and give employees a real voice in the organisations they work for. \"That means new trade union freedoms and collective bargaining rights of course because it is only through collective representation that workers have the voice and the strength to reverse the race to the bottom in pay and conditions.\" Mr Corbyn said he was proud to be a member of a trade union and the unions would be \"central to everything we do.\" An SNP spokeswoman said: \"Kezia Dugdale should ask Jeremy Corbyn to support the SNP's calls for trade union laws to be devolved as Labour voted to leave these powers in David Cameron's hands, instead of allowing the Scottish Parliament to take a new and better approach, giving him carte blanche to undermine unions in Scotland.\" Among other issues being debated at the conference are debt, the oil industry, fracking and devolution. Meanwhile, Unite's general Secretary Len McCluskey is set to urge Labour to apologise for \"betraying\" Scotland to stem the drift towards the SNP which already claims two thirds of Unite's Scottish membership. Mr McCluskey will remind Scottish members that Unite is a Labour affiliated union and urge them to come back to Labour, in a speech on Sunday. He said: \"The ideology of New Labour effectively alienated large swathes of the Scottish working class, which manifested itself quite dramatically last May. \"Kezia has to effectively say:'Labour is under new management, we apologise for betraying you, and we will start from scratch to try and build that trust up'.\"",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device \"You're not wanted any more\" rang around Cherry Red Records Stadium in Kingston as the home supporters put their own twist on Gerrard's decision to decline a new Liverpool contract and move to the United States next summer. Liverpool's followers were only too happy to offer the conflicting view - and no wonder after their 34-year-old captain once again dragged them out of hazardous terrain to safety almost single-handed with both goals in this 2-1 FA Cup third round win. If Gerrard needed - not that he does - to build a monument to what Liverpool will miss when he goes, this was the perfect template and left the questions hanging in the air. Gerrard's departure next May has been presented by Liverpool and the player himself as the right time for the parting of the ways. This iconic captain's future would have been carefully managed had he stayed another year, with his number of performances inevitably reduced. It seems Gerrard does not want, or indeed deserve, to close out his magnificent career with a lengthy spell of bench-warming. It is tempting to use every significant Gerrard intervention as part of the case for the prosecution to accuse Liverpool of failing to do enough to keep him - and even this superb performance should be placed in the context that it was with a middling League Two team in opposition. And would he be able to sustain this level of performance and energy, especially in a more advanced role, on a weekly basis in the Premier League into next season? Valid questions but questions Liverpool's fans were prepared to set to one side on Monday. Even now, with the credits rolling on his Liverpool career, they still have no-one like Gerrard who can give them hope when it seems lost, such as against FC Basel with his late free-kick on the night they went out of the Champions League, or here against AFC Wimbledon, when he produced yet again when matters were starting to look extremely difficult. Jordan Henderson is Gerrard's successor-in-waiting as Liverpool captain but does not yet come within light years of the impact the current incumbent has either on the field or off. He is still a developing player and personality so it is actually a tough comparison, but how can he, or indeed anyone else, follow Gerrard as a leader in battle, a figure afforded total respect (perhaps even fear when it comes to opponents) off the field or as a symbol for the fans? Whether Liverpool like it or not, this debate will run and run until the day Gerrard walks out of Anfield for the final time and perhaps even beyond - it was certainly raging on Monday night. Gerrard's former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher, who feels aggrieved that the midfielder has somehow been allowed to drift away from Anfield, tweeted on his Carra23 account: \"If Gerrard was one of the new signings at 24 we'd be raving about him but we judge him at 34 against himself at his peak.\" Carragher had earlier tweeted: \"Liverpool struggled for goals this season. Their top scorer is going to the MLS next season!\" Even QPR striker Charlie Austin tweeted: \"How can Liverpool let this man go?\" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was the subject of lavish praise in Gerrard's abdication speech, with the player saying he wished he had worked under the manager a decade ago, but there is no doubt there will be questions for the club's owners and executive staff every time he affects events as he did against AFC Wimbledon. Gerrard's former Liverpool team-mate and room-mate Danny Murphy told BBC Sport on Match of the Day: \"Liverpool are very fortunate they've got Steven Gerrard as his two bits of quality have been the difference between the sides and not much else.\" And Alan Shearer added: \"There was one guy who dragged Liverpool through by the scruff of the neck. How many times have we said this over the years? It was his performance, his goals, his work-rate, his effort.\" Shearer also drew the parallel with Chelsea's decision to let Frank Lampard go, only to see him turn up at Manchester City as a danger to his old club's Premier League title chances. Gerrard has made it clear he will never play against Liverpool but Shearer added: \"I just wonder whether Chelsea look at the Frank Lampard situation and just wish that they hadn't let him go. I wonder if Liverpool will do the same.\" The bottom line is that no matter how much Liverpool look to the future, the player and inspiration they still rely on is Steven Gerrard. For that overall impact on games, his colleagues and his club, he will be impossible to replace. Liverpool's debt to Gerrard was placed in even sharper relief by the fact it allowed them to secure an FA Cup fourth round tie at home to Bolton Wanderers despite seeing the usual fault lines exposed by AFC Wimbledon. After Gerrard put Liverpool ahead in the 12th minute, there was a period of relative calm as Neil Ardley's side were subdued and the Premier League giants looked in control. It did not last long as Liverpool's defence came under pressure and, as it has done so often this season, almost instantly looked incapable of coping. Sean Rigg had already missed one good chance before he forced a save from Simon Mignolet and it was alarming to see how a routine kick from AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper James Shea created various degrees of panic and a chance that Matt Tubbs wasted. Wimbledon's equaliser from Adebayo Akinfenwa was Liverpool's defence in microcosm. Mignolet flapped hopelessly at George Francomb's corner under pressure, Mamadou Sakho bundled the ball against his own bar and amid the carnage Akinfenwa reacted first. Mignolet, only restored in goal because of an injury to his journeyman deputy Brad Jones, was taunted throughout by AFC Wimbledon fans well-versed in his problems with the ball at his feet. If Liverpool could get their hands on a goalkeeper of quality as a long-term replacement for Mignolet this month surely they will, although it could prove easier said than done. Mignolet may have to do for this season but not beyond. Rodgers works on defensive organisation and is certainly too skilled and confident a coach to bring in an outsider to assist with defence, but that vulnerability must remain a concern. As he pointed out when Arsenal scored at Anfield recently, it is not a matter of coaching or organisation when three one-on-one headers are lost in Liverpool's own penalty area. The current players simply need to be better - or replaced by better players. Much was made of the memories of the original Wimbledon FC's FA Cup Final win against Liverpool at Wembley in 1988 as the sub-plot to this occasion - and it was right that two of the real heroes of that day and the old \"Crazy Gang\" were on hand for this tie in the shape of goalkeeper and captain Dave Beasant and goalscorer Lawrie Sanchez. This, though, is a different time and a different era - as well as a different club for the fans who have helped the rebirth of AFC Wimbledon after they started the long road back in the Combined Counties League in 2002 before going through five promotions and a return to the Football League in 2011. And this FA Cup night was a credit to the way this club has been reshaped and the passion of those loyal fans. Neil Ardley's team were honest, committed and did themselves and AFC Wimbledon proud on their big night. There are still further steps for AFC Wimbledon to take, perhaps even back to their old Plough Lane home, but for now this is a good news story for everyone involved. The FA Cup provides tales to tell for all involved - not just for clubs but for the media following the progress of this wonderful competition. Sunday's tie between Yeovil Town and Manchester United involved a temporary home in the front row of The Screwfix Community Stand, where you could almost reach out and touch the action at ground level. Cut to Cherry Red Records Stadium a short walk from Norbiton Station 24 hours later and home was a specially built overflow press box in a corner of the stadium, access gained by climbing a rather shaky ladder. All good fun - especially for the unsporting AFC Wimbledon fans who subjected Her Majesty's Media to (to put it politely) to catcalls as they made an inelegant exit down the ladder before leaving to hear from Neal Ardley and Brendan Rodgers. The chants of'You don't know what you're doing\" were not entirely inaccurate but given (and taken) in good part. The FA Cup third round is still one of the great dates in English football's calendar - and anyone wishing to argue against that could not have been present at Yeovil or AFC Wimbledon.",
        "As adept at crafting concert films and documentaries as he was with thrillers, comedies and emotional family dramas, his list of credits shows him to be versatile as well as prolific. Everyone will have their favourites. Personally I have a soft spot for Something Wild, a darkly comic romance from 1986 in which Jeff Daniels realises a date with Melanie Griffith comes with a psychotic ex attached. But if you had to choose the five films that best illustrate his formidable range, you could do a lot worse than picking the following: A footnote in the life of eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes formed the basis for this early success. It riffs on the much-disputed relationship between Hughes and Melvin Dummar, a service station owner from Utah who claimed to be one of Hughes's beneficiaries after his 1976 death. It's a quirky story that enabled Demme to muse on the pitfalls of instant celebrity and the way a sudden windfall makes everyone your friend. Mary Steenburgen won an Oscar for playing Melvin's first wife, while Bo Goldman was also rewarded by the Academy for his screenplay. Few directors have captured the electricity and excitement of live performance better than Jonathan Demme. For proof, one need look no further than this film of Talking Heads in concert, shot over three nights in 1983. Featuring such hits as Psycho Killer, Burning Down the House and Once in a Lifetime, it's a perfect marriage of music, cinema and humour. The latter is provided by David Byrne's suit, which gets progressively larger, and absurder, as the film goes on. Another live performance we can enjoy again and again thanks to Demme comes in this vivid record of one of Spalding Gray's acclaimed stage monologues. Focusing on the sometime actor's involvement in 1984 film The Killing Fields, it's a piece that addresses, both comically and poetically, America's own involvement in south-east Asian affairs. Laurie Anderson's score combines with Gray's hypnotising skills as a storyteller to make a riveting hybrid. Demme wasn't the first film-maker to bring Hannibal Lecter to the screen. That honour belonged to Michael Mann and his 1986 thriller Manhunter. Lambs, though, was the one the Academy recognised, awarding it all of the \"big five\" Oscars - best picture, actor, actress, director and screenplay. The film - and Sir Anthony Hopkins' Lecter - still have the power to chill the blood with its grisly autopsy scenes and Grand Guignol atmosphere. What lingers most, though, is the psychological richness and complexity of a film that, uncommonly at the time, put a female heroine - Jodie Foster's dogged Clarice Starling - at the forefront of the action. Two years on from Lambs' Oscar sweep, Tom Hanks won the first of his two back-to-back Oscars for his role as a lawyer with HIV fighting workplace discrimination. The film did much to remove the stigma associated with Aids at the time, not least by earning more than 200m (PS156m) at the worldwide box office. \"We wanted to reach people who don't know people with Aids, who look down on people with Aids,\" Demme told Rolling Stone in 1994. \"We were calculated about it. We set out to make a movie dealing with Aids discrimination, and there it is.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email .",
        "It follows the discovery of 115 people locked inside three small houses in Edinburg, close to the Mexican border. Police were alerted by a call made from inside one of the houses. The property was found to have padlocks and chains on the outside. People found inside said they had not had any food or water for three days, and some required hospital treatment. Oscar Trevino, an Edinburg police spokesman, told the BBC that it was clear the people in the properties were being held against their will. \"There was no way that they could leave because the doors were secured with burglar bars and were locked from the outside.\" He said officers had to use bolt cutters to free those inside. The imprisoned people came from several different countries in south and central America. One man told officers that they had been driven to the houses from the Rio Grande river, which marks the border between Texas and Mexico. He said they had been threatened with death if they did not remain quiet.",
        "Christian Englander will now face trial, with jury selection scheduled for 23 September, Assistant District Attorney Anastasia Martin said. Each charge carries a maximum jail term of six months and a possible 500 fine. Police said Englander had acknowledged throwing the peel after he was offended by jokes Chappelle made about a friend. \"If I can, I would like to avoid a trial,\" Englander said on Monday, following a brief hearing before Judge Donita Sena in the magistrates' court. \"I'm not afraid of the end result, but it's a waste of human resources.\" There are \"real criminals out there that they can try. If there is a plea offering, I'll take it,\" Englander added. The case has attracted attention after Chappelle said throwing a banana peel was a racist act. On Monday, Englander, who is white, said that after the police apprehended him on 30 March, Chappelle came to the police station to speak to him. According to Englander, Chappelle asked him: \"Don't you know bananas are racist?\" Englander said he told Chappelle, 41, that he did not agree. Lieutenant Andrea Dobyns of the Santa Fe Police Department confirmed that Chappelle attended the police station that night to talk to Englander.",

        "Mr Houchen beat Labour's Sue Jeffrey by a little over 2,000 votes after second preference votes were counted. Liberal Democrat Chris Foote Wood was third and UKIP's John Tennant finished last. Mr Houchen will have a budget of PS15m a year. In another result, Labour retained control of Durham County Council despite losing 20 seats. The party won 94 seats in the 2013 election and that has now fallen to 74. Independent candidates have the second highest number of seats (28) followed by Liberal Democrats (14) and Conservatives (10). Council leader Simon Henig said he was \"very pleased\" to have retained a majority in a \"challenging\" election. As Tees Valley mayor, Mr Houchen will head the Tees Valley Combined Authority, made up of Darlington, Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough and Stockton councils. After the declaration at Thornaby Pavilion, Mr Houchen said: \"What we have seen in recent years is fantastic trends towards the Conservatives across the Tees Valley and today is, I believe, a tipping point. \"We have seen a political earthquake that's happening right here for the Conservatives across the North East. \"It's the first time anybody would expect a Conservative mayor for the Tees Valley and it is the start of five genuine target seats for the Conservatives in the upcoming general election, and I genuinely believe this is a starting point for turning the Tees Valley blue.\" This is a sensational vote for the Conservatives. Beating Labour in the first round, we perhaps thought Labour might claw it back with second preference votes. They were counted then but actually Conservatives pulled further ahead and Ben Houchen beat Sue Jeffrey the Labour candidate in a runoff to become the Tees Valley mayor. He has now got to deliver on certain promises, one of which is to take control of Durham Tees Valley Airport and try to revive its fortunes. He talked about turning the Tees Valley blue in the general election in just over a month's time and that will be the Conservative focus now.",
        "The inquiry was told Harry Clarke, 58, had been unconscious at the wheel of a bus in 2010 and during the bin lorry crash in December last year. Expert witness Dr Ronald Neville told the inquiry doctors did not note differing accounts of the 2010 episode. Mr Clarke told his GP he had fainted in the work canteen at First Bus. But the First Bus doctor was aware this happened while he was at the wheel of the bus. Six people died and 15 others were injured when the Glasgow City Council bin lorry veered out of control on Queen Street before crashing into the Millennium Hotel in George Square in December 2014. The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) at Glasgow Sheriff Court is examining Mr Clarke's health, the condition of the lorry and the route taken. The court had previously heard that following the 2010 blackout when he was a bus driver, Mr Clarke was examined by Dr Kenneth Lyons, the medical advisor to First Bus. Dr Lyons subsequently sent a letter to Mr Clarke's own GP, which described how his loss of consciousness took place on a stationary bus and asked for further advice. Mr Clarke's GP, Dr Gerard McKaig, told the inquiry that the driver had said to him that he had fainted in the First Bus canteen. After he went on annual leave, Dr Lyons received a response to his letter from a Dr John Langan, who worked at the same practice as Dr McKaig. The letter said Mr Clarke had been \"waiting for his lunch in a hot environment\" when he fainted, and the driver was \"unlikely to have another one.\" It concluded Mr Clarke was \"fit to return to work as a bus driver.\" On Tuesday, the inquiry heard a second day of evidence from Dr Neville, a GP in Dundee, who also prepares expert reports on drivers' fitness to drive. He prepared a report on Mr Clarke after the bin lorry crash. Dr Neville told the inquiry that the \"major discrepancy\" in reports about the 2010 episode should have been caught by doctors. The expert witness said the letter that came back from Mr Clarke's GP's surgery lacked the detail or thoroughness you would expect from a healthcare professional. He said the First Bus doctor should have noted the major discrepancy in the account of the 2010 blackout and he should have got in touch with the other doctor. Dr Neville said that if either doctor had noted the discrepancy in Mr Clarke's account, an inquiry into the exact facts would have resulted. Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died in the bin lorry crash. Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed. The Crown Office has already concluded that there will be no criminal prosecution over the crash, with senior lawyers deeming it a \"tragic accident.\" The inquiry continues.",
        "Two Jesse Sene-Lefao tries got the Tigers on the way after Leigh had one of three scores ruled out by the video referee, before Eden cut loose. All four of his tries were created by the potent left-side combination of Luke Gale and Michael Shenton. Jake Webster added a seventh Tigers try, their 101st league score of 2017. Since these two teams met on the opening weekend of the season, Daryl Powell's Castleford have proved to be the stand-out team in the division, and showed hallmarks of that quality to dispatch the Centurions - who have struggled since a bright start. Leigh were not disgraced by their performance and had plenty of ball but defence has been a major improvement for the Tigers, who have the best record in the division. Discipline did not help them, as Cas loanee Ben Crooks went to the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle call and the Tigers scored in his absence. However, it is Castleford's attacking menace which has caught the eye most and they were at their best, through the influential England half-back Gale in particular. Sene-Lefao took his personal tally to six for the season but Eden is now just 14 tries behind last season's Super League record-breaking winger Denny Solomona with 14 games of the season left to play. Castleford coach Daryl Powell: \"I thought we were superb in the second 20 minutes of the first half. We defended well all the way through but made too many errors when we got in attacking positions early on. \"To nil a team is very difficult to do and we showed some last-ditch stuff there which shows the character in the team. We have done that twice now this season and they are big results for us. \"I thought our attitude was outstanding, given we've just had the second ridiculous short turnaround this season. It's crazy how that has been put together. \"The boys have put a lot of emphasis on defence this year and they were delighted to keep a clean sheet.\" Leigh: McNally; Dawson, Crooks, Fleming, Brown; Reynolds, Drinkwater; Acton, Hood, Burr, Paterson, Vea, Stewart.

        "With colleagues in BBC News, we have been tracking where the party leaders are going. And, frankly, the Conservative game plan seems extremely straightforward. To illustrate that, here is a chart: each block represents a Tory-facing Labour seat (in red) or a Labour-facing Tory seat (in blue). And each stack of blocks tells you how many seats each party gains if they improve their polling, in 2 percentage points increments. So, for example, the red stack left of the centre line is nine high. If the Tories were to uniformly poll 2 percentage points higher on election day than they did in 2015 relative to Labour, they would take nine seats. Conversely, a two-point improvement for Labour relative to the Tories would yield 12 seats. Of course, at the moment, the Conservatives are well ahead of where they were at the last general election, while Labour are doing much the same. Political scientist Dr Chris Hanretty from the University of East Anglia estimates the likely result is for the Conservatives to take seats, roughly as follows. That dark blue zone is the area where, according to Dr Hanretty's maths, about 70 seats are now likely to go Conservative, having been Labour seats in 2015. Those seats - and seats like them - are the front line in this election. We can overlay that graph with black blocks that show the sort of places where Theresa May has visited. What does this mean? Well, Mrs May is spending the bulk of her time in front line seats. She made one visit to Maidenhead, her own seat, which is the block to the far right. But it is very clear where she thinks the fight is - and it is roughly where Dr Hanretty thinks it is. There is, though, a subtler game being played. We do not talk much about the importance to campaigns of getting on local TV and radio bulletins, which have huge audiences and credibility. But parties obsess over it. More people tune into BBC One's regional news bulletins at 6:30pm than the national news at 6pm. You could divide the country into BBC radio or TV regions to illustrate this. But here, for example, are the number of days in which Mrs May has made a visit to each ITV region or sub-region. That emphasis on the West Midlands and Yorkshire is telling: 28 of the seats that Dr Hanretty currently expects to flip are in those two areas. This way of thinking may also clarify things for some activists who were puzzled as to why Theresa May went campaigning in rural Aberdeenshire. It put her into STV North, which covers a few target seats currently held by the SNP. And note, she only has one region yet to reach. Mr Corbyn's visits, though, are harder to make sense of. Reproducing the same charts, you can see few of his visits have been into the seats that polling currently implies will change hands. On this chart, the black blocks represent his campaign trips. Of the battleground seats, Mr Corbyn has been to three. Mr Corbyn is holding events in safe Labour seats and in Tory seats which, the polls suggest, are very unlikely to be won. But he is not doing much in the zone in between, where seats are most likely to change hands. Why? The simplest answer is that Mr Corbyn's team simply think the polls are wrong. They think the Tory seats he's going to are going to go red - and the Tories are wasting their time fighting in seats that will stay with Labour. We will see. A less simple answer is that his campaign has chosen not to take him to the front line. Several Labour MPs in those seats have made it clear that they think his presence will not help them persuade swing voters. This pattern has been noticed by some of his critics who wonder if this is about life after 8 June. Mr Corbyn, some Labour insiders say, is visiting safe seats where Labour activists are over-represented to bolster his place in the next Labour leadership race. Two Labour MPs suggested to me he is trying to maximise the popular Labour vote to help bolster his argument for staying on in the event of a defeat. Broadcasting, though, is a factor to consider in all this. ITV audiences in target seats may not notice exactly where he is. Mr Corbyn has been getting into the TV regions - and it is possible he is generating better pictures, addressing big crowds, by visiting safer Labour seats. Whatever the rationale, the only thing that's utterly clear is that Mrs May and Mr Corbyn aren't fighting this election in the same way. Additional work by Jack Evans and Daniel Dunford",
        "So what happens next? If the politicians are not in a position to produce a budget, the civil service could take over. Legislation allows the permanent secretary in the Department of Finance to take control if a budget act has not been passed at least three working days before the end of the financial year. The official can access a sum of money not exceeding 75 of this year's budget and direct how it is spent. If we get to the end of July and there is still no deal that official then has the right to spend an amount equivalent to 95 of this year's budget. So that implies significant in-year cuts at Stormont unless a budget is produced by either an Executive or a direct rule minister. This contingency plan was mooted during a previous budget crisis but was described by the then Finance Minister Arlene Foster as \"dramatic and draconian.\" The current finance minister, Mairtin A\" Muilleoir, has emphasised that the legislation means \"monies will continue to flow.\" However the TUV leader Jim Allister, who is also a senior barrister, said his reading of the law suggests it will not be so straightforward. He believes that the Executive must at least issue a draft budget before the permanent secretary is empowered to take control. Short of that, he thinks it could require emergency amending legislation at Westminster. Whoever is correct, the budget uncertainty will have an impact.

        "The drones will be used to scan and assess Easyjet planes and report damage back to engineers. The flying robots are being developed by a team that includes experts from the University of Bristol. Easyjet is also developing virtual reality video technology. In addition, Easyjet wants apps to help with maintenance, and the airline is fitting \"paperless plane\" technology. Durable laptop computers will replace printed navigational charts in planes. \"We have examined and assessed cutting edge technology across many different industries and are now applying a range of new technologies to the aviation sector for the first time to help us run our fleet of aircraft more effectively, efficiently and safely,\" said chief executive Carolyn McCall. Easyjet plans to test the drones within coming months. \"Aircraft inspection is a great application for drones,\" said Dr Arthur Richards, head of aerial robotics at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory. \"Coupled with smart navigation and computer vision, they can get accurate data from really awkward places.\" The flying robots are being developed by Bristol Robotics Laboratory, a collaboration between University of Bristol and the University of West England. Drone company Coptercraft and software company Measurement Solutions are also involved in the project. The drones are fitted with high definition video cameras, but can also use lasers to scan the outside of the aircraft, Easyjet head of engineering Ian Davies told the BBC. \"We could zoom [the laser scanner] up and down the aircraft and map the surface,\" he said. \"If we've mapped the aeroplane we can have a complete history of its full life.\" He added that it is safer to have drones working at height than humans having to go up on a rig. One of the main challenges for the drones is how to get them to work outside in windy conditions, Mr Richards said. The drones are built to be light in weight, but that can make them vulnerable to gusts of wind on an airfield. They plan to use research into how animals such as bees and birds cope with blustery weather to \"see how nature solves the same problem.\" Another challenge is to automate drone flights, he added. Easyjet is also hoping to use virtual reality to help sort out technical problems with planes that are a long way from its engineering team. At the moment engineers and pilots email pictures and call Easyjet's control centre to try to resolve issues over the phone. But Easyjet is planning to use hi-tech glasses that can relay high definition video images back to base. Engineers could be directed to do repairs by a team looking at the video stream coming from the glasses, Mr Davies said. The technology also uses \"augmented reality,\" where a computer image is superimposed on the view as seen through the glasses. For example, an engineer can compare an image of a fuselage projected onto the glasses with the actual fuselage, to see what work needs to be done. \"It's a very simple Robocop outfit people would wear,\" Mr Davies said. \"We are using the human almost like a robot.\" The airline wants to use the technology in airports such as Sharm el Sheikh and Tel Aviv. At the moment, the data is transmitted using 4G, but Easyjet is discussing options for satellite links with communications company Iridium, Mr Davies said. When choosing the type of glasses to use, Easyjet evaluated Google Glass, but found the technology \"too fragile for industrial use,\" he added. There has been a surge in interest in drones in recent years, and they are being developed for a variety of uses. The United Arab Emirates wants to use small government drones to provide services, like ID-card delivery, by next year. Google bought solar-powered drone maker Titan Aerospace in April to help the firm's efforts to expand internet access. Amazon is in the process of testing drones for deliveries, and a photographic drone that uses a dog-lead as a fail-safe has been developed.",
        "The \"black box\" of the Su-24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday in front of journalists and diplomats. Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, said flight information appeared to be missing. Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet's location when it was hit. An analysis is expected to be released next week. The downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, with Moscow imposing sanctions in response. Turkey insists that the jet, from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, ignored warnings to leave its airspace. Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey's government again on Thursday, accusing it of subservience to the US and of \"creeping Islamisation.\" What we know about how the Su-24 was downed How Russia's sanctions could hit Turkey The war of words as it erupted The two countries are heavily involved in Syria but take radically different positions despite both being ostensibly opposed to the Islamic State (IS) militant group. The Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November. Both crew members ejected but the pilot was killed, apparently by militants on the ground while the navigator was rescued. A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew was also killed and a helicopter destroyed on the ground. Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and in the meantime has imposed sanctions including a ban on package holidays, which could cost Turkey billions of dollars.",
        "Elgan Varney, 33, was accused of raping Hannah Stubbs, who was a student at Keele University, in Staffordshire. The 22-year-old killed herself at her Stafford home in August 2015. Judge John Fletcher cleared Mr Varney, formerly of Newcastle-under-Lyme, of two counts of rape and one of sexual assault after the CPS offered no evidence against him. See more stories from across Stoke and Staffordshire here During the hearing at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, prosecutor Karim Khalil QC said the decision not to continue the prosecution had been taken at the \"highest level\" of the CPS. The CPS said the case had been kept under regular review and prosecutors were no longer satisfied there was a realistic prospect of conviction. Defence counsel Ann Cotcher QC told the court Mr Varney had been \"removed from his attempts at education\" at Keele because of the proceedings against him. \"This is an allegation that goes back to 2014,\" Ms Cotcher told the brief hearing. \"The defendant was interviewed, as was the complainant, in March 2015, almost exactly two years ago.\" Following the hearing, Mr Varney offered his condolences to the family of Ms Stubbs. In a statement read out by his solicitor, Hollie Alcock, Mr Varney said: \"This is not a time of celebration for me - quite simply, I should never have been charged and put through this horrendous ordeal.\" He also called for a change in the law to provide anonymity to those charged with but not convicted of sexual offences. In a statement, Ms Stubbs' parents, Paul and Mandy Stubbs, said: \"We don't want what happened to Hannah to define her life or our memory of the kind and loving person that she was.\" An inquest recorded a narrative verdict that she had taken her own life following post-traumatic stress. A spokesman for the university said: \"Based on today's outcome, we will be in conversation with Mr Varney over the coming weeks. \"As is standard practice, any such discussion will be confidential between the university and the student.\"",
        "The introduction of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, however, means that even if she wants to, Mrs May might not find it so easy. The Act was introduced after the 2010 election to bind together the two parts of the new coalition government. The discretion of prime ministers to pick the timing of elections was removed and the dates fixed five years apart - we are next due one on Thursday 7 May 2020. The Act provides two mechanisms by which an early election could be triggered, which are: Taking each in turn, the government does not have the numbers on its own to achieve a two-thirds majority so any vote would depend on what the other parties do. Jeremy Corbyn has warned the Labour Party to prepare for an election next year and Newsnight reported in September that he planned to instruct his MPs to vote in favour of an early election if the government wanted to call one (although that has not been confirmed). Latest polls suggest that supporting an early election would be a mistake for Labour. It is unlikely the Scottish National Party would come to the government's assistance in bringing about an early election. Looking at the second mechanism, if other parties do not support an early election it would be unprecedented in British politics for a government to bring about its own downfall (though such engineering is not unknown elsewhere) and the government voting no confidence in itself could be a risky strategy. More likely is that the Fixed Term Parliaments Act could be repealed or amended, to require, for example, a simple majority of MPs in favour of an early election, though the House of Lords may have something to say about this. An amendment to existing legislation seems more straightforward than trying to reintroduce the prerogative power to call elections. In short, the calling of an early election would require either a change in the law, or some unusual parliamentary gymnastics.",
        "The Czech-born American helped Murray win Olympic gold, the US Open and Wimbledon before they parted in March. Lendl, 54, could not commit to the amount of travelling required but sees himself returning at some stage. \"I've had a lot of enquiries,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Eventually, when the time and situation are right, I enjoyed it enough that I will do it again.\" Lendl, a former world number one and eight-time Grand Slam champion, admitted the travelling issue was the main drawback to taking up another role. \"There are so many things to coaching which I don't enjoy: the travel, the airports, being on the road for so long,\" he said. \"I don't like doing anything in half-measures, so in order to do it properly it takes a lot of time. That's the hardest part.\" Tomas Berdych, the world number seven from the Czech Republic, spoke last week about his wish to work with Lendl. \"I think it's something which I was thinking about, definitely,\" said Berdych. \"I think it just needs probably the right time and timing to make it happen. Let's see. I hope for the time it's going to come up. Fingers crossed.\" Lendl met Murray and his team in New York a few days before the start of the US Open, in which the Briton went on to reach the quarter-finals before losing to top seed Novak Djokovic. \"I think Andy needs to win some matches to get some confidence, that's the key there,\" said Lendl. Asked about his time with the Scot, he added: \"I enjoyed it. It obviously was difficult at times in terms of travel, which I don't like doing, but I'm really glad that we got together and that Andy had the success he had.

Saturday's US Open semi-finals saw Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Michael Chang and Goran Ivanisevic in the four coaching corners. \"I don't think that it's a coincidence, I really don't,\" said Lendl. \"I always felt that one of the biggest attributes of Tony Roche coaching me for 10 years, what he was giving me was the knowledge of what it feels like to be on that Centre Court on Sunday afternoon. \"He has done all four of them, been in all four finals.

        "Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg said parts of the track in the Azerbaijani capital were \"really not looking good.\" Button added that some corners \"don't have any run-off at all.\" Rosberg hoped governing body the FIA had stuck to the safety guidelines that govern tracks, but added: \"I'm doubting it a little because of those corners.\" The main areas of concern on the new track, which joins both the new and historic old parts of the city and is expected to be the fastest street circuit in F1 history, are turns three, seven and 15 and the pit-lane entry. Button said: \"We trust in the FIA and they do a fantastic job in keeping us safe. They have improved pretty much every circuit we go to, including Monaco. \"It's just that on certain corners here, it looks as if there is not a lot of run-off. Hopefully I'm wrong.\" He added: \"It is fine as long as no-one has a failure, we will go away all happy. We just have to hope that doesn't happen.\" Button said the most critical area was turn 15, which the drivers will approach at estimated speeds of about 180mph after a long flat-out section. He said: \"There is run-off but you have to turn right to take it.\" Rosberg added: \"The track is great, the place is great. I have been welcomed very well so I'm sure all in all it will be a great success. \"But there is a bit of a concern for sure with those run-offs. That's not great. The corner before going down the hill (15) where you have a wall straight on, turn three, and then the pit entry as well. that is not fantastic.\" The pit-lane entry is towards the end of a 2.1-kilometre straight, where cars are expected to be travelling in excess of 200mph, and features a tight chicane. The area governed by the pit-lane speed limit does not start until after the chicane. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo said the pit entry \"is going to be quite cool\" because, as it is effectively part of the race track, there was \"between half-a-second and a second\" for a driver to gain in the chicane. But Rosberg countered: \"Yeah but there is also a massive accident to be had if you go a little bit more than that.\" McLaren's two-time champion Fernando Alonso, who is the race's official ambassador, played down the issue. \"There are some corners probably we will talk about,\" he said. \"Some others that we need to go on the car first and see how they feel. \"In terms of safety, the FIA ran many simulations in terms of how to make the run-off safe enough. Some of them are safe enough, some of them maybe they look small but it's always better than Monaco, for example.

        "During a visit to Birmingham on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn is expected to say a 17 increase in Carer's Allowance would help around one million people in the first year of a Labour government. Under the plan, Carer's Allowance would rise from PS62.70 to PS73.10 a week. Ministers say they will spend an extra PS2bn on social care over three years. Carer's Allowance is paid to around 6.5m people in the UK who care for older, disabled and seriously ill friends or relatives for at least 35 hours a week. Eligible carers cannot earn more than PS116 a week after tax. Mr Corbyn said he believed it \"would be a good thing to do\" to help carers, \"usually women\" who have to give up their jobs to look after elderly relatives at home. \"Caring for people is stressful,\" he told the BBC. \"In some way it's enjoyable because you want to do it, but you shouldn't be impoverished because of it. It's also lonely.\" In his speech later, the Labour leader will claim \"Britain's social care crisis was made in Downing Street by cutting PS4.6bn from council care budgets.\" \"Millions of unpaid carers have been forced to fill the gap and put under even greater pressure as a result,\" he will say. \"The care they give to the disabled, sick and elderly saves taxpayers PS132bn a year. So we believe these unsung, unpaid heroes not only deserve our praise and recognition - they deserve better financial support. \"That's why Labour is convinced it's both morally and economically right to give the Carer's Allowance a boost of PS10 a week. \"We also think it's only fair that this extra support for carers is funded by scrapping the Tory cut on inheritance tax, which will only benefit the wealthiest people in Britain. \"This will be the first step in helping to transform our social care system for the 21st century and boosting support for family carers.\" According to Labour, up-rating Carer's Allowance would cost PS538m by 202021. This would be covered by scrapping the expected PS650m cut to inheritance tax, which allows married couples to pass on estates worth PS1m free of death duties. But the Conservatives claim Labour would be unable to fund the promise to increase the allowance. Luke Hall, a Tory member of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: \"Carers make a huge contribution to society, so it's only right that we do everything we can to support the selfless work they do. \"That's why we already increased the rate of Carer's Allowance, meaning an additional PS450 a year for carers since 2010. \"Labour have already committed the money from corporation tax cuts 11 times over, so there is no way they could find the additional money for this promise. \"It's not worth the paper it's written on - just like Labour's reputation for economic management.\" The government has recently committed to spending an extra PS2bn on the social care system over the next three years and allowed local authorities to raise council tax bills in order to fund social care services.",
        "Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton was convicted of killing Jennifer Laude in a hotel room in Olongapo city, north-west of Manila, last year. Pemberton will face between six and 12 years imprisonment. The case has strained ties between the US and the Philippines, a former US colony where the Americans have a significant military presence. The marine was on leave in Olongapo on 11 October 2014, after joint military exercises with the Philippine army, when he met Ms Laude in a bar. Police said they left together and checked into a hotel, where she was found dead the next day, apparently strangled and with her head inside the hotel toilet. Pemberton had previously testified in court that he had attacked Ms Laude after he realised she was transgender, but said she was still alive when he left the room. The prosecution had argued Pemberton should be convicted of murder, but the court downgraded this to homicide. Pemberton was also ordered to pay at least 4.5 million pesos (95,350; PS63,140) to Ms Laude's family. Ms Laude's sister, Malou, told Reuters news agency: \"We expected a murder conviction but instead got homicide. We are not content with the decision.\" Pemberton will be temporarily detained in a Philippine jail until the Philippine and US governments agree on where he should be held during his prison term. The case has led to calls from left-wing groups for the Philippines to end its military agreements with the US. Under the agreement, the Philippines can prosecute US military personnel but the US retains custody over them \"from the commission of the offence until completion of all judicial proceedings,\" the Associated Press reports.",
        "Rooney, 30, played in midfield rather than as a striker and came under fire following the shock defeat by Iceland. \"He's our talisman, he's our greatest goalscorer, he's experienced and you don't want that to walk away at this stage,\" Lampard told BBC Sport. \"I would want him in the team and in the squad. He has certainly got another tournament in him.\" Rooney has scored a record 53 goals in 115 appearances for his country. The Manchester United man was made England captain in August 2014 but has come under scrutiny for a number of disappointing displays. He found the net from the penalty spot after just four minutes against Iceland but underperformed for most of the game in Nice as England went out of Euro 2016 at the last-16 stage. In the wake of the defeat, Germany legend Lothar Matthaus said it was time for Rooney to retire from international football. \"Sadly, when his team needed him, Rooney was not that leader,\" he said. \"You need someone who can provide the impetus and rhythm. I thought Rooney could take the role but, when it mattered, he wasn't able to do it.\" Media playback is not supported on this device \"I think once we reflect a bit more, Wayne will remain a big player in the squad and will help with the development of the younger players around him,\" insisted Lampard, who won 106 caps for England. However, the former Chelsea and West Ham midfielder thinks he needs to work out his best position for both club and country. Under Louis van Gaal, Rooney began to play in midfield as well as a striker but that may change now Jose Mourinho is manager of Manchester United. \"I don't believe 31 is an age where you need to change position because of being 31, said Lampard, now playing in the United States with New York City. \"I think Wayne still has the pace, the ability and the knowhow to play as a striker, but the choice will obviously be between him and his managers.\" Rooney has already said he would continue to be available for international selection. England's next game is a 2018 World Cup qualifier in Slovakia on 4 September. England should not be afraid of appointing another foreign coach as a successor to Roy Hodgson, said Lampard, who played under Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson and Italian Fabio Capello during his time with the national side. \"Ideally, as a proud Englishman, you'd love an English manager,\" he said. \"But I think, in the modern world, you have to accept that, if the options aren't there, you have to look abroad. \"It wouldn't bother me if a foreign manager took an England team forward and was successful, not at all.\" England are looking for a new manager as Englishman Hodgson quit immediately after the defeat by Iceland. Under Eriksson, England reached the quarter-finals at three successive major tournaments, while Capello led England to the 2010 World Cup and a 4-1 defeat by Germany in the second round. \"I think the best man for the job would be the starting point for picking the next manager,\" added Lampard, who would prefer a youthful boss, adding: \"Over the last 10-15 years, when I was playing, we weren't setting a new tone. \"I would look to a younger, forward-thinking manager who has a real strong idea about how he wants to play, plays good football, generates a good spirit in the team and go that way.\" But he believes it will not be a straightforward task for the Football Association. \"I can't give you the name, which is the problem, but they will have to have a confidence in the decision they make,\" said Lampard. \"They'll have to give him free reign to try to mould these good young players into a team that can fight at the top level.\"",
        "Qualification for France looks little more than a formality from a favourable group that offered England and manager Roy Hodgson the perfect rehabilitation period after their embarrassing early retreat from South America at the group stage. The thrilling victory against Slovenia in Ljubljana on Sunday made it six wins out of six in Group E and with a six-point lead and four games remaining, it gives Hodgson and England the chance to make amends for events in Brazil when they reach France, as they surely will, next summer. It was also, however, a win that exposed cracks in England's make up as well as demonstrating some of the quality they can offer in attack. England's chaotic win, which contained some excellent passages of play, was the perfect antidote to those who believe they are entirely functional under Hodgson - but much of it was the wrong sort of excitement, especially in defence. So how far have England come since the World Cup and that defeat by Italy in Manaus a year ago? And can they make a serious impact in France? On results alone, England and Hodgson are above criticism - so it seems churlish to add any rider to a perfect qualifying campaign that is unblemished and a season that has seen them go unbeaten for the first time since 1990-91. This has been, however, \"The Group of Death\" only when it comes to excitement. Once England skilfully negotiated what appeared to be the most hazardous fixture on their schedule, a 2-0 win in Switzerland in September courtesy of two goals from Danny Welbeck, the tone was set for routine qualification. Hodgson will rightly argue England can only beat what has been put in front of them, which they have, but none of the qualifying games will provide any sort of accurate measure to how they would cope when confronted with an elite power in a competitive environment. And of course comfortable qualification for last summer's World Cup counted for little when England were effectively out after two games. The bottom line is that heads would have rolled had England failed to qualify from this Euro 2016 group, with an inquiry to follow presumably, but it has been negotiated efficiently if not spectacularly. Hodgson is entitled to ask what more England could have done - but it may be that friendlies arranged between now and the Euros will actually tell us more than the qualifying campaign. There is no better plus point than an unblemished record of six from six - and there are other factors Hodgson can point to as he engenders hope and optimism ahead of Euro 2016. Hodgson often talks of his squad being young and this is true. There is a younger, fresher look to England's squad, in part because of the retirement of the likes of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard and the decision to move away from experienced players such as Glen Johnson. This feels like a new generation. Joe Hart remains one of the best goalkeepers in the world and Hodgson will look to develop young players in and around the team in the next 12 months - with an eye on talent emerging during the under-21 Euros later this month. Despite his contract impasse at Liverpool, 20-year-old Raheem Sterling will surely be a star of England's future and huge hopes remain for Everton's Ross Barkley, a wonderful talent who must rebuild after a disappointing 12 months. Jack Wilshere has been a great hope for England over the last couple of seasons. He has seen his career curtailed by injuries but he rose to the occasion in Slovenia. He was not simply the strong-running, creative Wilshere loved by Arsenal's supporters, he was a controlling influence in times of trouble and produced two spectacular strikes, his first for England on his 28th appearance. If he can stay fit and build on that next season, Hodgson will finally have the midfield gem he has been waiting to polish. And in Gareth Southgate's Under-21 squad, there are players who will be earmarked to progress at such a rate to possibly make their mark in France, particularly Tottenham striker Harry Kane, Everton's elegant defender John Stones and West Brom forward Saido Berahino. Hodgson will also hope striker Danny Ings's move to Liverpool will speed his development. Add this to the quality and experience already provided by the likes of captain Wayne Rooney and with hopes Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge may actually stay fit (a long shot admittedly) and Hodgson will feel he can head into the Euros in good heart. Watch a video of England's defensive performance here in Ljubljana. They are easy to spot. England lacked defensive leadership, organisation, lacked a leader who, according to BBC Radio 5 live pundit Martin Keown, is in the mould of his former Arsenal captain Tony Adams, a defender who takes concession of a goal personally. A crass error from Phil Jones, a foul throw-in that went unpunished but straight to a Slovenia player, led to the first goal and weakness in the air brought the second. Defence is England's soft underbelly and better teams than Slovenia will have noticed its failings here. The worry for Hodgson is that this is an old problem that remains uncured. Before leaving for the World Cup, England's defence was pinpointed as an area of potential trouble, a flaw that could be unpicked by players of the highest class. And so it proved - not so much in defeat by Italy but in the decisive loss to Uruguay, where Luis Suarez, despite not being fully fit, tormented the central defensive duo of Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka to score twice. Media playback is not supported on this device Those questions remain about England's defensive quality, where Manchester United pairing Phil Jones and Chris Smalling have failed to convince and Jagielka, despite a superb personal season at Everton, is unlikely to be the answer in France. Neither convinced in Slovenia and Jones, in particular, looks all at sea at international level. Hodgson seems obsessed with finding him a place in the team - remember the failed holding midfield experiment against Italy in Turin? - but he has rarely looked accomplished for England. This is where Stones may come in and partner Cahill, who is nowhere near as assured for England as he is at club level for Chelsea when he has John Terry alongside him for support. Stones is untested at the highest level for all of his talent while the full-back spots are up for grabs, with Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne and Everton's Leighton Baines (who suffered badly at the World Cup) likely to emerge in pole position. England's midfield may see off the lower orders in the international pecking order but is its ball retention good enough against the best? It certainly was not at the World Cup and again this qualifying campaign has not offered a firm solution. And for all those who snipe, England are still heavily reliant on the goals, inspiration and leadership of captain Rooney - too reliant given the retirement of Gerrard and Lampard. Rooney will be 30, and surely England's record goalscorer, by the time Euro 2016 starts. He has not had any significant impact on a major tournament since he burst on the scene as an Everton 18-year-old at Euro 2004 and yet it looks certain he will still be shouldering the heaviest burden of responsibility. For all those who have questioned his place in the past, England have never, ever looked better without him. It is perhaps a sign of England's lack of development that no-one has yet come forward to ease that strain on a player and personality so desperate to do well for England. No - try asking a different question. Can England make an impact at Euro 2016? Yes... if all their best players fire. It takes too much of a leap of the imagination to see England troubling the likes of Germany and Spain but they will give plenty of others a run for their money if Hodgson can somehow make all the pieces fit and prove he can inspire, and relate to, this younger group of players. In flashes, admittedly against a Slovenia side ranked 48th in the world, they showed they have quality in attack. It is elsewhere that the failings are found. There is talent within the squad that can get a result on a given day but when it comes to major tournaments England do not have enough given days. It is not as big a task as the World Cup but surely England will survive the group but questions remain about how much further they would drive into the tournament. Hard to assess. Results have been excellent but little excitement surrounds this England team under Hodgson, not helped by the standard of opposition in their Euro qualifying group and performances like the dross served up against the Republic of Ireland. There has been that move towards the next era of younger players led by the likes of Wilshere, Sterling, Barkley but they still have so far to go. Hodgson is satisfied with England's progress, saying: \"We started with a new group and we didn't know where that would lead but I've been quite pleased with what they've done so far.\" He added: \"Grieving is too strong a word but there's a process.

        "The disease can be more serious and harder to treat than conventional, human tuberculosis. The world has committed to being free of tuberculosis by 2035. But bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) say animal TB has been neglected for decades. Raw or unpasteurised milk is one of the most common sources of the infection. But animal tuberculosis - officially known as zoonotic tuberculosis - also affects those in close contact with infected animals including vets, farmers and butchers. Dr Francisco Olea-Popelka, from the Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, said zoonotic tuberculosis was \"far more common than previously recognised.\" The best estimates suggest there are around 121,000 new cases of animal TB each year. The figure is tiny compared to human TB, which is the biggest lethal infection in the world. But Dr Olea-Popelka told the BBC News website: \"I think we should care.\" \"This is a well-known problem and has been neglected for decades, it is a disease that is preventable, treatable and curable and yet still today we have hundreds of thousands of people suffering from it. \"Ten thousand die every year from this disease, that's a lot of cases compared to many other diseases, why not care?\" he added. He is part of a group - including the WHO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the Stop TB Partnership - that has published a call to action in the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal. One of the biggest issues the report raises is the unknown scale of the problem. Studies in Mexico suggest 28 of all tuberculosis cases are down to zoonotic TB but a study in India put the figure at 9 and one in children in California suggested a figure of 45. Dr Paula Fujiwara, from the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, added: \"With approximately nine million individuals contracting TB globally each year, even relatively low percentages of zoonotic TB lead to large numbers of people suffering from this form of the disease.\" \"People living with zoonotic TB require specialized care, but in the vast majority of cases, they are not even adequately diagnosed,\" she added. Animal TB is caused by Mycobacterium bovis, which is a different infection to human TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. M. bovis is inherently resistant to one of the key drugs used to treat human TB - pyrazinamide. And Dr Olea-Popelka added: \"Once you get zoonotic TB it is often extrapulmonary TB, meaning it is not only in the lungs, but in other organs; that complicates the diagnosis and makes it more difficult to treat.\" How to tackle animal tuberculosis will be one of the themes of the Union World Conference on Lung Health taking place later this month. Dr Olea-Popelka said the key strategies for preventing zoonotic were: Each is easier said than done. Follow James on Twitter.",
        "Police were called to the area at about 20:30 BST on Thursday and the child was pronounced dead at the scene. The Health and Safety Executive (HSENI) is investigating the cause of death, which is understood to have involved farm machinery. The boy's death was the first of a child on a farm in Northern Ireland for almost three years, said the HSENI. There were seven deaths on Northern Ireland farms in 2016 and six the year before, it added. The last child to die in a farm fatality was in June 2014, when a boy died in a slurry tank accident near Dunloy, County Antrim. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the news had shocked the close-knit farming community in Fermanagh. Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliott said the community would rally around the \"very close\" family. \"The family have lost a son, a grandson and a brother and that's something I'm sure they will find very, very difficult to come to terms with,\" he said.

        "The Care Inspectorate and Healthcare Improvement Scotland looked at services provided by NHS Western Isles and local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar. The watchdogs said there were \"weaknesses\" and \"crucial areas for improvement\" in the services. They acknowledged that care provision was \"performing well in some aspects.\" The comhairle and health board provide the services as a partnership. A new report on the inspection carried out in April and June last year includes 12 recommendations for improvements. The inspectors said in the report that too many older people were subject to delayed discharge from hospital, and were having to wait too long for care-at-home support or a care home placement. They also identified \"very limited\" development of intermediate care services and said there was a need for \"timely diagnosis\" of dementia. Inspectors also flagged up where the health board and council have been working well. Front line health and social work staff were \"well motivated and worked well together,\" said the report. There was also a \"strong sense of community spirit\" among staff and patients. Karen Reid, chief executive of the Care Inspectorate, said: \"This report has highlighted important weaknesses in services provided for older people across the Western Isles, and we have clearly laid out our recommendations as to how these should be addressed. \"In particular, effective and consistent leadership is needed to ensure that services deliver better outcomes for older people who access them, and for their families and carers. \"We require significant improvement to ensure high-quality care is provided to older people in a way which reflects their needs and promotes their rights. \"The Care Inspectorate will now work with Healthcare Improvement Scotland and the Scottish government's chief social work adviser to directly support improvement in the partnership.\" Robbie Pearson, acting chief executive of Healthcare Improvement Scotland, said: \"In this joint inspection we found that most of the older people and carers that we met were generally happy with the services provided to them in the Western Isles. \"They felt that the services contributed to better outcomes in respect of their health and wellbeing. We also saw good examples of older people being supported to remain in their own homes. \"However, we found a number of important weaknesses that need to be addressed. A significant proportion of older people were subject to delayed discharges from hospital - this issue was raised in a previous inspection for the care of older people by Healthcare Improvement Scotland.\" He added: \"We are confident that the recommendations set out in this report will result in significant improvements in the care that older people receive.\"",
        "McCann is \"delighted\" with the seven new faces he has signed in recent weeks, but admits it has been tough. \"Identifying guys has been hard as the club really doesn't have any recruitment system behind it,\" he said. \"It's something I'll be speaking to our managing director, John Nelms, about because it's so important.\" Facing his first full season as Dundee boss, McCann says recruitment is \"top of the list of priorities\" for any manager and he is hoping to makes strides in that area ahead of the January transfer window. \"We need help,\" he added. \"We've been chasing our tails a bit this time. We need a database so that come January, if we want to strengthen, we have a list we can choose from rather than running about crazy 24 hours a day taking calls, looking on Wyscout, looking at games.\" Despite the difficulty, Dundee have managed to sign striker Sofien Moussa, midfielder Glen Kamara, defender Jack Hendry, winger Randy Wolters, midfielder Roarie Deacon and striker Rory Loy. Midfielder Scott Allan has also moved to Dens Park on a season-long loan from Celtic. \"It's been a real team effort between the staff this summer,\" McCann said. \"We've all mucked in and done our homework. \"You wouldn't believe the number of hours that have been put into recruitment. It's been extensive. \"I'm delighted with the guys we've brought in. They offer us something we didn't have. We have two different types now in a lot of key positions.\" McCann hopes recent recruit Moussa will receive clearance to complete his move before Tuesday's League Cup match away to Raith Rovers. Dundee were knocked out of the competition at the group stage last season and McCann, who took over in April and was named permanent manager in June, is determined to avoid a repeat. \"I don't want to use these games as a warm-up,\" he said. \"It's important that we start building a winning mentality from the first game of the season - starting on Tuesday. \"I don't think you can go into the season half-cocked. \"We will give every team we face the same respect we'd show Rangers or Celtic.

        "The Labour authority voted in favour of changing 2,700 contracts from 52 weeks to term time-only. The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and \"reduce the risk\" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was \"bitterly disappointed\" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: \"This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing PS200 - PS400 per month of their salary.\" She said there was \"no option\" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: \"It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs.\" Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would \"find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East\" and the council was \"very likely to face legal challenge.\" The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a \"real risk\" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: \"I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce.\" He said two consultations with assistants and the unions had failed to find agreement but it was hoped further discussions would resolve the matter without strike action being taken.",

        "Nether Edge Green Party councillor, Alison Teal, was served with a legal notice for her involvement in protests against Sheffield City Council's tree felling programme. Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A \"pre-action protocol letter\" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in \"direct action,\" from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters \"a chance to further and finally consider their position\" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of \"unlawful and costly disruption\" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. \"We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,\" he added. \"But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out.\" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. \"Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,\" he added. \"In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period.\" The council said, despite the letter, works were still being disrupted \"causing city-wide delays.\"",
        "The energy firm had proposed reinforcing the existing line so it can carry more electricity. Following an annual review of infrastructure project, the National Grid said the upgrade was not needed as this time. SSE said the scheme, which was opposed by the National Trust for Scotland, could be proposed again in the future. Last year, SSE selected its preferred \"corridor\" for the project. The corridor is the area of land in which the route of the upgraded line would be built. SSE made its selection from three possible corridors. The company said it had sought to avoid historic sites and landscapes, such as Culloden Battlefield and Bennachie. The battlefield is near Inverness, while Bennachie is a hill with a number of distinctive rocky tops in Aberdeenshire. SSE also said at the time that consent for the upgraded line could be sought from the Scottish government in 2019. The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) had raised concerns about the line being routed close to historic sites, such as Culloden Battlefield and the nearby Clava Cairns. A Jacobite force led by Bonnie Prince Charlie was defeated at Culloden by a government army in April 1746. The fighting took place over a wider area than the parts in the care of the National Trust for Scotland. Clava Cairns are prehistoric burial cairns built about 4,000 years ago. The Bronze Age cemetery complex includes passage graves, ring cairns, kerb cairn and standing stones. The site also has the remains of a chapel of unknown date.",

Devon and Cornwall Police conducted a search of the area but have not found the drone or operator. Insp Dave Meredith called it \"an incredibly concerning incident.\" Latest on the drone near miss, and other stories from Devon and Cornwall \"The close proximity of the drone to the passenger aircraft shows a complete disregard by the operator for public safety and we are appealing to the public for information to help us track down this reckless drone operator,\" Insp Meredith said. A spokeswoman for Cornwall Airport Newquay confirmed a drone had flown within the air traffic zone adjacent to the final approach to the airport as the plane flew in from London Stansted carrying 62 passengers. \"Although on this occasion there was no danger of collision, Air Traffic Control (ATC) reported this incident to the police as the drone should not have been flown in that area without ATC clearance and posed a potential danger to incoming flights,\" she said. A spokesperson for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said: \"Airspace proximity incidents, whether involving two aircraft, or a drone and an aircraft, need to be fully investigated to establish the level of risk involved.\" The UK Airprox Board, which investigates airspace proximity incidents, said it had not received any official report of the incident yet. Flybe said it would \"work closely\" with all relevant authorities to help identify the perpetrators of any activity which could jeopardise passenger safety. Operators of any small unmanned surveillance aircraft must not fly them within 50m (164 ft) of any vessel, vehicle or structure which is not under the user's control, unless they have obtained permission from the Civil Aviation Authority, according to the Air Navigation Order 2009.

        "Support workers believe that a report on children abused in the town between 1997 and 2013 may have under-estimated the number because it was unlikely to include the experiences of Asian girls. The Jay report, published in August, put the figure at at least 1,400. But Yasmin Ishaq, who has supported victims, said: \"It's not just the young white girls that they're targeting.\" Ms Ishaq, who runs a voluntary organisation, said men who they knew to be abusers had never been prosecuted and were also systematically abusing young girls within their own network of family and friends. She told BBC File on 4: \"The Pakistani girls are not going to be part and parcel of this report. There's no record of what's happened to them. They're too afraid to have ever gone to the law. \"The men will get away with this because nobody wants to address it and nobody wants to own up to the fact that their daughter has been molested.\" Although none of the victims would talk directly to the BBC, File on 4 heard reports of some Asian girls being blackmailed by grooming rings, while others were forced at knifepoint to perform sexual acts on men. Ms Ishaq described how one teenage girl she had been helping was taken to what she thought was a party by her boyfriend. \"When she got there, there was no party, there were no other female members present. What she found was that there were five adults, their ages ranging between their mid 20s going on to the late 40s and five men systematically, routinely, raped her. And the young man who was supposed to be her boyfriend, stood back and watched.\" Ms Ishaq explained that the group photographed the abuse and threatened to publish it unless she did as she was told. \"This is what is being said to her now: that if you do not comply, we will be submitting these photographs not only to your parents, to your fathers, to your brothers, but we will actually be posting them to local mosques,\" she said. \"She is still currently in this hell-hole. She cannot see how by going to the police or asking for their help, she can save herself from the consequences of what her family will do to her. She has a genuine fear that she will be beaten, she will be taken abroad, she will be forced into a marriage she doesn't want to be in.\" Listen to File on 4: The Last Taboo on 28 October at 20.00 GMT or later on iPlayer.

She's adamant they're all her boyfriends,\" said Zlakha Ahmed, head of Apna Haq, a group that supports women from ethnic minorities in Rotherham. \"She talks about the chocolates, the phones, the clothes, the presents, that they buy for her. They regularly pay for her train fare so she can go down to Manchester, Blackburn, London, Birmingham. \"When she arrives she'll go to a really posh hotel, she meets a number of these men and she's introduced to some of their friends. Then she'll always say,'I was given a drink and I don't remember what happened then'. \"She talks about how she wakes up in the morning and her legs hurt badly, and she's had a number of abortions. For us, that is gang-related abuse of a vulnerable woman. We know this is one young woman. How many others will they be abusing?\" There are no official figures for the number of cases of sexual abuse and grooming within the Asian community, and the Crown Prosecution Service does not record the ethnicities of the women in the cases that come to them.

        "Two men were convicted for carrying out abuse during the 1970s, 80s and 90s at the now closed Skircoat Lodge. Victim Kaz Gray said inquiries did not go far enough and some individuals were allegedly still working with children. Calderdale Council said no one involved in the historical cases still worked for the authority. In 2001, Malcom Phillips, who ran Skircoat Lodge for nearly 20 years, was jailed for seven years for repeated abuse of children in his care. A social worker there, Andrew Shadders, who abused boys, was jailed for 15 years. Another man, Terence O'Hagan, was charged with abuse but died before conviction. Ms Gray, who is leading the protest at the council's social services offices, said the scale of the abuse in care homes in Calderdale over that period of time was \"rampant.\" She said: \"When I went into care one of the first things they did was put me on the pill. \"I was 14, the youngest lass I knew of at the time on the pill in Skircoat was 11 years old.\" Ms Gray, who has waived her right to anonymity, was abused at Skircoat and said she was trafficked to a care home in North Wales where she was raped. She said she considered there were people still working with children in the area who had been \"complicit in the abuse\" of youngsters decades ago. \"Nothing's changed, nothing will change until everything comes out,\" she added. The council said it fully supported the investigation at the time. It added: This was an appalling case and we regret that children suffered when they were in the care of the local authority. \"I would like to reassure people that nobody involved in the historic cases works for the council, and in the intervening years our safeguarding practices have changed beyond recognition.\" Chief Supt Dickie Whitehead, Calderdale District Commander, said a thorough investigation was carried out by police and the council between 1997 and 2002 following allegations against a number of employees at Skircoat Lodge Assessment Centre and Dobroyd Castle.

WWE's service will be available through its Chinese partner PPTV, with subscribers required to download an app to access the content. Past events have \"received a great response from WWE fans in China,\" according to Godfrey Zeng, executive vice president of Suning Sports Media, parent company of PPTV. China has held a number of WWE events over the years, and there's even a local WWE-style wrestling organisation, but this is the first time an entire channel devoted to WWE will be available. The network will feature WWE's major live events and original series, as well as reality shows and classic matches. The organisation is kicking things off by making one of its marquee events SummerSlam, which takes place on Monday, available live in Mandarin. Sports ranging from mixed martial arts to Australian rules football have all been trying their luck in China. Other sports have managed to capitalise on the success of Chinese stars. The country's huge population means that most organisations would only need a small share of the market to see a return on their investment, but some industry watchers caution that it's not as easy it might seem. \"Everyone's trying to break into China, and you've all got those much more established sports.

FP McCann issued proceedings over the tender for the work it submitted in 2009 as part of a joint venture with Balfour Beatty in a public procurement process run by the DRD's Road Service. The consortium, referred to as BBMC, did not secure the contract on the grounds that it had submitted an abnormally low tender, the court heard. Lawyers for FP McCann claimed it had been unlawfully denied the work and should be entitled to damages. The judge said there had been a clear breach of duty by the defendant in respect of its consideration of the BBMC bid. Adjourning the case for further submissions in assessing the scale of payout, he added: \"The defendant's breach of duty should be marked by a meaningful award to reflect the loss of opportunity to the plaintiff to be awarded a significant and potentially lucrative contract.\"",
        "Haroon Syed, of west London, admitted preparing acts of terrorism after trying to source weapons including a suicide bomb and machine gun. He was caught after approaching MI5 officers, who were posing as a fellow extremist, via social media. Syed was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years and six months. Last year, his brother was jailed for life for plotting to behead someone on Remembrance Sunday. Judge Michael Topolski QC said Syed wanted to carry out \"an act of mass murder\" and therefore a discretionary life sentence was warranted. Prosecutors say Syed's plans ranged from becoming a suicide bomber to staging a gun attack, and while he initially boasted of working with others, those people did not materialise. Instead, over the summer of last year, he made increasingly urgent efforts to secure weaponry. After he went online looking for help, a purported jihadist fighting overseas, known only as Abu Isa, introduced him to another extremist going by the name Abu Yusuf. This second man was, in fact, a group of MI5 officers who were playing the role of a jihadist in what became weeks of social media chat with Syed. Teen admits planning'London bomb attack' Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey there was initially some \"suspicion on both sides\" before Abu Yusuf concluded that Syed was a \"committed brother\" he could deal with. Syed then began talking about his aspirations and gave his contact a shopping list, saying he wanted \"do martyrdom\" after first causing \"damage\" with a machine gun. \"Can you get the gear?\" asked Syed. \"You will be involved right? \"Two things. Number one, machine gun and we need someone who can make a vest you know the dugma [button] one. So after some damage with machine gun then do itishadi [martyrdom].... that's what I'm planning to do.\" The undercover officer told Syed guns were expensive - but he might be able to get someone to build a bomb. Syed floated the idea of going to fight overseas with his new-found friend - but revealed his passport had been cancelled by the authorities. He tried and failed twice to get fraudulent loans of thousands of pounds to cover the cost of firearms - and eventually agreed to meet his contact in a coffee shop in Slough, Berkshire, to finalise an alternative plan. Over two meetings, he talked about his aspirations and then handed over PS150, asking for a bomb packed with nails. The conversation was secretly recorded. \"I was thinking of Oxford Street,\" he told his contact. \"If you put those things inside called nails, do you know what that is, nails? Those sharp things - lots of them inside. \"Good man, can't wait akhi [brother]. If I go to prison, I go to prison. If I die, I die, you understand? I have got to get to Jannah [heaven].\" The undercover officer later told Syed a \"bomb-making brother\" would have the device ready within days - and the suspect went online to narrow his list of targets. His web searches included \"packed places in London\" and \"Elton John, Hyde Park, 11 September\" - a major concert hosted by BBC Radio 2 which also featured Status Quo and Madness. Prosecutors say Syed's character had begun to change outwardly in late 2014, coinciding with the growing support among British extremists for the self-styled Islamic State group. During the course of the investigation, detectives found his web searches jumped about as he tried to satisfy himself that an attack on civilians was theologically justifiable. One of his last searches, a week before his arrest, was: \"How can I stop being upset about the UK killing innocent Syrians and get on with my day?\" When counter-terrorist detectives arrested him in September and asked him for the password for his phone, he replied: \"ISIS - you like that?\" Syed's was one of 18 terror plots to have been foiled since 2013. Mitigating, Mark Summers QC said it was a \"crude, ill-thought-out\" plan made at the behest of others. The court heard Syed had fallen under the influence of members of banned extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, and that he now publicly rejected his past beliefs and condemned the recent bomb attack in Manchester. But Judge Topolski told Syed: \"You were not lured, you were not enticed, you were not entrapped. \"You became, and in my judgement as shown by your online activities away from your contact with Abu Yusuf, deeply committed to the ideology of a brutal and barbaric organisation that sought to hijack and corrupt an ancient and venerable religion for its own purposes and you wanted to be part of it.\" Deb Walsh, deputy head of the counter-terrorism division of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Haroon Syed is clearly a danger to the public who was prepared to carry out indiscriminate attacks against innocent people. \"The compelling evidence presented by the CPS left him with no choice but to plead guilty.\"",

        "The vote in the St Louis suburb is the first since the death of Michael Brown last August led to protests. A federal investigation found racial bias in the Ferguson police department was widespread. Two-thirds of Ferguson's residents are black and now half the council. Shortly after the results came out, a video emerged showing an unarmed black man being shot dead by a police officer in South Carolina. State investigators said the officer, Michael Slager, would be charged with murder after the video showed him firing at Walter Lamer Scott who was running away. Turnout in Ferguson increased from 12 at the last elections, in 2013, to 29. Wesley Bell, who defeated another black candidate in Ferguson's third ward, said: \"This community came out in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard. \"When you have a community engaged, the sky is the limit.\" A drive by activists to register new voters and encourage previously disenfranchised residents to vote appeared to have paid off. \"People in general want to see change,\" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told the Reuters news agency. Ella Jones defeated another black candidate and two white candidates in Ferguson's first ward to become the first black woman on the council. Black residents in Ferguson protested for several days last August after Mr Brown was shot dead by St Louis police officer Darren Wilson. The protests spread nationwide in November when it was announced that Mr Wilson, who has since left the police, would not be charged. US police have faced severe criticism from rights groups in the wake of Mr Brown's death, with a series of high-profile deaths of unarmed black men in police custody.",
        "However, that's at the heart of the media's frustration. The fact is the campaign has become a succession of tightly controlled photo opportunities.... by all the main parties. This has become the hi-vis, hard hat election. It's been the predictable campaign gear for both David Cameron and George Osborne. No walkabouts. No risk of a verbal ambush by ordinary voters. But there's a fascinating side to this election where the campaign can offer raw politics, unplugged.... where the voters engage with the politicians seeking their support. Election hustings have been one of the big successes of this general election. Magazine Monitor: Where did the word'hustings' come from? There have been a record number of them held in churches, according to research by one Christian charity. I've been to a number of hustings so far and there's one reason why they work. The debates and exchanges are close up and often personal. Voters are able to question the politicians and get beyond some of the campaign sound bites and slogans. They also often highlight issues that are just overlooked in the \"noise\" of national campaigning. That was the case at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience were mostly from the city's African Caribbean communities. On the platform, representatives from all the parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, who's defending a 6,000 Labour majority in Derby South. There were questions from the audience on immigration, Europe and schools. But one question particularly gripped the audience: Why were graduates from the African Caribbean communities three times more likely to be out of a job, six months after leaving university? The study was carried out by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, and was based on interviews with 2,500 students over two years. It also found that black students were not being given the same opportunities as white students. One angry voice in the audience shouted: \"That's outrageous and disgraceful.\" It got backing from the Greens. \"That indicates there's some form of discrimination going on in the jobs market,\" said John Devine, the Green Party candidate for Derbyshire's Amber Valley. There was a suggestion from one questioner for employers to be forced by law to audit who and where they recruit staff. A precise solution perhaps required a precise response. But the Conservatives' Derby South candidate Evonne Williams tiptoed round this one. \"It's something that we haven't considered but I'm happy to take it back to the party,\" she told the questioner. And Labour's Dame Margaret? \"We're going to be looking at the Equalities Act to see if it needs modernising and updating. So your suggestion is exactly the kind of idea we will be looking at,\" she said. One platform speaker wanted to go much further. Lucy Care, the Lib Dem's candidate for Derby North, suggested that all job application forms should no longer include the person's name. \"We would like to have name blank application forms,\" she said. \"So all you read is their experience and what they've done. Often the name of the applicant can deter some employers from short listing or recruiting.\" As for UKIP's Derby South hopeful Victor Webb, he didn't completely rule out having such a recruitment audit, but: \"I wouldn't do this because of the burden of cost and regulation on small businesses.\" For this hustings audience, maybe no instant solutions but they got the politicians thinking about their concerns. \"The key is getting people engaged,\" said Marc Grant, the event organiser. \"It's the first time we've held a hustings at the church.\" \"We wanted to show why politics is so important to our daily lives and I'm really pleased so many people came along.\" Whatever the outcome of this election, the locally organised hustings have emerged as a big campaign winner.",
        "A period of uncertainty over political leadership after the announcement that David Cameron would quit has not made the mandarins' lives any easier. One familiar and important issue has bubbled up to the surface again - NHS finances. The fraught task of finalising the Department of Health's accounts for the last financial year is close to completion. Sources indicate it's touch and go as to whether the department kept to its spending limit agreed by parliament for the health service in England. An overspend would be a serious breach of Whitehall protocol and lead to senior officials being hauled over the coals by the National Audit Office. Ministers and the leadership of the NHS in England are determined to demonstrate they have got a grip on the finances. To that end, a major initiative is planned involving commitments by all trusts in England to stick to agreed spending limits. The regulator, NHS Improvement, under pressure from the government, is straining every sinew to bring down the PS2.4bn total deficit racked up by trusts in the last financial year. Putting finance directors' feet to the fire and extracting pledges to stay on budget has been the priority in recent weeks. The NHS financial announcement is likely next week and could well come on the same day as the publication of the Department of Health accounts. The government line will be that running up unplanned deficits and risking breaches of limits set by parliament will be no longer acceptable. At a conference organised by the Reform think tank, the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt talked of the need to \"restore financial discipline.\" He said that trusts should not assume there was a choice between maintaining patient care standards and controlling their finances and that the two were not incompatible. Mr Hunt argued that the hospital trusts with the best ratings by the Care Quality Commission tended to be those with the lowest deficits. But announcing commitments to prudent spending is one thing, delivering them is another. Once winter and the second half of the financial year arrives, the pressures will mount. It's hard to see what sanctions can be applied to trust managements who feel they have to go over their agreed budgets to meet relentlessly increasing demand for patient care. At some hospital trusts, the inevitable consequence of sticking to agreed spending totals will be longer waiting lists. Looking longer term, the referendum has raised more questions about the sustainability of NHS finances. The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for politicians from either side of the referendum campaign to ensure that pledges for a better funded NHS made during the campaign are delivered. But it will be harder to hold out the begging bowl to the Treasury. The Health Foundation think tank has pointed out that the public finances will be under even greater pressure with economists revising down short-term economic growth forecasts in the wake of the Brexit vote. Anita Charlesworth of the Foundation made the point that when the economy sneezes the NHS catches cold and that the service's finances were already \"in a truly dire state.\" Ministers argue that the government has already made a significant commitment to funding above the rate of inflation for the NHS at a time when other parts of Whitehall are being severely squeezed. They say that making better use of resources, through greater efficiency, is well within the capability of most trusts. But as the NHS celebrates its 68th birthday, the question marks over financial sustainability are perhaps as big as they ever have been. How things will look when the service celebrates its landmark 70th anniversary is anyone's guess.",
        "The Grade II-listed Drummond Mill on Lumb Lane in Manningham was ravaged by a fire which started in the basement on Thursday. The building has now been partially demolished to prevent further collapse. Historic England said West Yorkshire's mills are \"important landmarks which need to be cherished.\" The organisation, which preserves and lists historic buildings, is currently part-way through a review into West Yorkshire's mills to establish best practice for future redevelopments. Spokesperson Deborah Wall said: \"The community is deeply affected and emotional about the loss of this historic building. \"It just shows how important these landmarks are to people and why the work to find ways to capture the stories of these places and to cherish them is so important.\" Last month, property consultants Cushman and Wakefield began work with architects and Historic England to examine ways in which West Yorkshire's vacant textile mills could be brought back into use. Trevor Mitchell, Historic England's planning director for Yorkshire, said: \"West Yorkshire's textile mills are iconic buildings that people care deeply about. \"Some have been brilliantly and creatively converted into places to work, live or socialise. \"We are working to understand how these successful conversions have been achieved and try to find solutions for those mills that need a new purpose to become great landmarks in our region again.\" Successful redevelopments include Tower Works and Marshalls in Leeds, Sunny Bank Mills in Pudsey, Lister Mills in Bradford, Salts Mill in Saltaire, Red Brick Mill in Batley, and Dean Clough in Halifax. Yorkshire has 172 listed textile mills. Ms Wall said the future of Drummond Mill was \"totally uncertain\" until Bradford Council and the fire service had determined the full extent of the damage.",
        "Bromyard Community Hospital in Herefordshire is drafting in help from the Philippines and Europe to bridge the 80-post gap. It comes after staff agreed to work extra hours to save the in-patient ward from closure. But The Wye Valley NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said this was a temporary measure. Paul Hooton, the hospital's deputy director of nursing, said: \"We are very pleased with our staff and how they have stepped up and said they could do extra to help us to keep in-patients open. \"But we have to review it on an ongoing basis to make sure that we can ultimately deliver safe inpatient care.\" \"We have a major recruitment campaign going on locally to try and attract nurses living within our local community back into nursing.\" Its recruitment advert said it was looking for newly-qualified nurses and people who had left the profession. Mr Hooton added: \"To put it into context, we are not the only trust in the country that is desperate to recruit nurses - this is a national problem.\"",
        "Edwina Hart accused UK officials of \"ignorance\" amid suggestions passengers could have to change trains on some services between Wales and England. Responsibility for the Wales and Border network will be devolved in 2017. A Department of Transport spokesman said no decisions would be made without considering local views. Services from Aberystwyth to Birmingham and Milford Haven to Manchester via Cardiff, are among routes which could be affected. In last year's St David's Day agreement, the UK government wrote: \"In order for the secretary of state for transport to ensure proper accountability, it is likely that services primarily serving English markets will be placed into other franchises for which the Secretary of State for Transport is the franchising authority.\" Responding to suggestions some passengers may have to change trains on cross-border routes, Mrs Hart said some Whitehall officials \"don't actually understand how things work and what are important.\" \"I base some of their comments on ignorance rather than a conspiracy theory,\" she said. \"We want to ensure those services remain within the franchise.\" John Rogers from campaign group Railfutures Wales said: \"It's ludicrous, it's impractical, it's being done behind the scenes with a lot of secrecy initially and we're determined to fight it.\" \"It's not in the interests of passengers. People hate changing trains, it's a deterrent and it would affect the tourist industry,\" he added. A Department for Transport spokesman said: \"We are working closely with the Welsh government to develop plans for cross-border routes and stations as we move towards devolving the next Wales and Border franchise.\"",
        "Benjamin Netanyahu said he would raise renewing sanctions when he meets US President Donald Trump in February. Iran has carried out several such tests since a 2015 nuclear deal which relaxed sanctions against the country. It is not yet clear what type of missile was launched, or if it explicitly violated the UN resolution. A 2010 resolution, which barred Iran from undertaking any work on \"ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads,\" was terminated after the nuclear deal with six world powers was implemented. It was replaced by a new resolution, 2231, that \"calls upon\" Iran not to undertake any activity related to \"ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.\" The UN Security Council is to hold a meeting on Tuesday about the missile launch, at the request of the US. In a recorded message on his Facebook page, Mr Netanyahu said \"Iranian aggression must not go unanswered.\" Mr Netanyahu is a fierce critic of the nuclear deal with Iran, which calls for the eradication of the Jewish state. Benjamin Netanyahu's condemnation of the Iranian missile test is clearly intended to push the new Trump administration to take action against Tehran. Iran will be high on the agenda when the two men meet in mid-February, though it is as much Iran's regional activities as its missile programme that worries the Israelis. Iran's missile tests are controversial. While they do not break the terms of the nuclear deal between Iran and the major powers - this did not cover missile development - they may well be a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. The Iranians insist that, since they have no plans for nuclear weapons, the tests are not prohibited. Iran's launch may well force Mr Trump to give a clearer indication of what practical steps he intends to take against Tehran. Iran has not commented directly on the missile launch. When asked about it at a news conference on Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said only that \"the missile issue is not part of the nuclear deal.\" Iran says its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes, but world powers suspect it of seeking to develop nuclear weapons. The White House said it was studying the details of the incident. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the missile had broken up before the test was completed. But US Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the foreign relations committee, said: \"No longer will Iran be given a pass for its repeated ballistic missile violations.\" Mr Trump has previously called the Iran nuclear deal \"a disaster\" and suggested his administration will abandon it. But that has drawn criticism from senior figures, including the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John Brennan. Mr Brennan, who stepped down when President Trump took office, told the BBC late last year that tearing up the agreement \"would be the height of folly\" and \"disastrous.\" But Mike Pompeo, who has succeeded Mr Brennan as director of the CIA, was a prominent critic of the deal.",

        "However, the report concluded there had been \"no overarching state conspiracy.\" Sir Desmond de Silva's review confirmed that agents of the state were involved in the 1989 killing and that it should have been prevented. Mr Finucane's widow, Geraldine, has dismissed the report as a \"sham\" and a \"whitewash.\" Mr Finucane was shot dead by loyalists in front of his wife and children at his north Belfast home. The review, published on Wednesday, found RUC officers proposed Mr Finucane, 39, be killed, said they passed information to his killers and failed to stop the attack and then obstructed the murder investigation. It also found that an Army intelligence unit, the FRU, \"bears a degree\" of responsibility because one of their agents, Brian Nelson, was involved in selecting targets. The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Matt Baggott, said the police fully accepted the findings of the report. He offered a \"complete, absolute and unconditional\" apology to the Finucane family, saying they had been \"abjectly failed.\" He said that in the coming days the PSNI would discuss the report with the Police Ombudsman and the Public Prosecution Service. Pat Finucane review reaction \"Pat Finucane's murder should never have happened and it is a catalogue of failing which now needs to be assessed to see whether there are people who can be held accountable,\" he said. Mrs Finucane said the government had \"engineered a suppression of the truth\" behind her husband's murder. His family have led a high-profile campaign for a full public inquiry into the murder but Mr Cameron has ruled that out. Mrs Finucane said: \"At every turn, it is clear that this report has done exactly what was required - to give the benefit of the doubt to the state, its cabinet and ministers, to the Army, the intelligence services, to itself. \"At every turn, dead witnesses have been blamed, and defunct agencies found wanting. Serving personnel and active state departments appear to have been excused. \"The dirt has been swept under the carpet without any serious attempt to lift the lid on what really happened to Pat and so many others.\" The Finucanes did not co-operate with the review and the solicitor's widow said the de Silva report did not tell her much more than she previously knew about the case. Her son, Michael, claimed the government had refused their demand for a full inquiry because it did not want people to be questioned in public. There were extensive \"leaks\" of security force information to the UDA and other loyalist paramilitary groups. There was a failure by the authorities to act on threat intelligence. Employees of the State and State agents played \"key roles\" in the murder. There was a failure to investigate and arrest key members of the West Belfast UDA over a long period of time. There was a wider \"relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice\" after the murder had taken place. Sir Desmond found that \"senior Army officers deliberately lied to criminal investigators\" and that RUC Special Branch \"were responsible for seriously obstructing the investigation.\" The report concluded that Nelson did not provide his handlers with details of the plot against Mr Finucane. It found that MI5 received intelligence two months before the killing that Mr Finucane was under threat but that no steps were taken to protect him. It also found that MI5 helped spread propaganda against Mr Finucane in the years before he was killed. Sir Desmond found that \"in 1985 the security service assessed that 85 of the UDA's'intelligence' originated from sources within the security forces.\" And he was \"satisfied that this proportion would have remained largely unchanged\" by the time of Mr Finucane's murder.\" Sir Desmond de Silva QC carried out the review at the government's request. The Finucanes want a public inquiry as they feared the full truth would not emerge. In his report Sir Desmond said: \"A series of positive actions by employees of the state actively furthered and facilitated his murder and that, in the aftermath of the murder, there was a relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice. \"My review of the evidence relating to Patrick Finucane's case has left me in no doubt that agents of the state were involved in carrying out serious violations of human rights up to and including murder. \"However, despite the different strands of involvement by elements of the state, I am satisfied that they were not linked to an over-arching state conspiracy to murder Patrick Finucane.\" Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Cameron was strongly critical of the RUC and Army for their conduct in relation to the killing. He said Sir Desmond concluded that there was \"no political conspiracy\" over the murder but that \"ministers were misled.\" Mr Cameron added that the report found \"no evidence whatsoever that any government minister had fore-knowledge of Mr Finucane's murder.\" He said that on behalf of the government and the whole country he wanted to say to the Finucane family that he was \"deeply sorry.\" Last year, Mr Cameron acknowledged there was state collusion in Mr Finucane's murder and apologised to his family. In the report, Sir Desmond found that an account one of the murderers, Ken Barrett, gave to the BBC Panorama programme about receiving intelligence from the RUC was \"essentially accurate.\" However, he added that some specific allegations made by Barrett against individual officers were not reliable. Former Ulster Unionist MP Lord Maginnis of Drumglass said the apology was \"ridiculous.\" \"The reality is that the Finucane family were an IRA family and I can illustrate that by saying that, when I gave that allegation publicly and was being sued for libel, the family retracted and paid my legal expenses,\" he told the House of Lords. \"So let's not fool ourselves about the godfather Finucane, who was killed.\"",
        "Afusat Saliu, 31, and Bassy, four, and Rashidat, two, from Leeds, had been due to leave on a Virgin Atlantic flight to Lagos at 22:20 BST on Thursday. The airline's boss Sir Richard Branson received more than 1,000 tweets calling on him to intervene personally. The Home Office would not confirm whether deportation had been delayed. Ms Saliu and her daughters were arrested by UK Border Agency staff on Wednesday. Anj Handa, a close friend of the family, said: \"Afusat was meant to be given 72 hours' notice before she was actually deported, and the Home Office totally ignored that. Finally they have accepted that. \"She is not going to be deported tonight or tomorrow morning but that does not mean she is not going to be deported. \"She has been given an overnight reprieve but the campaign is still very much ongoing and the lawyers are still working on her judicial review. \"We are still urging people to keep up the pressure to help her stay in this country while the case is reviewed.\" Ms Saliu's solicitors BP Legal have launched a judicial review in an attempt to allow her to remain in the UK. They say officials have ignored their own guidelines by ordering her deportation before the review is heard. Earlier, Sir Richard Branson said in a statement: \"Without knowing the specifics on the case it is very difficult to comment in detail on a legal decision taken by the Home Office. \"While Virgin Atlantic cannot confirm whether any passengers are or are not flying with them due to data protection laws, they would view any case like this with the safety and welfare of all passengers their primary concern \"Regardless, if Afusat Saliu and her family are deported to Nigeria we call upon the UK and Nigerian governments to do all they can to protect the family and ensure they are not put at risk of female genital mutilation.\" Sir Richard described female genital mutilation (FGM) as an \"horrendous practice and a serious violation of internationally recognised human rights.\" He called on the authorities to give the Saliu family all the support and protection possible. Ms Saliu fled from Nigeria in 2011 after her stepmother threatened to subject Bassy to female genital mutilation. Ms Saliu, who is herself a victim of FGM, was heavily pregnant at the time. She has said she fears both her daughters will be subjected to the practice and forced into marriage should they return to Nigeria. The family converted to Christianity in the UK and worry they would be targeted by Islamist militants Boko Haram in the west African country. It is understood the Salius were taken into custody and detained at a holding centre in Sheffield before being moved to a family immigration centre in Crawley, West Sussex. More than 120,000 people have signed a petition calling on the Home Office reconsider the case. A Home Office spokeswoman said it did not comment on individual cases.",

        "A new grading system will use numbers instead of letters, and coursework is being scrapped for most subjects. The changes will be in stages, starting with pupils due to take GCSE exams in 2017. Those who turn 13 in this academic year will be the first. English and maths will be the first subjects affected. Pupils will begin studying the new courses in English language, English literature and maths from the autumn of 2015. And about 20 other popular GCSE subjects will be revamped in the same way, ready for teaching a year later, in 2016, with the first exams for those taken in 2018. The changes apply to England only. Wales is planning its own GCSE shake-up, but Northern Ireland is not planning any changes. Scotland has its own exams system. While they come in, pupils in England will have some exams graded with numbers and some with letters, leading teaching unions to warn this will be confusing for pupils, parents and employers. The GCSE changes being announced will apply only to pupils in England. Scotland has its own exam system, but Wales and Northern Ireland also use GCSEs. Wales is also planning a shake-up, bringing in its own new GCSEs in maths, English and Welsh, which will be taught from the autumn of 2015. In Northern Ireland no changes to GCSEs are planned. A recent review concluded there was \"no case for replacing A-levels or GCSEs in the short or medium term.\" Exams will be graded from 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest. Pupils who fail will be awarded a \"U\" for an unclassified result. All exams will be taken after two years of study, rather than in modules taken at various stages over two years, meaning a return to the format of O-levels, which pre-dated GCSEs. And there will be more marks awarded for spelling, punctuation and grammar. The head of Ofqual, Glenys Stacey, said the changes were \"fundamental.\" \"This is the biggest change in a generation,\" she said. \"They [GCSEs] have been around for over 25 years but now we are seeing fresh content, a different structure, high-quality assessment coming in. \"It's a significant change for students and for schools.\" Ms Stacey said the move to a numerical system meant a new grade was being added and that would help examiners distinguish between candidates' performance - especially at the top grades. She suggested that the move away from traditional grades might be hard for some people to understand, but was important. \"The new qualifications will be significantly different and we need to signal this clearly,\" she said. At the same time, the government is confirming changes to what has to be studied in English language, English literature and maths, because the overhaul of exams covers both what is studied and how it is assessed. It says in English literature, students will have to \"study whole texts in detail, covering a range of literature including Shakespeare, 19th Century novels, Romantic poetry and other high-quality fiction and drama.\" The new maths exam will cover more topics and will be more challenging, the government says. Details were released on Friday morning. For maths, Ofqual is keeping the present arrangement where pupils can be entered for either a higher- or lower-tier paper in maths, depending on their ability. But in English, that division has been scrapped and one exam will be taken by all. At the moment, students who are entered for easier papers can be awarded only the maximum of a C grade. The government says young people were let down by the old exam system; that frequent testing meant not enough time was spent on \"deep learning\" and not enough attention was paid to grammar, spelling and punctuation. Schools Minister Elizabeth Truss says the changes will improve students' \"core skills\" in maths and English and raise expectations. \"What we want to do is encourage schools to focus on those core skills that employers really want, because that is what is going to help our children get jobs when they leave school,\" she said. Headteachers' representative, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), gave what it said was a \"cautious welcome\" to the changes. Deputy general secretary Malcolm Trobe said: \"There is much to welcome in today's announcement, especially the measured approach Ofqual has taken to this significant task. This announcement seals the introduction of changes that have been in the pipeline for a while. The moves amount to a big structural change to England's exam system and signal a clear break from the previous situation when students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland sat similar forms of GCSEs. The move towards \"linear\" assessment, where everything rests on exams taken at the end of two years, is already under way, but the announcement of the removal of coursework from most GCSE subjects cements that. As teachers, pupils and parents look ahead, they might wonder whether the alterations would survive any change in government. A general election is scheduled for May 2015 - months before the teaching for these new courses begins. Ofqual's Glenys Stacey says there is a \"great deal of consensus that GCSEs need to reform\" and that she does not sense \"strong resistance\" to the changes from politicians. But there are clearly points on which the parties differ. \"We have always agreed that GCSE can be improved to better prepare students to meet the needs of the world we live in today. But the constant tinkering with GCSEs we have had in the past has not been helpful.\" Unions representing classroom teachers warned that a shift away from coursework and having different levels of exams for different abilities could damage some pupils' education. Secondary school teacher and spokesman for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Jovan Trkulja, said that less able students could suffer. \"Exams are challenging and they should continue to be challenging. But we have to remember that setting the top of the mountain as the baseline means someone has to fall behind, and I feel for the sense of failure for the less able,\" he said. Shadow schools minister, Labour MP Kevin Brennan, said he had \"reservations\" about some aspects of the changes and that the move towards a numbered grading system was a step back to the 1970s. He said he agreed that the pendulum \"might have swung a little too far on coursework,\" but there was now a danger that \"it will swing too far the other way.\" \"Having everything staked on one final exam is not great for all pupils,\" he said.",
        "The home secretary and Tory leadership candidate told the Daily Mail it would be \"sheer madness\" to give up the UK's nuclear deterrent because of the threat posed by countries including Russia. Renewing Trident would show Britain was \"committed\" to working with Nato allies after voting for Brexit, she added. Labour is split over Trident, with Jeremy Corbyn opposing its renewal. Mrs May, seen as the front runner in the contest to replace David Cameron, said there was a \"rapidly changing terrorist threat\" from groups including so-called Islamic State and Boko Haram. But she disputed the suggestion this meant the UK no longer needed a nuclear deterrent, saying the UK still faced threats from \"conventional enemies.\" Mrs May said this included Russia, which had showed \"renewed beligerence\" in its annexation of Crimea, and North Korea, which she said \"continues to defy international law with its nuclear programme.\" Since 1969, according to government documents, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans. The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor, a concept known as mutually assured destruction. The submarines carry up to eight Trident missiles; each can be fitted with a number of warheads. Read more about the history of the UK's nuclear weapons system Pledging to make a \"strong defence an important priority\" if she is elected leader of the Conservatives, Mrs May wrote: \"In the face of such strong evidence, it would be sheer madness to contemplate even for a moment giving up Britain's independent nuclear deterrent. \"And there is no room for compromise, and no room for cheese paring. \"We need a full fleet of four submarines, capable between them of providing what the military call'Continuous At Sea Deterrence', or permanent, around-the-clock cover. \"Doing so will send an important message that, as Britain leaves the European Union, we remain committed to working alongside our Nato allies and playing our full role in the world.\" Parliament is to hold a vote later this year on whether to proceed with building successor submarines to the existing Vanguard fleet, which is due to become obsolete by the end of the next decade. Mrs May said the vote should take place before the Commons summer break begins on 21 July, adding \"we should get on with getting it built.\" She said: \"A lot of parliamentary business has, for obvious reasons, been put on hold until the leadership election is complete and a new prime minister is in post. \"But when it comes to the nuclear deterrent, the national interest is clear, the Conservatives are united, and we have waited long enough.\" Labour has become split over the renewal of Trident following the election of leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is a life-long opponent of nuclear weapons. Mr Corbyn is at odds with many of his MPs over the future of the UK nuclear weapons system - which the government has estimated will cost PS31bn to renew - and has commissioned a review led by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry to look at its future, likely to report in the summer. He has previously suggested the UK could keep its Trident submarine fleet but without carrying nuclear warheads. The Conservative leadership contest was sparked by Mr Cameron's decision to step down as prime minster after the UK voted by 52 to 48 to leave the EU, in the June referendum. The other candidates are energy minister Andrea Leadsom, Justice Secretary Michael Gove, Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb and former defence secretary Liam Fox.

Before the law was passed, there were about 100 so-called \"headshops\" selling legal highs across the state, but that number has since been reduced to zero. \"The headshop industry is gone,\" Det Supt Tony Howard told the BBC. He is a member of the Garda (Irish police) Drugs Unit, which has been responsible for enforcing the new legislation. \"We were worried because we saw a whole generation of young people starting to experiment with these new psychoactive substances, and they'd generally be people who wouldn't have otherwise engaged in the misuse of drugs,\" he said. \"They thought it was safe because of the perception that these were legal highs.\" When the blanket ban took effect, it became illegal to advertise, sell, supply, import or export psychoactive substances in the Republic of Ireland. Tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and medicines have been excluded from the ban. Before the legislation came into force, the sale of legal highs appeared to be a very lucrative business. When one Dublin city centre headshop was burnt down in an arson attack, firefighters found a safe in the charred rubble of the building that contained 450,000 euros (PS330,000). As the sale of psychoactive substances was not illegal at the time, police had to hand the cash back to the owner of the safe. As a result of the ban, that would not happen now. Det Supt Howard said many of those who operated the headshops quickly complied with the new law. \"Essentially the industry themselves realised that the legislation was quiet strong and they actually co-operated with us and handed us over any residual product which they had,\" he said. So, should the UK follow the Irish government's lead and outlaw legal highs? It may have taken the headshops out of the high street but not everyone believes the ban is the most effective way to protect drug users. Tony Duffin, director of the Ana Liffey Drug Project in Dublin said there was still \"huge harm\" associated with the substances formally sold by headshops. He said many recreational users are now buying psychoactive substances over the internet instead, and more regular users just go to drug dealers. \"I'm aware that, in New Zealand, they are currently rolling out legislation to regulate headshop drugs. So I think that, in terms of the UK, they would do well to look at all the options on the table in terms of drug policy,\" Mr Duffin said. \"It's not always about prohibition.\"",
        "The first minister signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SinoFortone and another Chinese firm in March. After reports that the agreement has now been cancelled, the Scottish government highlighted a \"climate of hostility\" from opposition parties. Opponents of the deal called for a full statement on the \"sorry episode.\" The agreement, said to be worth up to PS10bn, was signed with representatives of SinoFortone Group and China Railway No. 3 Engineering Group (CR3) at Nicola Sturgeon's official Bute House residence in Edinburgh. However opposition parties voiced fears about the deal, amid concerns CR3's parent company China Railway Group had been named in an Amnesty International report on human rights abuses and had been blacklisted by Norway's oil fund. Ms Sturgeon said no specific deals would be done with the Chinese consortium if legitimate concerns were uncovered, with all actual investments to be scrutinised by the Scottish Parliament. The Sunday Times newspaper reported the deal had collapsed in August and claimed it had become known in China as the \"Scottish shambles.\" A spokesman for Economy Secretary Keith Brown said the government was aware of some concerns but had not thought the deal was off. He also said opposition parties should be \"ashamed\" for putting potential investments at risk. The spokesman said: \"We did not consider that the MOU had been cancelled but were aware that SinoFortone felt they could not move ahead at that time in the climate of hostility they faced from other parties. \"However, they continued to believe in the benefits for Scotland of an infrastructure partnership with China and we remained committed to pursuing these opportunities. \"The MOU is about building relationships with a view to investment and we remain committed to it. We are sorry if the partners consider the MOU to be cancelled and we remain open to working together on projects in the future.\" Opposition parties maintained their stance, with Labour's Jackie Baillie demanding the government \"come clean\" about the fate of the agreement \"as a matter of urgency.\" She said: \"Scotland deserves answers on this backroom deal - the whole affair poses serious questions about the transparency and competence of SNP ministers. The SNP government's handling of this has been cackhanded from the very beginning, so it is no wonder it has been branded a shambles. \"The SNP tried to hush up this deal throughout the election, and now we find out that it fell apart months ago, and yet the Scottish people - once again - were none the wiser.\" Scottish Conservative economy spokesman Dean Lockhart added: \"This whole episode has shown the SNP just can't be trusted with economic matters. It thought it had struck gold, tried and failed to keep it a secret, and now doesn't seem to know what's going on. \"We now need a calm assessment of all this to see if a potentially lucrative deal with China can be reached. These things can't be allowed to fall through because of SNP bungling.\" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who lodged 28 parliamentary questions about the MOU on the first day of the new Holyrood term, also called for an \"urgent statement\" from Mr Brown about the affair. He said: \"They must explain what recent discussions they have had with these Chinese companies, what lessons they have learned from this sorry episode and what new arrangements will be put in place to attract ethical investment for Scotland. \"The SNP has a chance to inject some much needed transparency for something that has been clouded in secrecy. Throughout this whole process groups such as Amnesty International and Transparency International expressed concerns but the SNP covered their ears and ploughed on regardless. The showed a casual disregard for human rights.\" The Scottish government spokesman said opposition parties should be \"ashamed,\" accusing them of \"doing Scotland down.\" He said: \"The opposition should be ashamed of themselves if their actions, in search of cheap headlines, have put up to PS10bn of investment at risk. \"The Scottish government will do everything we can to make sure that Scotland is open for business. It would be helpful if opposition parties joined us in making the case for Scotland, rather than doing Scotland down.\"",
        "The lawsuit cites the US constitution's emoluments clause, which says no federal official should receive a gift or a fee from a foreign government. The suit claims Mr Trump is \"flagrantly violating the constitution,\" Washington DC's attorney general said. It is the first such lawsuit filed by government entities. \"Never in the history of this country have we had a president with these kinds of extensive business entanglements or a president who refused to adequately distance himself from their holdings,\" Karl Racine, the District of Columbia attorney general said while announcing the lawsuit alongside Brian Frosh, Maryland's attorney general, on Monday. A non-governmental organisation, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, lodged a similar legal action in January. The Justice Department on Friday said those plaintiffs did not suffer in any way and there were no grounds for the suit. The department also said it was unconstitutional to sue the president in his official capacity. Mr Trump has not yet commented on the latest move. The constitutional challenges to Donald Trump's ongoing business ties as president just got some state-level muscle behind them. While the lawsuit by the District of Columbia and Maryland isn't the first attempt to force the president to more fully separate himself from his real-estate empire, the two governments bring a new level of legitimacy and resources. The first hurdle the states face is whether they have the proper legal grounds to file this case. Given that this is judicial terra incognita, there's no telling how the courts will react. There's never been a businessman-turned-president quite like Mr Trump, so there's never been a lawsuit quite like this one. If Maryland and DC are able to proceed, the case could turn out like many other Trump-related controversies, where the president's own words - and those of his associates - are used against him. While Mr Trump pledged to extricate himself from his day-to-day business operations, his son Eric has acknowledged he still gives his father regular financial updates. Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway also was recently reprimanded for praising daughter Ivanka's clothing line. Even in a best-case scenario for the president, this represents the latest in a growing list of legal headaches. Mr Trump is already contending with inquiries by congressional committees and a special prosecutor into his campaign's alleged links to Russia, which American intelligence agencies accuse of meddling in last November's US election in a bid to boost support for the property developer. Since taking office in January, Mr Trump has turned day-to-day control of his real estate empire and other assets over to a trust managed by his adult sons. But he has not sold them off as critics said he should do in order to avoid conflicts of interest. \"The emoluments clauses are a firewall against presidential corruption and the one thing we know about President Trump is he understands the value of walls,\" Mr Frosh said, referring to the president's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. \"This is one he can't climb over and one he can't dig underneath.\" The lawsuit will ask for a court injunction blocking Mr Trump from accepting foreign money. A list of Trump's potential conflicts The lawsuit is also seeking to access to his personal tax returns as part of the legal process known as discovery, according to US media. A key case in the dispute is Trump International Hotel in Washington DC, just down the road from the White House. Mr Trump opened the business last year by leasing a large building that used to be a central post office. The Trump Organization has said it would donate profits from customers who represent foreign governments to the Treasury department, but will not require those customers to identify themselves. According to the Washington Post, the lawsuit will detail examples of foreign governments favouring the president's hotel over others. It will cite how the Kuwaiti embassy planned to hold an event at a Four Seasons hotel, but eventually chose Trump International as the venue. Maryland and Washington are expected to argue that the Trump hotel also hurts competing hotels in their jurisdictions. The legal action will refer to Mr Trump's international hotels, golf courses and other commercial properties. The president's lawyers have argued the emoluments clause is intended only to stop federal officials from accepting a special consideration or gift from a foreign power and does not apply to payments such as a bill for a hotel room.

Khianni Gordon was jailed for life with a minimum of 19 years for murder while Kaneel Huggins and Antwon Clarke were given 10 and nine-year sentences respectively for manslaughter. Gordon, 18, was also convicted of perverting the course of justice. Clarke and Huggins' sentences were referred to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney General under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme. Huggins, 19, had his sentence increased to 16 years, and Clarke, 18, had his sentence increased to 15 years. Gordon's sentence was not considered by the court. Speaking after the hearing, Attorney General Jeremy Wright said: \"These offenders knowingly participated in the plan to assault and injure Wa'ays Dhaye knowing full well that really serious harm or death could be caused. \"Knife crime is a real scourge of our society and it's important that prison terms for this type of crime reflect the seriousness of the offending.\" Mr Dhaye, who was born in Holland but lived in Slough for 10 years, was stabbed while walking home after spending August bank holiday at the Notting Hill Carnival.

        "Brazil's Attorney-General, Rodrigo Janot, has asked the Supreme Court to open an investigation into Lula's alleged involvement in the multi-billion dollar scandal that has already seen dozens of lawmakers arrested. Here we look at the accusations in more detail and how the once popular ex-leader came to be linked to the allegations. At this stage, few details of the accusations against Lula are known as neither the Attorney-General's office nor the Supreme Court have made them public. What is certain is they are connected to Operation Car Wash, an investigation into a multi-billion dollar kickback scheme at state-oil company Petrobras. Investigators say that starting in 2003, construction companies formed a cartel to overcharge Petrobras for building contracts. They would then pay part of their windfall to Petrobras executives and politicians who were in on the deal. Prosecutors allege that the Workers' Party, of which both Lula and current President Dilma Rousseff are members, partly financed its campaigns and expenses through these kickbacks. Sao Paulo newspaper Folha quoted Attorney-General Janot as saying that the kickback scheme \"could never have functioned for so many years and in such a broad and aggressive form under the federal government without the participation of ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\" Lula, who governed from 2003 to 2011, has denied the allegations. At this stage, we do not know what the evidence against Lula is. Local media have reported that the Attorney-General has sent several folders of documents to the Supreme Court. Nor is it known what the exact charges against Lula could be. Newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo reports that Mr Janot would charge Lula with obstruction of justice. The newspaper says that the former leader is suspected of hampering Operation Car Wash, the investigation into corruption at Petrobras. According to the daily, the Attorney-General will cite President Rousseff's nomination of Lula as her chief of staff as evidence that Lula and Ms Rousseff tried to obstruct justice. Under Brazilian law, members of the cabinet can only be investigated by the country's highest court. Lula was sworn in as chief of staff in March, but a judge suspended the nomination within an hour, arguing that it was a move to shield Lula from possible prosecution by the federal judge investigating the Petrobras scandal. The country's Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether Lula will be able to take up his post or not. The Attorney-General's move is based on testimony given by Senator Delcidio do Amaral as part of a plea bargain, according to Brazilian media. Mr Amaral of the governing Workers' Party was arrested in November on charges of obstructing justice, the first sitting senator to be arrested in Brazilian history. He is accused of trying to help former Petrobras executive Nestor Cervero flee the country. Cervero was jailed for being the mastermind of the Petrobras corruption scandal. Mr Amaral has been collaborating with the authorities. His testimony also prompted the Attorney-General to request the launch of an investigation into former presidential candidate Aecio Neves. Mr Neves lost to Ms Rousseff in the 2014 presidential race. Yes, police took the ex-president for questioning on 4 March. The officers escorting Lula to the police station were acting under a judge's order called a \"conducao coercitiva\" (bench warrant) which means that a person is commanded to appear before authorities to give testimony. Police also searched his house in Sao Bernardo, the offices of the Lula Institute - a non-governmental organisation founded by the ex-leader - and the homes of some of his family members and associates. In total, 200 police officers enforced 33 search and 11 arrest warrants at locations in three Brazilian states. While the allegations were related to the Petrobras kickbacks scheme, they focussed specifically on two properties allegedly owned by Lula's family. Prosecutors alleged that Lula had received \"illicit benefits,\" such as having one of the construction firms involved in the Petrobras scandal renovate a luxury beachfront apartment and a ranch for his family. They said that \"the suspicion is that the improvements and the properties are bribes derived from the illegal gains made by OAS [construction firm] in the Petrobras graft scheme.\" Investigators said they also had evidence that in 2014 the ex-president received at least 270,000 (PS190,000) worth of furniture and improvements for the beachfront apartment in Guaruja. They said they were also looking into sums paid to Lula by construction firms involved in the scandal as donations or speaking fees. Lula denied any wrongdoing. Lula was the political mentor of current President Dilma Rousseff and remains close to Ms Rousseff, who nominated him as her chief of staff in March. Ms Rousseff is currently facing impeachment proceedings over allegations she manipulated government accounts prior to her re-election in 2014. But up until now, she has not been linked to the Petrobras corruption scandal, even though some of her critics have questioned how she could not have been aware of such a wide-ranging kickback scheme while she held a senior position at the oil giant. Ms Rousseff chaired the Petrobras board of directors from 2003 to 2010. If her close friend and mentor Lula were to be charged, pressure on the president would increase massively at an already difficult time in her political career,",

        "But do older people want any of this when many have not got to grips with the more basic technology most of the younger generation take for granted? Ian Hosking, an expert in design for the elderly at the University of Cambridge's engineering design centre, believes we need to get the basics right first. \"There are some very tech-savvy older people around, but there is clearly a large cohort of people who feel excluded by technology. They find it a bit impenetrable,\" he says. I would probably include my mother in that latter category. She is in her 80s and has made valiant efforts to get to grips with a wide range of technology, from a creaking hand-me-down computer to a Kindle and online shopping. Now, she wants to buy a tablet but is worried that she will not know how to use it. She is not alone - according to the US Pew Internet research centre, 77 of older people would need someone to help walk them through the process of setting up a new device. Aimed specifically at the older generation, Breezie offers a simplified interface for a standard Samsung Galaxy tablet. It can be customised to make sure it has the settings and apps the customer wants, rather than a bunch of preset ones they will never use. And the ones they do have are made easy to use - so, for example, someone wanting to use Skype simply has to tap on a friend's picture in the address book. Company founder Jeh Kazimi told BBC News Breezie had been inspired by his own mother. \"I watched her trying to navigate the internet and saw that she found it intimidating and complicated,\" he says. \"I couldn't find anything on the market that could make the internet work for her, so I created it myself.\" \"Our goal was to design software that makes the online environment considerably more accessible for people with little or no technological nous and to do so without patronising or limiting them.\" Users can give a trusted relative or friend the ability to sign-in remotely, set-up accounts and add contacts, via Breezie's support service. Last year it teamed up with Age UK to launch the tablet, which costs PS299 with the Breezie platform pre-installed. It is easy to assume that older people will find a gadget as simple to use as you do. As an iPad user, I saw no reason my mother could not get to grips with it - but, actually, it is not as simple as that. The response time for icons on an Apple screen is 0.7 seconds, but the over-65s have a response time of about one second. Using touchscreens may come naturally enough to a toddler but not necessarily for an older person - the nerves in the finger become less sensitive with age, meaning older people may \"touch\" far more heavily. And tests suggest that if an older person has a slight tremor, it can be registered on a device as a swipe rather than a touch. \"It is these subtle issues that erode confidence and cause confusion,\" says Chris Bignell, a spokesman for Emporia Telecom, which has designed a smartphone specifically for older people. Its phone comes with an app that offers tutorials for people to practise using a touchscreen. It also has a custom-built detachable keypad that flips over the phone, for those who still want buttons. Increasingly, tech firms, including a glut of Chinese manufacturers, are developing hardware with age and disability in mind. It might mean larger buttons, extra-loud speakers, hearing-aid compatibility or longer battery life. Some - such as Age UK's OwnFone - offer a completely stripped-back mobile that only sends and receives calls - while others aim to address specific needs. The Doro PhoneEasy has large print and big buttons, while the Binatone Speakeasy comes with a built-in panic button. But to many older people, these handsets can seem unnecessarily old-fashioned and somewhat patronising, according to Prof Hosking. \"They don't deal holistically with the problems of ageing, because often older people have multiple impairments,\" he says. With a rising elderly population, the technology industry cannot afford to ignore the issue. It is estimated that, by 2030, 19 of the US population will be over 65 - roughly the same proportion that currently own iPhones. And by 2050, there will be one retired person for every two that are in work. Apple is looking to address this - but not with new hardware. In a joint venture with IBM, it announced last month it would design \"iPad apps\" that would be \"very easy to use for seniors.\" Aimed at the Japanese market, the apps will help connect millions of older people with healthcare services. \"It assumes that its product is inherently usable,\" says Mr Hosking. The Speaking Exchange is a US initiative that connects retired people living in care homes with students learning English in Brazil, via Skype. A YouTube video of the service in action shows the older people clearly look forward to the chats, the Brazilian youngsters improve their English and both have developed strong bonds. The UK offers a similar service - Cloud Grannies - which puts retired people in touch with children in India. In the end, my mother decided to buy herself an iPad. For years, my suggestion that my mother should get a tablet has fallen on deaf ears. Then, her trusty old PC broke, a friend sang the praises of her own tablet, and the next thing I know, she is Facetiming me.",
        "The powdery white beaches of Zanzibar's east coast are best known as a holiday destination. But each day, as the tide begins to ebb and the beachgoers return to their hotels, a small army of men and women armed with sticks and spears wade out across the coastal flats in search of one of the Tanzanian island's finest delicacies - octopus. During a single low tide a skilled octopus hunter can spear more than 10 of the slimy invertebrates, which thrive amid the maze of rocks, corals and sea grass that lie beyond the beaches. The catch is highly prized by the island's tourist hotels and provides an important source of protein for coastal communities. Protected by an offshore reef, the tidal flats off the island's east coast provide livelihoods and sustenance for local residents, in the form of fish, crabs, shellfish, seaweed and octopus. Tanzania is the largest producer of octopus in the western Indian Ocean. Abdullah Ali, 35, prepares to launch his traditional wooden boat on an octopus hunting expedition from Dongwe village. Traditionally a female-dominated activity, more men are now turning to octopus for a source of income. \"The octopus has helped me to drive my life forward,\" said Ali, who makes about PS1.90 (2.30) per kg (2lb 3oz) for his octopuses. According to data from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, catches in Tanzania have increased from 482 tonnes in 1990 to more than 1,250 in 2012. The mix of jagged rocks and corals near the reef offer many places for the octopuses to hide at low tide, becoming almost invisible to the untrained eye. Thousands of sea urchins provide a further challenge. Mariam, an octopus hunter from Bwejuu village, plunges into the water to cool off after a morning's work. Mama Juma, a seasoned octopus hunter, scans the crystal clear water near Paje beach for likely octopus hideouts. A lone woman searches for octopus in the evening beyond a seaweed farm at Bwejuu. Local communities derive much of their livelihood from the intertidal flats. Grilled octopus is a staple at the nightly seafood market in Stone Town. Most of mainland Tanzania's octopus catch is exported to Europe, but on the island of Zanzibar tourism has provided a booming market.",
        "Bakewell man Stephen Downing was convicted in 1974 for killing Wendy Sewell but that was overturned in 2002. Chris Clark said he has uncovered a crucial pathology report showing she was strangled, which was never told to the jury. The Home Office said it would send any new criminal evidence to the police. Evidence of police misconduct would be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the Home Office added. Derbyshire police said the case was closed after a reinvestigation in 2002. Mr Clark, a retired Norfolk police officer, said he has sent his findings to the Home Office after obtaining the original pathology report last month. He said he believed the report showed Mrs Sewell had clear signs of being strangled. She was found battered in a Bakewell cemetery in 1973 and died in hospital two days later. Mr Downing admitted beating her with a pickaxe handle but later retracted that statement, only to be found guilty by a jury. \"I'm reporting the facts as I see them. The pathologist had evidence in his report that could have exonerated Stephen Downing,\" Mr Clark said. He said the pathologist's report showed bruising on her neck consistent with a \"knotted ligature\" used to garrotte her and a rash in her lungs and airways, possibly caused by strangulation. Mr Clark said none of this was used in Mr Downing's trial. He added the evidence may mean her death was linked to the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe. Mr Downing was 17 at the time of Mrs Sewell's murder but was assessed as having a mental age of 11. His father Ray Downing and Matlock Mercury editor Don Hale campaigned for his release and in 2002 the Court of Appeal found his conviction unsafe because of \"procedural reasons.\" Mr Hale said the pathology report directly conflicted with the evidence the police presented at the time and called for an independent investigation into the murder. \"This information was available within two or three days of Mr Downing being arrested and it completely contradicts this so-called confession,\" he said. But Derbyshire police said the murder was reinvestigated following the quashing of the conviction and it considered the matter closed. \"All possible lines of inquiry were exhausted during the re-investigation. Twenty two people were ruled out of the enquiry but officers were unable to eliminate Stephen Downing as a suspect,\" a spokeswoman said. She added there was no evidence to suggest Peter Sutcliffe - the Yorkshire Ripper - was involved.",
        "An investigation into Pembrokeshire council's dealings with Michael Smith said it was \"only luck\" that stopped his application. The 2015 review was confidential, but a copy of the report has been exclusively obtained by the Western Telegraph. It revealed a head of service initially failed to provide information of child protection concerns about Smith. Pembrokeshire council said \"it is unfortunate that a member of the authority has seen fit to disclose the report, contrary to advice.\" Smith, from Haverfordwest, was employed as a youth worker for the council between May 2001 and January 2012. During that time he was the subject of three disciplinary hearings. Allegations against him included allowing a child to sit on his lap and drive his Land Rover, allowing a child to sit in his Land Rover without wearing a seatbelt, and a young person, who had been reported missing by their foster carer, had shown up at his home. The report, which was compiled by an independent social worker, said Smith \"displayed many grooming behaviours during the years he was employed by Pembrokeshire council but there were no direct allegations of abuse during this time.\" Smith was dismissed for gross misconduct and in September 2013 a police investigation began after he was accused of sexually abusing a boy. He was jailed for six years in July 2014 after admitting sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13, inciting the child to engage in sexual activity and taking indecent photographs of the child. He also admitted possessing 1,136 indecent images of children. The report said in 2010 Smith had applied to Pembrokeshire council to become a respite foster carer. The fostering team wrote to the Head of Youth Service for his views on Smith's application. The report said the head of service had \"replied in very positive terms.\" A formal reference form which the head of service was sent asked him to \"highlight any concerns\" regarding Smith's employment, including any disciplinary proceedings and the outcomes. The head of service left the section blank. It was not until the papers were distributed to the foster panel that one of the members recalled Smith had been investigated previously for inappropriate behaviour with children and had been disciplined. The panel concluded Smith was not suitable for approval to be a foster carer. \"By withholding relevant information and leaving the section of the form blank, the foster panel might have concluded that there had been no concerns and no disciplinary action,\" the report said. \"It was only chance that a member of the fostering panel recollected the safeguarding investigation in 2005\" and \"only luck that prevented Smith from being approved as a foster carer.\" There have been calls to make the report public. The latest request took place at full council on 2 March when Cllr Mike Stoddart had put forward a notice of motion asking for it to be published. He said it is in \"the public interest to publish the report so that the electorate can be fully apprised of the chain of events surrounding this issue.\" His motion was defeated by a single vote. A statement from Pembrokeshire council said: \"The report contains personal information in relation to children, parents and professionals, and the report was made available to members on this basis. Further publication of this report was restricted. \"On making the report available to all members, they were made aware that there are families in the area who remain affected by the actions of Mr Smith, and were reminded of their corporate obligation to safeguard everyone in the community.\"",
        "Transport Minister John Hayes said he was satisfied the local council would be financially protected in a proposed Compulsory Purchase Order. And he has paved the way for a search and rescue helicopter service to return to the airport - which closed last year - \"when\" it opens. But the airport's new owners, Trevor Cartner and Chris Musgrave, claim his statements breached election rules. After 30 March, the general election pending period prevents the government from making announcements about new or controversial matters. Mr Cartner and Mr Musgrave said the timing of his statement was \"a disgrace\" and Mr Hayes as Transport Minister \"should have exercised an element of impartiality and objectivity.\" \"We are now taking legal advice with a view to making a formal complaint to the Electoral Commission,\" they added. Mr Hayes described his announcements as \"huge steps towards securing Manston's future as a working airport.\" Dr Beau Webber, of the Save Manston Airport Campaign, said: \"This means Manston has a chance.... we have good people who want to put good jobs in place for Thanet.\" The airport closed in May 2014, seven months after being bought by Stagecoach Group co-founder Ann Gloag. A majority stake was sold to Mr Cartner and Mr Musgrave for redevelopment several months later but the nature of the sale and the true ownership of the airport was called into question by a recent Commons Transport Select Committee. Financial risk The government has supported a \"five point plan\" to reopen the airport, including compulsory purchase of the site. However, there has been concern about the financial indemnities offered by RiverOak - the US firm interested in buying and running the airport. But Mr Hayes said on Thursday that he was \"satisfied by the indemnity offered by RiverOak to protect the council against the costs of the Compulsory Purchase Order.\" RiverOak's Stephen DeNardo welcomed the news and said it remained \"absolutely committed to reviving Manston as an operational airport.\" Bristow, the company that provides search-and-rescue services for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, had originally planned to base two helicopters at Manston. The government has now announced that instead of agreeing a long-term contract for Bristow to base its helicopters elsewhere, it has agreed a one-year deal to temporarily base them at Lydd Airport, also in Kent. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP also support the reopening of Manston Airport but have criticised the way the Conservatives have handled the issue.",
        "Australian Matthews, 25, of Orica-BikeExchange won a sprint finish ahead of Peter Sagan and Edvald Boasson Hagen to claim his first Tour victory. Slovak Sagan took the green points jersey from Briton Mark Cavendish. Defending champion Froome finished in the peloton, nine minutes 39 seconds behind Matthews, on the 197km stage from Escaldes-Engordany to Revel. Britain's Adam Yates, Matthews' 23-year-old team-mate, was in the same group to keep the white jersey for best young rider. 2013 and 2015 winner Froome and his main rivals enjoyed a relatively comfortable day, which started with a big climb but flattened out to suit a breakaway win. The main contenders for the yellow jersey were happy to let a group of 15 riders - none of whom threatened the overall lead - surge ahead. Britain's Steve Cummings, who won stage seven, was part of the breakaway but dropped back as two Orica team-mates helped Matthews earn an emotional win. Matthews said he came close to \"giving up\" on the Tour de France after breaking four ribs in a crash last year, and missing the 2014 race following an accident. But his win continued Orica's impressive Tour, with Yates second in the general classification standings, 16 seconds behind Froome. While Yates has produced some superb solo performances, Matthews was helped by team-mates Luke Durbridge and Daryl Impey as they neutralised the threat of Tinkoff's world champion Sagan. Durbridge's pace reduced the breakaway to seven riders before he dropped out, with Impey launching several attacks in the last few kilometres. Matthews waited until the final 200m to make his move, overtaking BMC's Greg van Avermaet and Sagan in the last 50m. \"To have won a stage after two really bad years in the Tour de France, the emotion is just sinking in,\" said Matthews, who has also won stages at the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana. \"I was close to giving up on this race, thinking it was maybe not for me, but today was incredible. \"It was never the plan to go in the breakaway. We were hoping for bunch sprint after the last climb but we had strong guys, and whoever is up we give them 110. Daryl and Luke gave me everything.\" Sagan overtook Cavendish in the green jersey standings after winning the intermediate sprint and finishing second to Matthews. Cavendish, who has won three stages in this year's race, finished in the peloton and now trails Sagan by 38 points. Sagan has won the green jersey in each of the past four years, and Manxman Cavendish, 31, said before this year's race that he cannot beat the world champion. Cavendish, whose tally of 29 career stage wins is bettered only by Eddy Merckx's 34, could challenge for a 30th on a largely flat stage 11, which takes the riders 162.5km (101 miles) from Carcassonne to Montpellier. 1.

        "BP described the withdrawal as a \"precautionary measure,\" adding that it would monitor the security situation. The Foreign Office withdrew British embassy staff from the capital, Tripoli, last week. Gunmen have besieged the justice and foreign ministries recently, demanding that Gaddafi-era officials be expelled. The gunmen blocked the buildings two weeks ago, parking pick-up trucks with anti-aircraft guns outside. The siege was lifted by Sunday and employees at both ministries were back at work. Parliament passed a law last week barring Gaddafi-era officials from political office. BP said in a statement: \"Following FCO advice given to us by the British Embassy in Tripoli, and purely as a precautionary measure, we have brought non-essential overseas staff out of Libya for the time being in a phased reduction of numbers. \"Our Libyan staff remain and the office continues to operate. Fewer than a dozen people are affected. \"We will continue to monitor the security situation and move people back in to Libya when it is considered safe to do so.\" On Friday, the Foreign Office said some embassy staff in Libya had been withdrawn in response to \"ongoing political uncertainty.\" It said it was temporarily withdrawing a \"small number\" who work with Libyan ministries, while the UK embassy remains \"open as usual,\" including for consular and visa services. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential travel to Tripoli and against all travel to other parts of Libya, such as the eastern city of Benghazi.",
        "The verdict came from the Care Quality Commission's first inspection since the University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust was created in November. The hospital was at the centre of a PS6m public inquiry into care failings. But despite the CQC's overall finding being critical, the trust said it was \"highly complimentary\" about the standard of care in some areas. Inspectors visited County Hospital, formerly Stafford Hospital, and Royal Stoke University Hospital, also run by the trust, in April. They carried out unannounced inspections in May. Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which ran Stafford, was dissolved in November after a report concluded it was not \"clinically or financially sustainable.\" 700,000 People served by the hospital trust 194,954 Combined AE visits to the two hospitals (2013-14) 1,508 Beds provided across the two sites 8,848 Equivalent full-time staff employed by the trust The NHS in Staffordshire was given almost PS300m to create the new trust and relocate some services in the county. The CQC said it recognised \"that the leadership of the new trust has had the significant task of bringing together two organisations at a challenging time. We have seen that progress has been made but there is still more to be achieved.\" The trust was rated as good overall for how caring its services were, but told it required improvement to ensure safe, effective and well-led services. It received an inadequate rating in relation to whether services were responsive. Several initiatives within children and young people's services at Stoke were rated as outstanding in relation to whether they were caring. Outstanding work was also seen in the specialised neurological unit at County Hospital, inspectors said. But the trust was told it must address high waiting times in its emergency department, and inspectors noted the Royal Stoke had \"consistently and frequently failed the four-hour waiting time target.\" It also said the trust should review capacity and adequacy of critical care services, and communication between senior management and frontline staff. Mark Hackett, trust chief executive, said: \"Less than a year ago there were serious concerns about the sustainability, and therefore the safety, of services at County Hospital, but the CQC has now given the hospital 23 good ratings and just one inadequate rating.\" He said the trust was addressing the areas for improvement the CQC identified.",
        "The Twickenham crowd watched England run in three tries within eight second-half minutes as the home side ran out comprehensive 38-21 winners. Their previous biggest win over New Zealand was 13-0 at Twickenham in January 1936, while the most points they had ever registered against the All Blacks was the 31 they scored at the same venue in November 2002. Only once in 498 Tests had New Zealand been beaten by a bigger margin (28-7). So, what have the pundits got to say about an England victory which very few saw coming? \"I can probably see this being maybe the greatest ever England victory, ever, at Twickenham. Nothing is springing to mind where they have annihilated the world's best team as they have today. \"I think I have been to every single England game at Twickenham since I was 14. This was by far the best game I've seen. \"It's the best performance by an England side considering the opposition and considering what this team has been through, particularly over the last two weeks. This was absolutely magnificent. \"Not only has this got to be the greatest game I've seen England play at Twickenham, we've got to put this among one of the world's greatest upsets, maybe even in any sport. Media playback is not supported on this device \"It was an absolutely astonishing performance to win by 17 points. England harried, hounded and were just relentless. They said to New Zealand'We will tackle you wherever you go and then we'll pinch the ball and see if we can live off scraps'. New Zealand cracked. \"It has been England's day - this is not about today not being New Zealand's day. England have put New Zealand under pressure and they defended not only for their lives but for the 80,000 people inside Twickenham and the millions watching at home. It has been relentless and they gave everything, epitomised by man of the match Tom Wood. \"People stepped up. Individuals stepped up one to 15, not just the odd player, particularly in that second half. It was wave after wave of England, whether it was defence or attack. That was the difference.\" Matt Dawson was speaking on BBC Radio 5 live. \"It was a fantastic Test match played with great energy. This England team has had a lot of flak over the past couple of weeks and they've got a lot of pride back in the shirt. \"The crowd just buzzed off it and it was wonderful to be here. \"What I liked about the start was that when England walked on the field there wasn't a lot of song and dance about it, they knew they had to do a job and they took the game to New Zealand. \"I said beforehand, if you're going to beat the best teams in the world, indeed become the best in the world, you've got to have self-belief and for me they played with that self-belief today. They took the game to New Zealand and deserved the victory. Media playback is not supported on this device \"Looking at the first half, New Zealand will rue a couple of those missed penalties but psychologically England just built it and built it. \"There was still room to improve - Ashton missed an opportunity in the corner, Tuilagi forced the ball - but this team today gelled. They got opportunities and took them - to me that's what Test match rugby is about. \"It's very easy to look back at the past but England's 31-28 win against the All Blacks in 2002 was the day we actually said'we are the top team in the world'. It was a massive transformation from which England then built for the next few years. \"Hopefully we'll look back at this day not just as a great day for English rugby, but the day this team really grew up.\" Josh Lewsey was speaking on BBC Three. \"Absolutely unbelievable. Not just to get the victory, but the best victory England have ever had against the All Blacks. No-one saw it coming, but maybe this England team did. \"They played absolutely magnificently well, not just scoring penalties to build the score in the first half, but try after try in the second half. It was quite extraordinary. \"Chris Robshaw was a hero - he deserves all the credit he will get. In the same way England were lambasted in defeat, when they play well - which they did, they were heroic - they should take a huge round of applause. \"They got themselves 15-0 up and then conceded two soft tries, but the way they came back at New Zealand was so impressive. \"The All Blacks looked shell-shocked at the end.\" Lawrence Dallaglio was speaking on BBC Three \"It was a fantastic win. It was a great to be there, one of best games I ever seen at Twickenham. \"It was the All Blacks against England who were coming off two average defeats. The scoreline reflected the performance. It was a great day for England. \"I think because it was the last of the games in the series and what happened in the match means it was a David versus Goliath effort. \"England got stuck into New Zealand early on and they were rattled. A key point was when Conrad Smith came flying out and England went through. \"New Zealand never recovered from that. It was a great, great victory for England.\" Sir Clive Woodward was speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek",

Aaron Howe, RSPB reserves project manager, said: \"The rain has helped flush out virtually all of the salt and the marsh will recover, but the project has been delayed.\" The 125-acre marsh at Snape is an extension to the existing 70-acre reserve. The reserve at Hollesley was not flooded, but the RSPB was hoping to formally open it on the same day as it opened Snape.",
        "Choity Khatun, who is three, was born with caudal twinning, meaning that part of a twin had developed in her pelvis. Australian surgeons spent months working out how to remove the extra limb and reconstruct her pelvic area. The toddler was brought to Australia from her village in Bangladesh by a charity, Children First Foundation. Dr Chris Kimber, head of surgery at Monash Children's Hospital in Victoria, said Choity's case was very rare and the surgery had been \"daunting.\" \"The operation is sort of determined by the individual and you have to spend a lot of time trying to analyse what's there and then plan a procedure that takes that into account,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The Australian team held extensive discussions with doctors in Bangladesh, who had already performed some surgery. The team had to determine whether further surgery was even possible or beneficial before she was brought to Australia last year. Doctors in Bangladesh had removed part of the leg \"but she was still left with a large mass sitting there in her pelvis between her two normal legs,\" Dr Kimber said. \"Because there's part of a twin in there, she had two rectums, two vaginas, potentially two anuses - double bits that were growing into a very abnormal area.\" After a lengthy planning process, the team embarked on the surgery in November. They removed the part of the leg that was left behind and carried out reconstruction work to ensure the little girl was continent - something that will help her to function much better back at home. Dr Kimber said the toddler, who is partially blind, was now walking and running around, and had put on weight. He said she might need further corrective surgery during her teenage years but would be able to return home to Bangladesh with her mother \"without medication or surgical aids.\" Her mother, Shima Khatun, told Australian media on Thursday she was looking forward to going home to her family and watching her daughter play. \"Everything is good now... she can play like other babies... she is the same [as them],\" she said.",

        "Michael Patterson was handed the order after being convicted of break-ins in the Levenshulme and Longsight areas of the city. His \"consistent method\" was to carry out burglaries after entering rear alleyways, magistrates heard. The 49-year-old, of Field Bank Grove, Gorton admitted three counts of burglary and possession of a Class B drug and was jailed for 16 months. The ban, known as a criminal behaviour order, will run indefinitely after his release. It will ban Patterson from entering rear alleyways with the exception of the one behind his own home. The order also prohibits him from entering an area of Stockport Road, from Stanley Grove in Longsight up to Albert Road in Levenshulme, and the surrounding streets. Premises targeted in the break-ins included a takeaway, a solicitors' office and a mobile phone shop. Nigel Murphy, Manchester City Council's executive member for neighbourhood services, said: \"Michael Patterson has used the same technique repeatedly to commit a number of offences and this order will prevent him continuing the pattern.\"",

        "Luciano Spalletti's side started the day four points behind Juve, and were without forward Mohamed Salah, at the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt. They needed Wojciech Szczesny to make a good early save from Diego Laxalt. Genoa then lost keeper Mattia Perin to injury, and went behind as Izzo diverted in a Bruno Peres shot. It was the defender's second Serie A own goal of the season, having also scored a winner at the wrong end when Genoa lost to city rivals Sampdoria in October. Perin injured himself making a brilliant reaction stop to deny Roma's top scorer Edin Dzeko - bringing more frustration for the goalkeeper, who was making his return from suspension after being sent off against Palermo in his last match. Szczesny, on loan from Arsenal, was inspired in goal at the other end, somehow keeping the ball out at his near post in the first half after Nikola Ninkovic's free-kick had been deflected through a crowd, then making a flying stop from Lucas Ocampos right at the end. Juventus can re-establish a four-point advantage by beating Bologna in Sunday's late match (19:45 GMT). Lazio strengthened their hold on fourth place with an unconvincing 1-0 victory over next-to-bottom Crotone, with Ciro Immobile scoring the winner in the last minute. Lucas Biglia hit the bar with a first-half penalty for the Biancocelesti, but Crotone were desperately unlucky when Marcus Rohden had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside with 20 minutes to go. England goalkeeper Joe Hart began 2017 with a clean sheet as Torino drew 0-0 at Sassuolo in a forgettable game. The most significant moment was the return, as a substitute, of Sassuolo's highly rated Italy Under-21 forward Domenico Berardi after more than four months out with a knee injury. Alejandro Gomez scored twice in the first 23 minutes as Atalanta lifted their hopes of Europa League qualification with a convincing 4-1 win at Chievo, with Andrea Conti and Remo Freuler also on target. Two goals from Ivan Perisic gave Inter Milan a fourth successive Serie A win, as they won 2-1 at Udinese in Sunday's early kick-off. AC Milan had a late strike from Colombia striker Carlos Bacca to thank for a 1-0 win over Cagliari that allowed them to leapfrog Atalanta into fifth and to within six points of the summit.

        "The controversial bonfire is in a public car park at Ravenscroft Avenue, off the Newtownards Road. It is one of four Belfast bonfires that are the subject of court injunctions, sought to prevent them getting bigger. Meanwhile, police are investigating complaints about \"distasteful\" materials placed on bonfires. Traditionally, bonfires are lit in many loyalist areas of Northern Ireland on the Eleventh Night of July. They mark the start of the annual commemoration of William of Orange's victory over King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. However, some bonfires have caused controversy because they are built close to family homes and pose a risk to health and safety. On Tuesday, Sinn Fein's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill said the burning of flags and election posters on bonfires was a \"hate crime.\" She called on the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to take steps against the practice. \"Once again, we have witnessed bonfires across the north being festooned with stolen Sinn Fein election posters, Irish national flags and other emblems,\" she said. \"The theft and burning of posters from any party as well as flags, effigies and other symbols is not culture, it is a hate crime.\" John Finucane, who ran unsuccessfully for Sinn Fein in the June general election, has said the Orange Order needed to do more to address the burning of flags and posters on bonfires. Speaking after his election posters appeared on a bonfire near Conway Street in Belfast, Mr Finucane said it was \"wrong\" and \"a hate crime.\" Pictures have also emerged on social media of a bonfire in east Belfast draped with a banner carrying a racist message directed at Celtic footballer Scott Sinclair. In a statement, the PSNI said: \"Police are investigating complaints about various materials, some of which are clearly distasteful, placed on the bonfire. \"Where police are aware of a crime being committed, an investigation will follow. \"We take hate crime very seriously and actively investigate all incidents reported to us,\" it added. The Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said: \"Bonfires on the Eleventh Night have long been part of the unionist culture. \"Those who have waged a campaign of demonisation against such celebrations should dial down the rhetoric. \"To those who build bonfires, I urge them to not play into the hands of those who want to demonise the culture - they should be respectful of their neighbours. \"Endangering property and lives should not be a concern for residents on the Eleventh Night,\" she added. Progressive Unionist Party councillor John Kyle said there are \"real issues with some bonfires\" and steps need to be taken when property and lives are put at risk. But he added: \"Let's see the broader picture - if we are going to create a future that is peaceful, that is prosperous, then there needs to be respect. \"Two of the major casualties of the past 18 months have been trust and respect, there is now no trust, or very little trust, between unionism and republicanism or nationalism. \"There is very little respect being felt, particularly by loyalists, they feel continually disrespected and undermined,\" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, fire crews dealt with a large bonfire in Carrickfergus in County Antrim that was set alight prematurely. Assistant chief fire officer Alan Walmsley said firefighters were called to the scene at about 05:30 BST on Tuesday. On Tuesday morning, staff from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) boarded up the windows of five homes near the Ravenscroft Avenue bonfire. A NIHE spokesman said the five houses were privately owned, but its staff had stepped in to protect the properties. The Ravenscroft Avenue site hit the headlines last month when it was reported that young men involved in building the bonfire had closed off the public car park. The bonfire was set alight prematurely last week and the fire service attended to protect nearby homes and property from damage.",

        "Media playback is not supported on this device Ulster twice opened a seven-point lead through tries by wing Craig Gilroy and full-back Jared Payne. In a week when the Welsh Rugby Union announced they intend to take over the region, Dragons hit back with scores by Rynard Landman and Ollie Griffiths. Paddy Jackson's kick edged Ulster ahead before Rodney Ah You was shown a red card and Andrew claimed the key try. Ah You was dismissed after he was adjudged to have made an illegal shoulder charge on Dragons full-back Carl Meyer. The win means Ulster stay fourth in the Pro12 table, but their failure to gain a bonus point means fifth-placed Scarlets have reduced their cushion to three points with four matches remaining. Playing for the last time this season at Rodney Parade, Dragons were dominated in the early stages and were seven points down within 10 minutes thanks to Ruan Pienaar's vision and Gilroy's footwork. The South African scrum half's kick into space bounced horribly for the defenders and Gilroy dribbled the ball into space and touched down near the posts. The Welsh region dominated possession for the rest of the half, at one stage going through 32-phases, but never really looking likely to score a try. O'Brien's penalty was cancelled out by Pienaar with Carl Meyer' long-range penalty off target to leave Ulster with a seven-point half-time lead. A debatable yellow card for Gilroy gave the Dragons a bridgehead which Landman turned into points with a rumbling lineout drive. O'Brien's conversion levelled the scores. But before the Ulster wing had returned to the field of play full-back Payne cut a clever line to cross for his side's second try. Dragons, in 10th-place in the table, again hit back with flanker Griffiths charging down a clearance and being given the benefit of considerable double and awarded the try after several TV replays. Jackson's penalty with eight minutes remaining edged Ulster back ahead before Ah You' careless challenge reduced his team to 14-men with six minutes remaining. Ulster rallied and kicked for the corner with Andrew claiming the crucial try from the driving lineout.

All five of the victims were on the open, upper deck of the boat, but were not wearing life jackets, regional coroner Matt Brown told a news conference. The other passengers were all in an enclosed part of the boat. Officials have said more of the 27 people on board could have died had it not been for the \"amazing response\" from locals around Tofino. A 27-year-old Australian man from Sydney is still missing after the accident on Sunday afternoon. The Down's Syndrome Association described Stephen Thomas as \"a very talented young man and a gifted photographer.\" Chief executive Carol Boys said: \"We were all delighted when Stephen's beautiful image'Moraine Lake' won the national'My Perspective' photographic competition last year.\" She added that David Thomas was one of the driving forces behind the Swindon Down's Syndrome Group where he was a trustee. Isambard Community School in Swindon also paid tribute to former pupil Stephen. Headteacher Sue Banks said he was \"always a positive role model for others - he never used the term'I can't' and was constantly smiling.\" She said he had a love for art and his work was regularly exhibited in the school and sold at the annual art show. David Thomas worked for Microsoft. A statement from the company said they were \"shocked and saddened\" to hear the news. Michel Van der Bel, Microsoft UK general manager, said: \"Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with their family, friends and David's colleagues and we will be doing everything we can to support them.\" Mr Slater's family said he was a retired navy engineer from Toronto, who had lived in Canada for over 30 years and had three daughters. He was on the boat with his wife, Marjorie, who is being treated in hospital. His daughter Michele Slater Brown wrote on Facebook he was \"larger than life, a charmer, handsome, entrepreneur, engineer in the Navy.... he was our dad, our lovely dad, I will miss him forever but I'm grateful for all the times I spent with him, I love you dad.\" Ms Taylor was also a British ex-pat living in the ski resort of Whistler. Corene Inouye, director of operations at Jamie's Whaling Station and Adventure Centre, the company that owns the boat, said: \"It appears the incident happened so quickly that the crew didn't have an opportunity to send out a Mayday.\" She added the skipper of the ship has more than 20 years' whale-watching experience and had completed 18 years with the company. Company owner Jamie Bray said passengers on the boat were not required to wear life jackets as it has enclosed compartments, which would be difficult to exit in the event of a sinking. Another whale-watching boat operated by the same company capsized in 1998, killing two people, including the boat operator and a tourist from Germany. Greg Louie, chief councillor of the Ahousaht First Nation Elected Council, told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme that \"possibly everyone\" could have drowned or died of hypothermia had the local community not responded to the accident so quickly. The incident could have been \"a lot worse,\" Lt Cmdr Desmond James of the Canadian Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre in British Columbia said. He added that 21 people would not have been rescued were it not for the \"amazing response\" by locals. Australian Associated Press reported the missing 27-year-old Sydney man was on the boat with his girlfriend and her family when it sank. British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said his thoughts were with the family and friends of those affected by Sunday's incident. Canadian prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the deaths.",
        "When the Red Lion in Northmoor was put up for sale last year, locals formed the Northmoor Lion Ltd, secured a loan and bought the pub in November 2013. Since then, 70 people have bought company shares, raising about PS300,000. Parish council chairman Graham Shelton said the community was \"very excited\" after six-months of hard work. \"Northmoor has proved that if there is an energetic group of people that want to get things done, you can get things done,\" he added. \"When the pub came on the market, we feared we'd lose it. Alongside the church and village hall, it's greatly valued by local people and is at the heart of our community.\" Previous owners Greene King put the pub up for sale at the beginning of the year after failing to find new tenants. Mr Shelton said villagers explored \"making it a community asset\" but decided to buy it after securing a loan from \"a private individual.\" The pub will now be run as a free house and Mr Shelton said the company had been \"overwhelmed\" with the response to an advertisement for tenants. It will be run by first-time landlords Ian Neale and Lisa Lyne, who have 30 years' industry experience between them. Mr Shelton added that the couple \"ticked all the boxes\" for the local community, including \"experience, capability, friendliness and empathy.\" He added: They] will enable us to regenerate our pub, which has been in continuous existence since the 1700s.\" \"They have the whole village behind them.\"",
        "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a charity worker accused of security offences - was detained while trying to leave the country with her baby daughter after visiting relatives in April 2016. Her family denies she broke any laws. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who is from London, said his wife's detention was a \"stain\" on Iran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, who works for the charity the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has been detained in Iran since her arrest last year. The couple's two-year-old daughter has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport, and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family said in September that a Revolutionary Court had handed down the five-year term. She was accused of allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, but the official charges against her were not made public. According to Mr Ratcliffe, his wife's appeal was dismissed in a secret hearing of an Iranian Revolutionary Court on 4 January but only announced on 22 January. In a statement, her husband said the precise charges against her remain secret, but that two new accusations were made at her appeal. One was that she had been head of recruitment for the BBC's Farsi service when it was launched in 2009. Her family say she worked on a BBC training project for youth in Afghanistan and Iran, but never worked for BBC Farsi. The other charge was that she was married to a British spy. Mr Ratcliffe is an accountant. Monique Villa, chief executive of Thomson Reuters Foundation said she is \"outraged by this new mockery of justice,\" and reiterated Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe never worked for BBC Farsi and that her husband \"is not a spy but a reputable accountant.\" \"I am fully convinced of Nazanin's innocence,\" she added. Francesca Unsworth, BBC World Service Group director, said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had briefly worked for charity BBC Media Action in a \"junior administrative capacity\" but had never worked for BBC Persian. \"In any case, to suggest that being employed by BBC Persian is tantamount to'acting against national security' is patently ludicrous,\" Ms Unsworth added. Mr Ratcliffe said: \"The lack of justice in Nazanin's case continues to be a stain on Iran. The continued attempt to frame Nazanin behind secrets and lies brings shame. \"It is a needless waste of a mother and child's life for their own political bargains and economic interests.\" Iran does not recognize dual nationalities, meaning those detained cannot receive consular assistance. Since her imprisonment, her family have campaigned on her behalf, highlighting her deteriorating health while in jail and her anguish at her separation from her daughter.",

        "The Manchester-born full-back has admitted previously that moving closer to his family was a temptation. But he this week agreed a new three-year contract to remain at Pittodrie. \"It was definitely a big factor in me signing,\" the right-back said of McInnes' decision. \"It was nice to re-assured that he would be the manager.\" Logan, 29, joined the Scottish Premiership club from Brentford in May 2014 and had been linked with a move back to England. \"It was always a temptation,\" he said. \"My family's down there, my friends are down there, but at the end of the day it is about enjoying football and being happy and I am more than happy here. \"Family has never been an issue. The manager gives me more than enough time to see the kiddies and I can arrange for them all to come up and spend time with their dad up here. \"So it is probably a stage of my career where I thought a three-year deal at club where I've been for three and a half years it suited me down to the ground. \"It would have been difficult signing under a manager I had never played under.\" McInnes paid tribute to Logan for the way he has handled his family situation. \"Shay's not had it easy because of that,\" he said. \"His own situation domestically is a huge commitment for him to see his kids. \"But that's another positive of Shay Logan - how committed he is to his family and his children - but at no point does he lack that commitment to us. \"He gets quality time with his kids, but he also brings us the necessary work to prepare for a game. \"He never misses training. He's consistently fit and available and he's chalked up a lot of games. He is a fantastic boy to work with.\" McInnes also praised Logan's quality as a player. \"It's important that we try to retain good players, players that have served us well and there's no doubt that Shay, from day one, has impressed us all,\" he added. \"A lot is made of his personality, his confidence and rightly so and I think the fans are drawn to that. \"But what also has to be said is that he is a very good player and he's been voted the best right-back in the league in the last few seasons and rightly so. \"He has been a brilliant signing and I'm delighted he has shown that commitment to be with us.\"",

        "The 35-year-old has been released by Brighton Hove Albion after they fell short in their bid for promotion. \"Maybe if I drop down a division, I'll not feature, but it's ifs, buts and maybes,\" the defender said of his international future. \"It is up to me to keep fit and keep playing and see where it takes me.\" Greer, who won his 11th cap after starting in Saturday's 3-0 defeat by France in Metz, has no idea where he will be playing when Scotland start their World Cup qualifying campaign against Malta in September. \"Hopefully I'll get something and I'll be fit and ready for the qualifiers,\" said the centre-half who did not win his first cap until he turned 32. \"I am open to anything. I would like anything with a good opportunity where teams are pushing for something.\" Greer had spent six years at Brighton after leaving Swindon Town but found himself out of Chris Hughton's starting XI after January. Injuries led to a recall for their final game of the season against Middlesbrough, when a 1-1 draw denied Brighton automatic promotion, and he retained his place for the play-off semi-final defeat by Sheffield Wednesday. The lengthy inactivity meant he was thankful for more game time against France despite being on the receiving end of a heavy defeat. \"It was very tough,\" said the former Clyde, Blackburn Rovers, Kilmarnock and Doncaster Rovers centre-half. \"They are a very good team, got a lot of good players and we found it difficult at times. \"But it was good to go out there and get 90 minutes against some of the top players in the world, so it was interesting.\" Scotland had lost 1-0 to Italy six days earlier and failed to fire a shot on target in either of the two friendlies against sides preparing for the Euro 2016 finals in France. Greer was not one of those questioning the decision to play two very strong teams at the end of a long domestic season. \"Ultimately, as a footballer, you want to be playing out there against some of the best players in a great atmosphere because that's what you train for all season,\" he stressed. \"We've got some talented players coming through and I think it was really worthwhile for them as well. \"France are obviously at a different stage of their preparation going into the Euros and everybody's playing for places. \"We went out there and gave it everything, but we just fell short against a fantastic team.\"",
        "Sources say there has been a rise in avalanches, landslide-dammed rivers bursting, glaciers cracking and glacial lakes dangerously filling up. Studies by Chinese scientists have shown glaciers and permafrost rapidly melting in Tibet. Earthquakes also continue to destabilise them. A recent study has shown Tibet topping the list of places across the globe that has experienced an increase in water. Mining and dam construction in the Tibetan plateau have further fuelled concerns in downstream countries. In the absence of early warnings from Tibet, water-related disasters can cause human and property losses downstream in Bhutan, Nepal, India and potentially Bangladesh. One recent event took place in July when buildings in Nepalese towns bordering Tibet were swept away by a sudden flood. Authorities in Nepal say it was the result of landslides in Tibet that dammed the Bhotekoshi river. This is one of several rivers that run through Nepal which originate in Tibet. Most houses in Liping, the main town bordering Tibet, have either been swept away by floodwaters or brought down because of soil erosion caused by the floods. In Barabise and other smaller settlements, the BBC saw several houses precariously perched on the edge and all set to collapse because of the flooding. This was one of the most affected areas during last year's earthquake. \"That is where my house used to stand and now all you see is a cliff overlooking the river,\" said Nimji Sherpa, a shopkeeper. \"That night I received a call from my relative upstream that a flood was hurtling towards us. I dragged my old husband to higher land.\" \"The next morning we came back to see that our house and all that we had was gone. Last year the earthquake destroyed my house and we had come here to start afresh and now floods have taken everything,\" she said, with tears in her eyes. Further up, a stretch of the Arniko highway, that links Nepal to Tibet, is gone which has disrupted traffic. \"The authorities have told us to move 100 metres higher at night to sleep because we don't know what is coming our way,\" said Nimji Sherpa. \"How long can we live like this?\" Officials in Sindhupalchok district said they were able to evacuate people during the July flash flood. \"We were lucky that we could save people because of our own early warning system but timely information from the Tibet side could have helped us save properties as well,\" said Gokarna Dawadi, chief government official in the district, who recently left this role. \"We have approached the Chinese side a number of times to discuss this issue as we fear future disasters but it has not moved anywhere.\" In the past 80 years, scientists have recorded 10 occasions when glacial lakes burst out in Tibet and the flood waters reached Nepal. Officials in the Nepali capital Kathmandu said the Bhotekoshi disaster was an eye-opener. \"So far we have no communication between China and Nepal regarding the early flood warning system,\" said Rishi Raj Sharma, director general of Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology. \"There has been some initial dialogue with the Chinese meteorology department but we need to raise this more seriously through our foreign ministry.\" Residents of the Nepali towns bordering Tibet are having sleepless nights but settlements far away from the Tibetan territory are also at risk. The Bhotekoshi river is a tributary of the Kosi which flows down from Nepal into India to meet the Ganges. Locals in Sunsari district in south-eastern Nepal, where the Kosi is at its widest and most powerful, said they have heard about floods from Tibet and were concerned. The Kosi, known as the sorrow of Bihar flooded in 2008, displacing tens of thousands of people in Nepal and India. A local water expert Dev Narayan Yadav said fears of future floods were not unfounded. \"Our people here know how the bursting of glacial lakes in Tibet have flooded rivers in western Nepal and also in the Brahmaputra basin of India,\" Mr Yadav explained. \"And because the Kosi disaster of 2008 is quite fresh in their memory, they are really wary of what might be happening upstream.\" The Kosi barrage was built by India to control flood water and is operated by Indian authorities. It was built in 1962 and there are concerns it is no longer fit for purpose. The Indian government is planning to build a major dam upstream in Nepal. \"Big structures like these make us more scared because they will multiply the disaster and we will suffer,\" said Mr Yadav The Central Water Commission of India is tasked with planning and building the new dam. Officials say they have concerns about flooding from Tibet too but they're focused on the dams China is building on Tibetan rivers. \"If waters from them are released in a larger quantity, they may become floods and if we have no storage in the Indian portion, that may create havoc,\" the commission's chairman Ghanashyam Jha told the BBC. \"We have an arrangement for sharing flood information but all the desired information is not available.\" The water resource department of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh that shares a border with Tibet has stressed the proper networking of co-basins for flood warnings. \"The flash flood of Pasighat during 11 May 2000 is an example in which the loss of lives and properties could have been minimised had there been proper networking and sharing of information to the downstream county,\" it says on its website. The Chinese authorities in Beijing did not respond to our questions. Officials in Tibet, however, said flood information was being shared with India and Bangladesh. They said they would only do the same with Nepal if they received instructions from the Chinese ministry of water resources. The United Nations wants all parties to work together. \"I think there should be cross-boundary cooperation between countries in the region and unless it happens we cannot control floods,\" says Vijay Singh, a senior official the United Nations Development Programme Nepal office, who has worked on flood management in the country for years. \"We are creating a platform so that governments of Nepal and China can come together and realise the importance of information exchange between the two but it will take some time.\"",
        "In 2008, elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening in Norwich and senior city council officers moved in. The council's head of neighbourhood and strategic housing, Kristine Reeves, was later sacked over the affair. The development proposals, put forward by Norwich City Council, include 60 flats and 45 houses. The report to the council says 35 of the houses and flats will be for social rent. A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans. Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed. In February 2009, London-based architects Riches Hawley Mikhail won a competition to design a new social housing development on the site, but they were never commissioned. During that year homes on the derelict site were demolished, but the site has since remained untouched.",
        "Mohit Dupar, 36, attempted to reach Gustavo Silva Da Cruz, 19, after he got into difficulty at Camber Sands, East Sussex, on 24 July. Mr Silva Da Cruz died at the scene. Mr Dupar died in hospital four days later. East Sussex coroner Alan Craze said he would be looking at what public safety measures could be used at the beach. More news from Sussex The inquest in Hastings was told Mr Dupar, from Hayes, west London, died from a brain injury caused by cardiac arrest due to drowning. His 17-year-old son Ankush was also pulled from the sea, and remained in a coma for three weeks. Mr Silva Da Cruz, a Brazilian national who had been visiting family in Croydon, south London, died from drowning with his asthma possibly an exacerbating factor, the inquest heard. Robert Cass, of Rother District Council, said he believed the incoming tide meant the men became stranded and unable to get off a sandbar. Mr Craze adjourned the hearing and said he was considering verdicts of misadventure. A pre-inquest review into the deaths of five men from London was also held in Hastings. Kenugen Saththiyanathan, 18, known as Ken, and his brother Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, 22, known as Kobi, both of Normandy Way, Erith, south-east London, were among the friends who died in the sea at Camber Sands on 24 August. Nitharsan Ravi, 22, of Admaston Road, Plumstead, south-east London, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, of Chadwell Road, Grays, Essex, and Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, of Elsa Road, Welling, south-east London, were also in the group. A date for a full inquest was not formally fixed, and a decision on whether the inquest would be heard in front of a jury was deferred. The coroner said he would want to hear expert evidence into what public safety measures would be practical and recommendable, including the possibility of having sections of the beach for swimming only. \"The provision of safety for the vast numbers of people that go to Camber is now an extremely important matter, and I owe it to the community as a whole to investigate as far as I conceivably can do,\" Mr Craze said.",

        "Its ethical policy states that any artwork using Lego products should not \"contain any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements.\" However, the Danish company was widely attacked by commentators and accused of not wishing to annoy the Chinese government, which Ai regularly criticises. Lego has now relented and on Wednesday announced that it had changed its policy. It will no longer ask customers what they want to use the bricks for, but requests that they make clear that the company does not support or endorse their projects, if exhibited in public. But should a business be picky about whom it sells to? The problem is that selling as much as you can to anyone and everyone can have unintended consequences. Some customers can turn into your competitors. LVMH, which owns luxury brands from Christian Dior clothing to Dom Perignon champagne, has had its Chinese business undermined by bulk sales ferried into the country by so-called \"daigou\" agents. Taxes and currency differences make luxury goods far more expensive in China. Some analysts estimated that by mid-2015, Chinese prices were 60 higher than those in Europe. The daigou agents, many of them students making extra cash to finance their overseas studies, buy up luxury products in bulk in Europe and Hong Kong and sell them on at home. It is sometimes known as parallel trading. So LVMH started to watch its customers more closely. Speaking on a conference call earlier last year, Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer at LVMH, said: \"We've placed strict retail restrictions for the amount of products that people can buy. \"But, when you see someone in a store, you don't know whether they are buying handbags for themselves or to sell them on to the market in China. We are trying to make sure we are not competing with our own products in the China market, but our actions are not entirely bullet-proof.\" Other companies have found it easier to try to equalise prices. The fashion house Chanel raised its European prices by 20 and cut them in China, directly competing with the daigou agents and successfully eroding their profit margins. This kind of grey market happens everywhere. A supermarket might halve the price of a box of chocolates in a sale and sell them all to a single customer, only to see them turn up in the corner store down the road, undercutting their recommended retail price, a fortnight later. That's not illegal, but there are ways to stop it - by restricting sales. The British Retail Consortium's external affairs adviser, Bryan Johnston, says: \"In the end, it is up to the individual store. It is in the gift of the retailer to decide on how much they want to sell to any one customer.\" Many supermarkets imposed restrictions two years ago when the scandal over contaminated baby milk in China prompted overseas Chinese to buy up formula and import it into China. However, these were more to do with trying to stop a run on the product at home than trying to stop any kind of parallel trading abroad. But for some retailers more is, well, more. Marks and Spencer spokeswoman Clare Wilkes says: \"A few years ago, a woman came into one of our stores and bought up the every piece of cashmere we had. We had no objection to that - at all.\" But the luxury goods industry on the whole is very choosey about whom it sells to. The most famous example is Burberry, which by 2006, when Angela Ahrendts became chief executive, was growing just 2 a year in a booming luxury market. It was selling everything from kilts to dog cover-ups and leashes - to everyone. Ms Ahrendts wrote later in the Harvard Business Review: \"In luxury, ubiquity will kill you - it means you're not really luxury anymore. And we were becoming ubiquitous.\" Ms Ahrendts completely restructured the company, drastically reducing its product range, centralising production and design, making it more expensive and then, restricting the customer base. She added: \"We began to shift our marketing efforts from targeting everyone, everywhere, to focusing on the luxury customers of the future - millennials. We believed that these customers were being ignored by our competitors.\" The restrictions it imposed were financial. The kilt and dog-leash buyers were simply priced out of the market. Many of the core Burberry products, such as the signature trench coat, now cost more than 1,000 (PS700). Brand consultant Rebecca Battman says: \"There are unintended consequences of your brand becoming popular - the more widely seen it becomes, the more it will diminish the power of the brand among the people you really want to appeal to.\" Ms Ahrendts' strategy worked. Within five years, Burberry's revenues and operating income had doubled and 2014-15 revenues rose 11. Less had become more.",
        "Stephen Pearson and Martyn Woolford gave the hosts a deserved half-time lead after a dominant first half. Joe Mason's header gave Cardiff hope, but a slick counter attack saw Woolford restore the two-goal advantage. Cardiff again replied through Heidar Helguson only for debutant Sam Baldock to finally put the result beyond doubt with three minutes remaining. Bristol City's final two goals epitomised the difference between the two sides as they broke with pace and purpose to rip open Cardiff's defence. Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors, who offered virtually nothing in the first half of a match which kicked off before the day's other Championship fixtures, sorely missed Craig Bellamy's penetration as the starting front three of Helguson, debutant Tommy Smith and Don Cowie failed to make any impact. Mason's introduction and a change of formation at half-time transformed Cardiff, giving manager Malky Mackay food for thought as he considers how best to mould a new-look side. But there were plenty of positives for Robins manager Derek McInnes as his side scored four goals for a successive Championship match to secure only a second win over Cardiff in the last 10 league meetings. Bristol City's pressure gradually grew as the first half wore on, with the pacey Albert Adomah exploiting the space vacated by Cardiff's advancing full-backs. Adomah wasted the first clear chance when he shot wide and then Ryan Taylor's header found the side netting. But the opener was a complete gift as Aron Gunnarsson's misplaced pass deep in his own half exposed the Cardiff defence. Adomah penetrated before his cut-back found Pearson, who arced the ball into the bottom-left corner from the just inside the penalty area. The outstanding Jonathan Stead was the next architect as more sloppy Cardiff play led to the home side's second on the stroke of half-time. The rangy striker used his frame to protect the ball and the on-rushing Woolford passed the ball past Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall. Mackay responded to his side's lacklustre show by replacing Gunnarsson with Mason, and the change bore immediate dividends as the substitute found space in a crowded six-yard box to head home after Peter Whittingham's corner. The Bluebirds, back in their more familiar blue shirts, immediately found more purpose and energy, with Mason's direct running finally testing the home defenders. Whittingham, whose long-range efforts were all Cardiff managed in the first half, went close with another shot after Smith had broken through. But the Robins responded to the warning signs with a textbook counter attack to score their third. The Cardiff defence, which included debutant Matthew Connolly in Ben Turner's absence with injury, was ripped apart down the middle and Woolford had a simple task to score after Baldock's shot rebounded off the post. Helguson, scoring his first league goal since joining Cardiff from Queens Park Rangers, ensured a tense final minutes when he slotted through Tom Heaton's legs. But the home nerves were calmed five minutes later when Baldock, a 64th-minute substitute, ensured a scoring debut when he beat Marshall after being played through the heart of the static Cardiff defence. Bristol City manager Derek McInnes: \"We are getting goals from the middle of the park, which we didn't do last season and now have some great options up front. \"With Sam [Baldock] and Steve [Davies] on board, we have a lot of different strikers, who pose threats in various ways. All the clubs I have been at, who were successful, had good strength in depth when it came to strikers. \"It is very early days, but after last season I'm delighted to be challenging at the right end of the table even at this stage of the campaign.\" Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay: \"Without taking anything away from Bristol's performance, we conceded some bad goals. \"We gave the ball away in poor areas, which is not like us. We started the season defensively strong, but today we didn't keep to that standard. \"If you gift possession to good teams they are going to punish you. We will look at the DVD and identify where we could have done a lot better.\" Live text commentary",

Watch TomSka talking about how hard it is now to make your mark in the world of YouTube To begin with he says he was worried that it would be another \"puff piece\" talking about how \"kids make money in their bedrooms, like every news report\" on them. And, given how much of their lives are already public, it could seem like an odd choice of subject for a documentary maker. \"Even though they are sharing their lives, they're not necessarily sharing all the different aspects of what it's like to be a vlogger,\" says Nanette Burstein, the Oscar-nominated director behind the film. \"This was an opportunity to get them to open up.\" Along with TomSka, The Creators also features Zoella and twins NikiNSammy. \"They put in me ranting about things and it wasn't just'everything is lovely',\" TomSka says. \"I mean you do get a lot of everything is lovely because you see Zoella, who is just lovely.... but then you get me being all pessimistic.\" He says, unlike other vloggers, he finds it harder to make money through brand endorsements. \"As YouTube has grown, managers and people have learned to apply the Disney kid method,\" he says. \"They become these deities, these beings of perfection in the eyes of their audience. And that is worth a lot more money. \"I would rather put an honest version of myself forward. And it makes me no money. No-one wants to buy a shirt with me on it.\" He did get in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority last year, over a promotion with a biscuit brand, that was said not to be clearly labelled as an advert. \"I've always tried to be very open and very honest with my audience. I've been caught out by that recently. Apparently I wasn't honest enough,\" he says. He has been open about his problems with mental illness as well, sharing videos with his fans about his depression. \"I really don't know what long-term effects my relationship with my audience and with YouTube is going to have on me,\" he says. \"I like sharing and I like being very honest and I have found that it feels good but then again maybe it's not. \"I've forgotten what the difference is between Thomas Ridgewell and TomSka.\" \"You put me in a room with 1,000 fans and I can take photos and sign and be lovely to every single person. \"But you put me in a room with 10 people who know the real me and I'm not going to know what to do any more.\" The Creators is available to view on YouTube now.

        "The list, compiled by a panel of 144 DJs, critics and writers, highlights 15 rising acts for the coming year. It includes Canadian RB sensation Alessia Cara, singer-songwriter Frances and witty rap collective Section Boyz. Last year's victors were pop trio Years and Years, with previous winners including Adele, Sam Smith and Haim. After topping the list, Years and Years' debut album, Communion, entered the charts at number one and the band recently announced their first headline show at Wembley Arena. 2015's runner-up, singer-songwriter James Bay, also scored the year's biggest-selling debut album, Chaos and the Calm. \"The fact that people think I can have the same potential as these huge artists is incredible,\" said Cara, whose debut single, Here, has just entered the US top 10. Find out more and watch videos on the Sound Of 2016 site What happened to the previous winners? As with previous years, young solo artists feature prominently on the 2016 list, including soul diva Izzy Bizu and British-Kosovan pop singer Dua Lipa, who was talent-spotted by Lana Del Rey's managers. But the front-runner is bound to be Jack Garratt - a soulful multi-instrumentalist who has been compared to Ed Sheeran and James Blake. The 24-year-old, from Buckinghamshire, has already won the Brits Critics' Choice award, and will receive the Introducing prize at next month's BBC Music Awards. Guitars are notably absent from the longlist, with Stockport psych-rock quintet Blossoms and indie upstart Ratboy the only traditional rock acts to make the cut. \"We are delighted to be a part of the BBC's Sound Of 2016,\" said Blossoms. \"To discover we're one of the only guitar acts on the list this year is exciting for all of us. Viva Stockport!\" As with last year, rap and grime make a strong showing, with Londoners J Hus, Loyle Carner, WSTRN and Section Boyz all featured. Most of them reached the longlist without traditional music industry support. J Hus has racked up six million streams of his Afrobeat-inspired party track Lean and Bop without a record deal; while Section Boyz saw their independently-released mixtape, Don't Panic, enter the top 40 earlier this year. \"I am so excited to hear that I am in the longlist,\" said J Hus. \"It's a massive honour to be recognised and makes me want to continue for the fans.\" As the daughter of pop legend Neneh Cherry and Massive Attack producer Cameron McVey, Stockholm-born Mabel was raised around music - but held back from her own career until recently. \"It's so unoriginal of me. Why didn't I just go and be an astronaut?\" she joked in an interview with The Beat Juice. Similarly, London-born NAO was reluctant to share her music, despite a degree in jazz from the Guildhall School of Music Drama. She worked as a backing singer for the likes of Jarvis Cocker and Pulp before gathering the courage to upload some of her music to SoundCloud. Shortly afterwards, she found her first single, So Good, being championed by Zane Lowe. The list is rounded off by electronic producer Muru Masa and 16-year-old folk singer Billie Marten. The Sound Of.... list launched in 2003, and has a track record in championing new and innovative acts, many of whom have gone on to achieve global success. According to the rules, the acts should not already be well known to the UK general public - through featuring in the final stages of a TV talent show, for example, or having already been a member of a successful band. They must also not have been the lead artist on a UK top 20 single or album before 30 October 2015 - though guest vocalists are eligible. The 15-act longlist will be whittled down to five in January, with the winner announced on the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show on 8 January 2016. DJ Annie Mac said the Sound Of 2016 was \"a definitive list of the key artists to look out for and listen to\" next year. \"It has real results, incredible success stories and I'm looking forward to being able to support these people on my radio shows.\"",
        "The body, believed to be that of Victoria Cherry, 44, of Fulwood, Lancashire, was found by Greater Manchester Police at a house in Toronto Street, Bolton, on Monday. It was discovered following the earlier arrest of a 43-year-old man on suspicion of murder. Ms Cherry has not been seen since October 2015. Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton said: \"We are continuing to support Victoria's family as they deal with this devastating news. \"The arrested man remains in custody, but I'm urging anyone with any information that would help our enquiries to get in touch. \"If you have information about Victoria's whereabouts since her disappearance in 2015, or if you hold any information about the events leading up to our discovery, please contact us as a matter of urgency.\"",
        "Rees says they felt there was \"no drama\" trailing 14-7 at half-time. But defeat left Ospreys - and Welsh regional rugby - without a top-tier knockout place since 2010. And as they trail in the Pro12, captain Alun Wyn Jones admitted Ospreys face a tough task to make the 2016-17 tournament. They are currently seventh in the Pro12 table, four points behind Ulster, who occupy the sixth and final Champions Cup qualification place. Wales lock Jones said: \"We have to focus now on a tough Six Nations period because we are currently not in a position to play in this competition this year.\" Hanno Dirksen crossed in the opening period against Exeter and Ospreys were awarded a penalty try that gave them late hope. But two tries apiece for Thomas Waldrom and James Short in addition to Kai Horstmann's opener saw off the visitors. Rees said Ospreys felt \"pure disappointment\" at failing to to take their opportunity to progress against the second-placed team in the Aviva Premiership. \"We spoke at half-time that there was no drama, we could build our way into the game and create some pressure without overdoing it against Exeter,\" said Rees. \"And I think we did that at the start of the second half, even at the end when we were 26-17 down. If we can negate their work in the 22 you'll get another shot and that potentially takes you through. \"We knew all that. Al [Jones] was getting messages - he was pretty clear, but it's redundant anyway.\" Jones said: \"It wasn't the ideal start. Two quick tries put us on the back foot, but in the same breath it was probably the best time to have them because we've got another 70 minutes to go. \"Unfortunately we probably chased a bit too much. \"We brought ourselves back into contention, but the game got away from us and and we had too much to do.\" Ospreys went into the final round top of Pool Two after earning two bonus points in defeats at Clermont Auvergne and Bordeaux-Begles and beating both French Top 14 teams and Exeter at their Liberty Stadium home. Jones said: \"There's a lot of emotion involved in those performances we've had. We've probably lived off emotion and performed off emotion, but you can't really afford to do that in this competition. \"I remember being away in London Irish in the same competition. We went out there with a team that was probably on paper far superior and had the same result, so I think Gruff has nailed it on the head with the word'devastated'. \"I said to the guys at the end that none of you in here [the media] said we would be in contention to get out of the pool and it's true. I remember doing the interview at the start of the season and somebody laughed, which is fine. \"And it's not about defying the odds or proving other people wrong, it's about working for each other and trying to do something different. \"We've made a point about all the big names that have gone through this jersey and not got ourselves in the position that we have. \"Ultimately we've faltered again and we haven't done that [gone through], but I can say credit to the team and we're proud to have come so close.\"",
        "Martin Foran, 71 and from Manchester, served a total of 18 years in prison but was twice cleared on appeal. The Ministry of Justice said it only pays compensation when a conviction is quashed \"because of a new fact.\" But, Mr Foran says despite being found innocent his ordeal has left him ill and unable to pay basic bills. Mr Foran was convicted in 1978 of robbery following an investigation by the since discredited West Midlands Serious Crime Squad. He was portrayed as an IRA member by a regional paper and served six years of a 10-year sentence. The conviction was finally quashed last year. Between his release and his successful appeal, he was found guilty in 1985 of robbing a Birmingham pub landlord. That conviction was quashed on appeal in 2013, but not before he had served 12 years inside, during which time he spent 47 days in a rooftop protest and hunger strike at Nottingham jail. His wife Valerie even scaled a nearby roof in a show of solidarity. Last year, Mr Foran held a three-week protest outside the Ministry of Justice in London as part of his compensation fight. He said he was told the justice secretary would speak to the West Midlands chief constable, but has not heard any update about this since. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, he said the London protest \"nearly killed me.\" \"It is affecting my health but I will continue fighting to my grave. My health is worsening.\" He added: \"I've had to walk the streets trying to find a solicitor who would represent me on a no-win no-fee basis. It has been soul-destroying. \"I can't even afford to run the car and the phone is about to be cut off. I'm also behind with the gas and electricity bill.\" Mr Foran said his dying wish is to get an apology for his family. \"It destroys me that no-one has apologised to my wife Valerie and children for what has happened as they have suffered more than I have,\" he added. \"I would like to be able to go on holiday with my wife and enjoy what time we have left, but I cannot do this.\" Speaking about Mr Foran's case, a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \"The fact that a conviction has been quashed by the Court of Appeal does not mean it was necessarily a miscarriage of justice.\" The BBC has yet to receive a response from West Midlands Police.",
        "The 27-year-old Israeli international joins from Ashdod for an undisclosed fee, after spending last season on loan at Easter Road. \"It was not so easy, but I'm happy to get it done finally,\" Marciano told Hibs TV. \"My first season was hard and I didn't really know what Hibs means, but it was an amazing experience.\" Marciano made 28 appearances for Hibs last season as the Edinburgh club secured their return to the top-flight by winning the Championship. He is the club's fourth signing of the summer - after Efe Ambrose, Danny Swanson and Simon Murray - and will compete with Ross Laidlaw for the starting goalkeeper slot in the Premiership this season. \"I wanted to become a better player when I came here and I think I did that,\" Marciano said. \"That's why I wanted to come back to Hibs - because I have everything here to be a better player. \"And of course the fans are amazing and it's a privilege to play in front of them every week.\"",
        "Roy Oliver, 37, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs in April, killing Jordan Edwards, 15. His lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial. The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations. The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party. Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party. Police had initially said the vehicle reversed \"aggressively\" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him. He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car. \"It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA's office,\" Faith Johnson, the county's district attorney, said in a statement. The teenager was described by his coach as \"a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend.\" Roy Oliver faces five to 99 years in prison on the murder charge, the Dallas Observer reports. If convicted, he would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas county since 1973, the report adds. He is currently free on bail. Lee Merritt, a lawyer for the Edwards family, said on Twitter: \"We remain cautious. A murder indictment for Roy Oliver is appropriate but the fact is it's been [more than] 40 years since a cop was convicted in [Texas].\"",
        "The 35-year-old will have security clearance and access to classified information, but no official title or salary when she works in the West Wing. She will serve as her father's \"eyes and ears\" while providing broad-ranging advice, her attorney told Politico. Ms Trump, who owns a fashion brand, will join husband Jared Kushner, who is a senior adviser to the president. The US first daughter said in a statement: \"While there is no modern precedent for an adult child of the president, I will voluntarily follow all of the ethics rules placed on government employees. \"I will continue to offer my father my candid advice and counsel, as I have for my entire life.\" After Mr Kushner's White House appointment was announced, Ms Trump said she would focus on settling her family in Washington rather than work for the administration. Her step-mother, First Lady Melania Trump, has so far chosen to stay in New York with Mr Trump's youngest son. Ms Trump's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told AP news agency: \"Our view is that the conservative approach is for Ivanka to voluntarily comply with the rules that would apply if she were a government employee, even though she is not.\" But some have criticised the decision to give her a White House position, even though she will have no actual job title. Andrew Herman, an attorney who has advised lawmakers on ethics issues, said: \"I think the right way to do that is to make her a special government employee. \"But that implicates all kind of formal and disclosure issues.\" The political influence of the US first daughter and her husband has raised questions about possible conflicts of interests. Federal anti-nepotism laws bar relatives of the president from being appointed to government positions. But an exception was made for Mr Kushner after the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel cited the president's \"special hiring authority.\" Since the election Ms Trump has placed her fashion company's interests in a trust, handing off day-to-day operations to her top executive. Her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Josh Kushner and Nicole Meyer, have been named trustees, reports the New York Times. However, several retailers have dropped her products, saying that sales of her brand were falling. Ms Trump is also being sued by a fashion company in San Francisco that says she is cashing in on her position as first daughter. Modern Appealing Clothing said in court documents filed last week that Ms Trump's firm has an \"unfair advantage\" in the marketplace. She has already forbidden her eponymous brand from advertising using images of her taken since the inauguration. Since Mr Trump's inauguration in January, Ms Trump has been seen attending meetings with world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, last week, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ms Trump is due to release a book - Women Who Work - in May, with the proceeds going to charity, Ms Gorelick said.",
        "It follows a successful bid to part-fund construction of the Manchester Cancer Research Centre (MCRC) on the Christie Hospital site in Withington. The PS35m facility will work on developing personalised cancer treatments for thousands of patients across the UK. A university spokesman said the announcement was a \"fantastic boost.\" Chris Cox, the university's director of development, said the research centre would translate discoveries made in the laboratory into new treatments. He said it would house 150 additional researchers who will be developing new ideas and treatments. Research will focus on radiation therapy, lung cancer, women's cancers, melanoma and haematological oncology. The centre is the result of a partnership between The University of Manchester, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust and Cancer Research UK. The Christie's chief executive Caroline Shaw said the funding would \"help facilitate groundbreaking research right here in Manchester.\" \"The MCRC is a major step forward that will maximise our potential to benefit not just cancer patients on our doorstep but across the world.\" The Christie treats more than 40,000 patients a year, with about a quarter of patients referred from other parts of the country for specialist treatment. The announcement was made by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to \"progress cancer research development in Manchester.\" David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science said the centre \"will address the key issues we face\" in tackling cancer. Revised plans for the research centre were given the go-ahead in March after a proposal for a multi-storey car park on the site was dropped. The centre is scheduled to open in 2014.",
        "It is the first time the high-security facility has invited watchdog Healthwatch to speak to its residents.

West London Mental Health NHS Trust, which runs the unit, said it was a \"groundbreaking initiative.\" The announcement came after the hospital, based in Crowthorne and home to some of the UK's most notorious killers, was issued with a Care Quality Commission warning notice in December. Carolyn Regan, chief executive of the trust, said receiving patient feedback was \"crucial to ensuring we are providing a responsive and high-quality service.\" She said: \"Having an external independent organisation such as Healthwatch listen to patient feedback is even more valuable.\" Mark Sanders, of Healthwatch Bracknell Forest, said: \"Patients within a high secure forensic hospital should have as much say about the services they receive as any other patient. \"We are happy to be able to support that voice for patients and feedback to West London Mental Health NHS Trust to improve the services and environment offered.\"",

        "Around 200 people are feared to have drowned as they tried to cross from Zuwara, west of Tripoli, to Italy. Police in Italy have detained 10 suspected traffickers after 52 people were found dead in the hold of a ship off the coast of Libya on Wednesday. President Obama's spokesman said the migrant crisis showed that unrest in the Middle East had a worldwide impact. Josh Earnest said Europe should get tougher on traffickers who were exploiting migrants. On Friday workers from the Libyan Red Crescent were undertaking the grim task of recovering migrants' bodies which had washed up on the coast. \"We, the Red Crescent, work with nothing. Some fishermen help us with a boat,\" Ibrahim al-Attoushi from the Red Crescent in Zuwara told Reuters. \"We only have one ambulance car.\" Around 100 bodies have already been found, and the United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR) said a further 100 people are unaccounted for. Some of those who died were trapped in the hull of one of the boats. The Libyan coast-guard had worked overnight on Thursday, searching for survivors from the two boats. At least 150 survivors of the sinkings have been taken to a refugee centre and a detention centre in Libya. Ayman Talaal, a Syrian survivor, said he and his family had been \"forced into this route.\" \"It's called the route of death. It is now called the grave of the Mediterranean sea,\" he said. While most of the victims of Thursday's capsizes are thought to be from Syria and African countries, a Bangladeshi diplomat told the BBC that at least five Bangladeshi nationals, including a six-month-old baby, were among the dead. Some survivors were rescued having spent the night in the water, clinging to life jackets. Meanwhile officials in Palermo investigating the deaths of 52 migrants found dead in a boat's hold on Wednesday have detained 10 of the 571 survivors brought ashore, on suspicion of murder, Rai TV reports. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia told AP that those detained included seven Moroccans, two Syrians and a Libyan. A Swedish coastguard ship, the Poseidon, working with the EU's Frontex border agency, brought the survivors and the bodies to the Sicilian port. Thousands of people set off from lawless Libya every night, packed into boats, trying to reach safety in Europe. Many of the vessels are not seaworthy and are overcrowded. Since the overthrow of Col Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has descended into chaos, with various militias fighting for power. The internationally-recognised government has been forced to leave Tripoli and does not control the country's western coast, from where most migrant boats depart, aiming for Italy. The UNHCR says more than 2,500 people have died trying to reach Europe so far in 2015, not including Thursday's deaths. Meanwhile Austrian police have confirmed that 71 people died inside a refrigerated lorry found abandoned on a motorway near the Hungarian border. They think that at least some of the dead were from Syria. \"If we had an orderly safe way for people to come to Europe then we would avoid these tragedies,\" the UNHCR's William Spindler told the BBC. \"We would also have less incentives for illegal immigration because we would have legal avenues to come, so people would not have to risk their lives in this way.\"",
        "The adult female's remains - including a head and hands found in a bag - were discovered in eight locations, Irish police have confirmed. They are investigating whether the death is linked to a personal dispute. More than 200 gardai (police), Irish soldiers and civil defence personnel are continuing to search the area. The man arrested remains in police custody in Bray, 20km (12 miles) south of Dublin, where he can be questioned for up to 24 hours. He presented himself to Gardai in County Wexford on Tuesday night and was subsequently arrested, Irish broadcaster RTE reported. The focus of the murder investigation changed following a series of developments on Tuesday evening. The results of DNA tests from the partial torso discovered by two walkers in the undergrowth, close to Military Road, on Saturday night showed the body was that of a woman. More human remains, including a head and hands, were discovered over a 30km-area on Tuesday. Police said they had now recovered most of the remains, and that there is only one victim. Supt Pat Ward, described the unprecedented case as \"troubling.\" \"We are conscious of the fact that the body found is that of a loved one,\" he said. \"What we have found are limbs, we've also found some significant parts of the torso and we've also found in one of the locations, in a bag, the head and the hands of the deceased,\" he added.",
        "England seamer James Anderson, who took 3-5 on the third evening, finished with figures of 4-20 as the Red Rose skittled Hampshire for 168 on day four. The visitors had resumed on 50-5, still trailing by 148, and were unable to make Lancashire bat again. Dane Vilas' 244 had put the home team in control earlier in the match. Alex Davies and Ryan McLaren also chipped in with centuries to give Lancashire a big first-innings lead, but it was their impressive bowling display in Hampshire's second innings that ensured victory. Anderson's 15 overs cost only 20 runs as he tore through the visitors' top order, while McLaren (3-41) and Kyle Jarvis (3-49) did the rest of the damage. England's all-time leading wicket-taker Anderson was playing in his first match after a month out through injury, with his country's first Test of the summer against South Africa starting on 6 July. Gareth Berg, the last Hampshire wicket to fall, top-scored with 49, while James Vince's 29 was the next best individual effort. Lancashire have gone above Hampshire and Yorkshire up to second in Division One, 14 points behind leaders Essex, who beat Warwickshire - also by an innings. England fast bowler James Anderson told BBC Radio Lancashire: \"Not many people would have expected Essex and Lancashire to be first and second after seven games but we're in a really strong position and we have a lot of competition for places. \"We're not going to get carried away. We now have a big game against Warwickshire and, if we get a result there, it will put us in a great position before the back end of the summer. \"We're better placed to sustain this position but we have to make sure that what happened last year doesn't happen again. This week was a really good performance but there are still areas on which we can improve. \"Al Davies, Dane Vilas and Ryan McLaren got us up to a really good score. Dane and Ryan are really solid professionals who have been fantastic additions. And we thought if we could put the ball in the right areas we could really challenge them and take 10 wickets.\" Hampshire coach Craig White told BBC Radio Solent: \"It was going to be a big ask. But to fold again on a pretty good pitch is extremely disappointing. \"Bergy tried and there was a bit of fight there at the end, but it was too much to ask really. \"Anderson bowled beautifully, but the ball's allowed to swing and we should be able to combat that. \"It seems that if the ball does swing or seam we get in a bit of trouble. We need to work on that, improve on that, try and stay positive, and get back on the horse, so to speak.\"",

A spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said: \"The engagement will allow the princes to pay tribute to the life and work of their mother.\" They met representatives from the causes and charities supported by Diana, including the Royal Marsden and Great Ormond Street hospitals, the National Aids Trust, Centrepoint youth homelessness charity and the Leprosy Mission. Members of the public have been leaving tributes and flowers at the gates of the palace to mark the anniversary of Diana's death. The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in Paris, when William, now the Duke of Cambridge, was 15 and his brother was 12. The garden at their mother's former home has been inspired by memories of her life, style and image, such as her white \"Elvis\" Catherine Walker dress. The White Garden, as it is known, follows a tradition first established at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, famous for its own white garden created in the 1930s. Their Royal Highnesses met gardener Sean Harkin who designed the display and Graham Dillamore who knew the princess when he worked there some 30 years ago. The garden has been open since spring and will continue into September with white roses, lilies, gladioli and cosmos. It is the fourth London memorial created in tribute to Diana - the others are the Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace, the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, and the Diana Memorial Walk at St James's Palace.",

        "The security forces are reported to have used tear gas against stone-throwing protesters. They also surrounded the hometown of Burhan Wani, 22, who was killed fighting Indian troops last year. Separately seven people are reported to have been killed in shelling across the Line of Control that divides Indian and Pakistani-administered Kashmir. Officials on the Pakistani side told Reuters that five people died in Indian shelling, while Indian officials say two people were killed by Pakistani fire. There has been an armed revolt in the Muslim-majority region against rule by India since 1989, although violence has waned in recent years. The disputed region is claimed by both India and Pakistan in its entirety. India blames Pakistan for fuelling the unrest, a claim denied by Islamabad. Burhan Wani is credited with reviving the image of militancy in Muslim-majority Indian-administered Kashmir, becoming a figurehead for young people. Saturday's violence started as people tried to walk to his home in Tral - where he died in a shootout with the army last July. His death led to a wave of protests during which dozens of people were killed. The Indian authorities imposed heavy restrictions in the Kashmir valley for the anniversary, stopping internet access and sealing off Tral. There have also been reports of army personnel being injured in a militant attack overnight on Friday.",
        "Cole Doyle and his family had planned a trip to Costa Rica but the first leg of the journey was overbooked. The family travelled to two other airports and spent an extra C1,000 (PS590) to get a flight. The airline has now offered them compensation. It comes after video of a man being dragged from a US flight brought overbooking to public attention. Dr David Dao has said he will sue United Airlines after he lost two front teeth and his nose was broken when the airline called security officers in to help remove him from the plane. He had refused to leave when the airline asked for volunteers to make way for staff members. In response to the huge backlash the company faced on social media, United said it would allocate seats for staff at least an hour in advance, in future. It also promised it would no longer ask law enforcement officers to remove passengers. Separately in the UK, two passengers were asked to leave an Easyjet flight they had already boarded, and told the next flight to their destination was in four days. They decided not to reschedule, as they had booked non-refundable accommodation. After the United incident, the Canadian government announced it would overhaul the rules to \"ensure that passengers' rights are protected.\" But well before that, Cole Doyle and his brother and parents were inconvenienced by an overbooking problem. In March, the Doyle family tried to check in online to their flight to Montreal but could not assign a seat to Cole. When they got to the airport at Charlottetown on Prince Edward Island, they were told there was no seat for him as the flight had been overbooked. His mother, Shanna, asked whether an adult could give up their seat for Cole but was told that even if someone did so, it would be likely to go to another passenger and could not be guaranteed for the boy. The family drove the two hours to Moncton in neighbouring New Brunswick, in the hope of getting on another flight. \"I'm crying in the back seat,\" Cole told the Canadian broadcaster CBC afterwards.\"Like how do I get to where I'm going? I don't know if I'm even going to make it with my family.\" Once they got there, though, they found out the flight they wanted had been cancelled. \"I thought it was a joke,\" said Cole's father, Brett. \"People are fed up. You shouldn't be able to sell something twice.\" The family eventually made it to Montreal and caught a connecting flight to Costa Rica for their holiday, but have since complained to Air Canada and received an offer of a C2,500 (PS1,500) voucher, along with an apology. An airline spokeswoman told the Canadian Press news agency: \"We are currently following up to understand what went wrong and have apologised to Mr Doyle and his family as well as offered a very generous compensation to the family for their inconvenience.\"",
        "Stormont officials have refused to give any details citing confidentiality. Homeowners will not face bills until at least March 2017, after MLAs ruled to defer charges. Instead, the executive pays the cost of PS280m a year to NI Water. Further legislation is expected to extend the policy. However, the decision could mean that the authorities are not complying with European rules on water quality. The EU Water Framework Directive envisages that users should pay for their water to promote conservation. Officials in Northern Ireland make the case that people do that through their regional rate. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK not to levy a charge on homes, although businesses do pay charges. That has prompted a debate with calls for the introduction of a charge on homes to pay for improvements in infrastructure. Now, the European Commission has opened a so-called \"pilot case\" to look at the issue. Essentially, this is a way for the commission to establish whether EU rules are being correctly applied. It allows for the commission and member states to resolve any conflicts without resorting to infringement proceedings. The Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said it could not comment on the detail of the case. \"It is the subject of a confidential dialogue with the Commission and the release of further details could potentially prejudice the outcome of those discussions,\" said the department. The two sides get about 20 weeks to try and sort out their differences. Many cases are resolved without going to a formal hearing.",
        "Leading F1 commercial figure Zak Brown has been contacted by McLaren as the company seeks a replacement. Dennis has been told by the two parties that own 75 of McLaren Group that his contract will not be renewed for 2017. But Brown, a 44-year-old American, is also considered a potential chief commercial officer for F1's new owners. The US media group Liberty is in the process of buying a controlling interest in the sport's commercial arm from investment group CVC Capital Partners. The deal is expected to be completed early next year. Brown is of particular interest to McLaren because of his success in finding new sponsors for a number of teams on the grid in his former role as boss of the marketing agency JMI, from which he resigned in September. McLaren have not had a title sponsor since parting company with mobile phone company Vodafone at the end of 2013. Ironically, McLaren have had a major success in recent weeks in securing a new partnership deal for BPCastrol to become their fuel and lubricant supplier. The deal has been signed but has not yet been announced. The company will replace Exxon Mobil, which has been poached by Red Bull for next season after 21 years with McLaren. That deal is expected to be announced imminently. The three names revealed by BBC Sport over the US Grand Prix weekend - ex-F1 team bosses Ross Brawn, Martin Whitmarsh and former Sainsbury's boss Justin King - remain of interest to McLaren and have been contacted by the team. But all three are now considered unlikely to take on the position. They may be unwilling to put themselves forward or it may be decided they are not the best person for the role. It is also possible Dennis, who is chairman and chief executive officer and has been in charge at McLaren for 35 years, would be replaced by two different people, as would be a more conventional company structure. Brown is friendly with all the main shareholders at McLaren, including Dennis. But BBC Sport understands that the Bahrainis and Ojjeh are now reaching out to him as they seek a new man to run the company. If McLaren can persuade him to take the role, it would be something of a coup for the team, since it has long been known that Brown has been favourite for the commercial head of F1 job at Liberty Media. Despite the ultimatum by his fellow shareholders, Dennis has been telling friends and confidants that he will decide when or if he will step down, not anyone else. But it is far from clear that he is in a position to make that decision. If his contract is not renewed, he would remain a 25 shareholder but would probably have no active role or power in running the company. Dennis will fight hard to retain his position as the head of McLaren, despite the fracturing of relationships between him on the one hand and Ojjeh and the Bahrainis on the other. He has run the company since 1981 and has become synonymous with McLaren, which he has built up into one of the sport's most successful teams, as well as launching a road-car company that sells high-end supercars. Dennis had been trying to find investment to enable him to buy a controlling shareholding in McLaren Group. He did have an agreement with Ojjeh and Mumtalakat that he could buy sufficient shares to take him over over 50 were he to find that investment. Dennis found two separate Chinese groups of investors. One was on the verge of completing a deal with Dennis before a weakening of the Chinese economy caused the arrangement to collapse. He then sourced a second group of Chinese investors and took them to Ojjeh and Mumtalkat, who refused to sell their shares because they did not want to grant Dennis so much power in the company.",
        "At least 290 people were killed and hundreds more injured when the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours of Wednesday, 100km (65 miles) north-east of Rome. The town of Amatrice was among the worst affected areas. The service at St Andrew's Cathedral was led by the Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia. It follows a similar event in Edinburgh on Sunday. Ronnie Convery, director of communications for the Archdiocese of Glasgow, said there had been wide interest in the service from Scotland's Italian community. \"We are looking at something like 400 new arrivals from Italy every month at the moment in Glasgow and Edinburgh,\" he said. \"It's those people I notice on social media who have really taken up the information about the mass today. \"It's also interesting that in many cases people are not necessarily practicing Catholics but they just want to have that opportunity to be together, to meet, to do something.\"",

        "The unemployment rate was 4.9, down from 5.5 a year earlier but little changed from last month's report, the Office for National Statistics said. Growth in average weekly earnings including bonuses slowed slightly to an increase of 2.3 on last year. The proportion of people in work hit a record high of 74.5. The ONS said the figures, which only cover one month since the result of the EU referendum, show \"continuing improvement\" in the jobs market. But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned: \"When you scratch beneath the surface, today's labour market figures are not as robust as they first appear.\" The rise in people in work \"remains supported by surging self-employment,\" Mr Tombs said. \"The strong growth also reflected a shift towards part-time working; total weekly hours rose by just 0.3 between April and July,\" he added. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the labour market is \"still waiting for the Brexit effect,\" but that it will \"gradually become clear over the next few months.\" In August the claimant count, including Jobseeker's Allowance, actually went up from the previous month by 2,400 to 771,000. The claimant count is treated with some caution, though, by economists as the move to Universal Credit has made it much harder to calculate. One interesting nugget in the employment figures concerns the number of people employed in the public sector. It is down to 5.33 million, the lowest level since the Office for National Statistics started collecting the figures in 1999 and a drop of 13,000 since March. The former chancellor, George Osborne, often spoke about the need to \"rebalance\" the economy. To an extent, he meant away from financial services and towards manufacturing. But, more privately, he was actually very comfortable with an economy that was \"rebalancing\" away from the public sector towards the private sector, where wealth, he would argue, is actually created. As cuts and wage freezes bite, the public sector has become less attractive as a place to build a career. Yes, employment is at record levels, but it is the private sector that is on the up. The unemployment estimates come from the Labour Force Survey in which the ONS talks to 40,000 households every three months. Although it is a very large survey, there is still a margin of error. The ONS says it is 95 confident that the figure of a 39,000 fall in unemployment is correct to within 78,000. As the estimated change is smaller than the margin of error, it means the change in unemployment is not statistically significant.",
        "The visitors led when Simon Makienok finished calmly for his second league goal this season from Greg Cunningham's pass just before the interval. Forest improved after the break and they levelled when Thomas Lam's volley went in via the post and Preston goalkeeper Chris Maxwell. Makienok and Alan Browne forced fine saves from Forest's Vladimir Stojkovic as the match finished level. Forest, who had been hammered 3-0 at rivals Derby on Sunday, started slowly and could have fallen behind in the opening minutes when Stojkovic saved brilliantly from Callum Robinson before later diverting Browne's strike from range onto the post. Nicklas Bendtner should have put the hosts in front when he fired over from Eric Lichaj's cross before Makienok scored just his second league goal of the season. Philippe Montanier changed formation at the break and Forest got the goal their improvement deserved when Lam's shot hit the post before bouncing off Maxwell's heel and into the net. Both teams had chances to win it, with Preston defender Alex Baptiste producing a brilliant goal-line clearance to deny Apostolos Vellios in the dying minutes. Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham: \"We deserved to lose the first half. The first half was awful, but we had a good reaction and a good game in the second half. \"The players showed good determination at the beginning of the second half and after that we were confident.\" Preston manager Simon Grayson told BBC Radio Lancashire: \"If you'd offered us a point before the start of the game, we'd have taken it because you expect Forest to have a reaction from the weekend's result. \"But we knew that if we got after them early on we could put them on the back foot and we did that. \"Overall I thought we had a very, very good first half. You just want to have that extra goal to go in 2-0 possibly at half-time based on how well we'd played. \"Second half, you knew there was going to be a reaction and they changed their system and had a go at us so it's a bit frustrating that we've not won the game, but the way the second half went at times I'm delighted we got another point.\" Match ends, Nottingham Forest 1, Preston North End 1.

        "Judge Thomas Lipps rejected arguments by defence lawyers that witnesses could face intimidation or harassment outside the courthouse in Steubenville. The case has attracted attention due to social media and the high profile of the football team in the small town. Judge Lipps also ruled the non-jury trial would be open to the public. He did so over the objections of the family of the 16-year-old girl who was allegedly attacked. She wanted to protect her identity and keep evidence that might eventually be ruled inadmissible from becoming public. Trenton Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, both 16, deny the charges they face next month at a juvenile court. Three other students who witnessed the alleged attack but were not charged are expected to testify at next month's trial. Those witnesses include two who took a video and photograph, then deleted the images. The Ohio attorney general's office told lawyers for those students last autumn that if the images had been found, they would have been charged. Prosecutors say the girl, who went to a school across the river from the city in West Virginia, was attacked after an alcohol-fuelled party last August. The case was thrust into the national spotlight after attention by bloggers and the hacker activist group Anonymous. Some claimed that the community had sought to cover up the alleged crime in order protect the two accused. The trial is set for 13 March.",
        "Scientists and charities say the human papilloma virus (HPV) jab will protect them from head and neck cancers. HPV is sexually transmitted and girls aged 12 and 13 receive the vaccine to protect them against cervical cancer. The Welsh government said it is waiting for advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Charities including Tenovus Cancer Care and organisations such as BMA Cymru and Cardiff University's HPV research team will deliver a letter to the Welsh government on Monday calling for the vaccination to be rolled out. They told BBC Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme the number of head and neck cancer cases are increasing. Dr Mererid Evans, consultant oncologist at Velindre Hospital in Cardiff, said: \"I've seen a difference in demographics over the last ten years. \"These are younger people with families, and three-quarters of those affected are men. The average age is 55 and most are non-smokers.\" Jon Antoniazzi, from Tenovus Cancer Care, added: \"HPV causes 5 of the global cancer burden. \"What the Welsh government could be doing right now is taking a progressive step to stem the tide of these cancers, and show that it really takes the public health of its citizens seriously. \"We urge them to diverge from central thinking and vaccinate boys now.\" In 2008, a vaccination programme was rolled out in schools and 85 of girls in Wales have been vaccinated. The Welsh government said: \"We will await the committee's recommendations and will consider the implications for Wales of any proposed changes to the HPV vaccination programme.\"",
        "The new polymer PS5 note, which is slightly smaller than its paper predecessor, will be available in branches before becoming more widely available across Scotland. It continues to feature Sir Walter Scott and The Mound on the front, and a bridge theme on the back. All existing paper Bank of Scotland PS5 notes will be gradually withdrawn. However, those that remain in circulation will continue to be accepted at shops, banks and cash payment machines. Bank of Scotland also plans to replace its PS10 paper note with a polymer version next year. The new, plastic material is said to be cleaner and more resilient to being crumpled and spilled on. In September, the Bank of England released new PS5 plastic notes featuring Winston Churchill on the back. It was the first time a polymer note had been circulated by the Bank of England, but other parts of the UK have already been using the material. Polymer banknotes are made from a very thin, flexible, see-through plastic film, with the design printed on special layers of ink on the front and back. Because the main material is see-through, the design can include clear spots that are like little windows you can look straight through. More than 20 countries around the world already use polymer banknotes - they include Scotland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Last year the Clydesdale Bank brought a fully plastic note into circulation in the UK for the first time with a limited commemorative edition PS5 note. As of last week, it entered into full circulation, and has begun to replace the current paper version. The note features Scottish engineering pioneer and entrepreneur Sir William Arrol on the front, along with the Forth Bridge and the Titan Crane. The reverse shows several images of the Forth Bridge. Royal Bank of Scotland's new PS5 plastic note is due to enter circulation on 27 October. It will feature Scottish novelist and poet Nan Shepherd. Scientist Mary Somerville has already been selected for the bank's planned PS10 polymer note, which is due to enter into circulation next year. They will be the first women to appear on the bank's main issue notes.",
        "Martin McCauley was seriously wounded and a teenager was killed when police opened fire on a hayshed in County Armagh in 1982. It later emerged that the security services had secretly recorded what happened. The evidence was not made available to the court during his trial. The 52-year-old, from Lurgan, County Armagh, was arrested along with Niall Connolly and James Monaghan in Colombia in 2001 and accused of IRA training of rebel FARC guerrilla forces. They were initially cleared of the charge, only to be convicted on appeal and sentenced to 17 years in jail. But the three men avoided imprisonment by fleeing Colombia in 2004, turning up in the Republic of Ireland a year later. Even though Mr McCauley faces extradition to South America if he returns to Northern Ireland, the Court of Appeal in Belfast is examining a weapons conviction for which he received a two-year suspended jail sentence. Police claimed Martin McCauley confronted them with a rifle at a hayshed 32 years ago during the so-called RUC shoot to kill incident. He was seriously injured and Michael Tighe was killed when RUC officers opened fire. In 1985, Martin McCauley was convicted of possession of three rifles found inside the shed and given a two-year suspended sentence. He had insisted he and Michael Tighe, had not been armed and that the police opened fire without warning. The police told the court that was not true. Years after his conviction, it was revealed that MI5 had a listening device hidden inside the hayshed at the time of the shooting that recorded what happened. That recording could have re-established whether the police issued any warnings or made any reference to Mr McCauley being armed before they opened fire. The existence of the recording was not made known to the court at the time of his trial. Its existence was discovered by the former Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir John Stalker, as part of his investigation into allegations that the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was operating a shoot to kill policy. He also discovered that the recording was later destroyed. Last year, the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred his case to the Court of Appeal, on the basis that potentially significant material had been withheld from the judge. In a dramatic development on Wednesday, Gerald Simpson QC told the court he had been instructed to read a statement on behalf of the prosecution service. It said material relevant to the decision to prosecute Mr McCauley was withheld from the director of public prosecutions at the time, from the court and from the defence in the trial. The statement said this served only to undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system and to bring it into disrepute. The lawyer told the three Appeal Court judges that the prosecution service would not be making any submissions to uphold the conviction and invited them to exercise their discretion to quash it. The judges will sit next week to decide whether to do so. Mr McCauley's lawyers will argue that the conviction should be quashed on the basis that vital evidence was not available to the trial judge. The contents of John Stalker's investigation into the incident have never been made public. The lawyers hope that will change during next week's hearing. \"Mr McCauley was tried in public, and he was convicted in public and it's his fundamental right that these documents be opened in the public court, so that he and the general public are aware of what actually occurred,\" Mr McCauley's lawyer, Fearghal Shiels, said. Mr McCauley was not in court to hear the prosecution statement on Wednesday as he faces extradition to south America if he returns to Northern Ireland.",
        "Letters from the Department of Environment to a range of organisations that work in areas like tourism, environmental heritage and hills management, began arriving on Wednesday. It is understood a number of high profile organisation are badly affected. In some cases the cuts runs to more than PS200,000. It follows a cut of more than 10 to the department's own budget which was finalised earlier this week. One of the organisations affected is the Northern Ireland Environment Link. Its funding has been cut from PS200,000 to PS50,000. The letter it received said its funding would continue until June, but would be withdrawn after that. Its chief executive Craig McGuicken said: \"We knew that the department had taken a serious cut in the budget, but the sector has been surprised by the severity of this.\" In the letter his organisation received, a departmental official wrote: \"We will pay the relevant portion of our offer of funding for 2015-16 for the three month period from 1 April to 30 June 2015 in accordance with the verification and claim process set out in the letter of offer and to a maximum of PS50,000. \"No further funding will be provided in future financial years in relation to our previous letter of offer. \"I appreciate that this letter will not bring welcome news to you.\" The Belfast Hills Partnership has also been affected. It helps to conserve and promote the mountains around the city. Its core funding from the department has been reduced to zero from PS50,000. Its director Jim Bradley said: \"Although NIEA [Northern Ireland Environment Agency] have been warning us of very drastic cuts, this is much more than just a major cut in funding, it is an end to funding of organisations, many of which NIEA set up to tackle specific needs and issues. \"This has nothing to do with how efficient or effective individual organisations were, it's a wholesale removal of a sector which delivered services much better and at lower costs than government could.\" A representative from the Ulster Wildlife Trust said their annual grant of PS220,000 was being totally cut. She said it would have an impact on jobs. \"We're all very shocked. We expected cuts but not at this level. It will be a very different landscape we're going to be operating in,\" she added. The Mourne Heritage Trust is losing three quarters of its funding for 201516 going from PS225,000 to PS56,000 pounds. Chief Executive Martin Carey said the scale of the cut had come \"as a complete surprise.\" \"As of July 1, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency will not be providing any funding for an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and for the Mourne Heritage Trust which it established.\" He said it would affect the organisation's ability to maintain paths and stiles and collect litter. He said the decision also jeopardised up to PS1,000,000 pounds in 'match funding' from organisations like the Heritage Lottery Fund and Big Lottery Fund.",
        "Julian Lewis, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, said the former prime minister had \"charm and ability.\" But he had \"dangerously\" delayed renewing Trident, Mr Lewis said, also questioning Mr Cameron's roles in Libya, Brexit and armed forces cuts. The ex-PM was mooted as Nato secretary-general over the Christmas period. The incumbent, former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, is due to stand down within the next couple of years. In a speech as part of the Speaker's Lecture series, Mr Lewis said: \"During the Christmas recess, an obviously planted story appeared in a tabloid newspaper suggesting that our most recent former prime minister should be the UK's candidate as next Nato secretary-general. \"It was duly taken up by the wider media, with heavy hints suggesting that Number 10 was actively considering the proposal.\" He added: \"David Cameron is a man of charm and ability. He deserves to find a role commensurate with his talents, and I am sure that he will. \"But those talents do not include wisely judging strategic issues, whether when toppling Arab dictators in places like Libya, increasing military commitments whilst cutting the armed forces, predicting a Third World War in consequence of Brexit, or dangerously delaying the renewal of Trident for the sake of coalition politics - as he did.\" Mr Cameron resigned as prime minister last summer after his Remain campaign lost the EU referendum. He stood down as MP for Witney, Oxfordshire, in September. In an interview with the Times, published on Monday, US President-elect Donald Trump branded Nato \"obsolete\" for failing to adapt to the threat posed by terrorism, but he also said the 28-member military alliance was \"very important.\" Mr Lewis warned that if the US turned away from the organisation, Europe would have \"little chance\" of deterring non-nuclear threats. But he claimed Mr Trump was trying to strengthen the alliance by confronting countries which failed to meet the membership requirement of spending more than 2 of GDP on defence. Mr Lewis said: \"It seems to me far more likely that, by confronting the'free-riders' within the alliance, he actually aims to strengthen Nato by ensuring that all its members properly fund their armed forces in the future.\"",

        "Hamilton said he was drawing on Ali's famous \"rope-a-dope\" victory over George Foreman in 1974 as he seeks to close the 29-point gap to the German. \"I think about Muhammad Ali,\" Hamilton told BBC Sport. \"He sat on the rope and let [Foreman] have the upper hand until he decided it was the right time to turn it around.\" Ahead of Sunday's British Grand Prix, Hamilton, the 2008 world champion, added: \"I'm hoping I can do a similar thing. He inspires me in that fight.\" Hamilton thinks it is important to beat Rosberg this weekend. The Englishman has finished second to his rival in two of the last three races and retired from the other. \"I am going to do everything to be out front,\" said Hamilton, who has had two retirements this year. In contrast, Rosberg has finished every race, winning three grands prix and finishing second five times. \"Winning your home grand prix is one of the greatest experiences you can have as a driver,\" added Hamilton. \"I'm hopeful I don't have any more bad luck with the non-finishes and it's time to turn things around.\" Hamilton has not won at Silverstone since 2008, when he dominated in wet conditions to take one of the greatest victories of his career. Former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button hopes there will be another British victory this weekend but says the pressure is on Hamilton. \"It would be amazing to have a British victory,\" said the 2009 world champion. \"The crowd would go wild. \"For myself, it's going to be tricky to get on the top step. Lewis has got a shot. Let's hope it happens.\" The flowing, fast Silverstone circuit and the huge crowds - 80,000 spectators are expected to attend practice on Friday, with about 95,000 due for Saturday's qualifying and 120,000 for the race on Sunday - make the British Grand Prix a favourite amongst drivers. Rosberg says he will do everything he could to prevent Hamilton recording a home victory on Sunday. \"I definitely am going to try,\" the German said. \"It's not going to be easy here, but I will do my best and I'm optimistic.\" Having won seven of the eight races so far this season, only missing out in Canada last month when they ran into a rare reliability problem, Mercedes are expected to win at Silverstone, with Hamilton and Rosberg fighting it out at the front. World champions Red Bull should be their closest challengers, despite a poor race in Austria two weeks ago. Daniel Ricciardo, who was eighth in Austria, is the highest Red Bull driver in the championship in third place, 82 points behind Rosberg. The Australian, who took his maiden career victory in Canada, said the team said the team think they know what went wrong in Austria and were expecting a better weekend at Silverstone. That's because the plethora of high-speed corners suits the aerodynamic excellence of the Red Bull, while the power disadvantage of the Renault compared to the Mercedes engine is less of a handicap. \"If we can be the strong package we normally are here, it can definitely bring us close to the other teams,\" said Ricciardo. \"All going well, I think we should be the ones behind Mercedes. I think they'll still be quickest but whether that's half a second or two or three tenths [of a second] we'll have to find out. \"If we get it all right we can be within a couple of three tenths from them.\" Ferrari are in a similar situation to Red Bull, with a good car let down by a poor engine, but double world champion Fernando Alonso is pessimistic about his chances of a podium finish at Silverstone. In fact, the Spaniard does not think his team will taste victory at all this season. \"If I'm honest with you, I would say no, it's not possible to win this year,\" Alonso said. \"But I thought in 2011 it was impossible to win a race and we won here. \"Anything can happen in this sport, so we try to do the best we can. If one opportunity arrives, we will take it to win a race, but it is extremely difficult to win with the performance we are showing.\" If Alonso fails to register a win in 2014, it would be the first time since 2009 the 32-year-old has not won at least once in a season and only the second time since 2003. Alonso said he expected Williams drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa, who locked out the front row and finished the race third and fourth in Austria, would again be strong in Silverstone. \"They will be a threat,\" Alonso said.

        "Liam Laverick, 25, from Beeford Grove in Hull has pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter of his four-week old son, Tommy Lee. The baby was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary on 23 September 2014 and died later at Leeds General Infirmary. Tommy Lee had been left in the sole care of Mr Laverick when the baby became ill, Hull Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC said in his opening statement Tommy Lee was left in the care of Mr Laverick at his flat on Linnaeus Street, Hull. He also told the court Mr Laverick had killed his son by shaking or throwing him. The jury was shown CCTV footage of Mr Laverick taking Tommy Lee to a relative's house to find the baby's mother, Kelly Whitworth, before the couple ran with the child to the nearby Hull Royal Infirmary. Mr Laverick gave different accounts of what had happened, including saying that he had fallen over while carrying the child, the prosecution said. A recording of Mr Laverick speaking to Tommy Lee's mother at a police station and made without their knowledge was also played in court. In it Mr Laverick described falling over in the hallway of their flat while carrying the baby. The forensic pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination on the body of Tommy Lee said he had suffered serious bleeding around his brain and the back of his eyes. The case continues.",

Sgt Rayner's wife Wendy led tributes to the \"fantastic\" and \"loving\" husband and father to son, Derek. \"He loved his job and doing something which he believed in. \"He will be sincerely missed by all who knew him,\" she said. Sgt Rayner was born into a military family, and his parents Peter and Bernadette said their son was \"always full of energy and was someone who enjoyed life to the full.\" \"As a soldier he loved his job and was totally committed to the Army, as well as his family and friends. \"As a son and brother, he was a fun-loving and caring person of whom we are all very proud. \"We loved him so dearly and will miss him with all our hearts.\" The MoD said Sgt Rayner, who had also served in Bosnia and Iraq, would be \"sorely missed\" and remembered for his \"pre-eminence as a Javelin Commander, for his forthright manner and for his huge personality.\" Sgt Rayner's bravery and courage had attracted much praise in Afghanistan, it said. Lieutenant Colonel Robbie Boyd, Commanding Officer 2nd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, said: \"He was honest, loyal and always vocal. \"A true Lion of England and a man of high morals, guts and integrity. \"A man who cared not just for the morale of his soldiers, but in how that morale was created. \"A man with great spirit and forthrightness, who was as true as his aim was with a Javelin Missile.\" Major Paul Tingey, Officer Commanding Arnhem Company, 2nd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, said Sgt Rayner left a \"lasting impression\" on people. \"He spoke his mind and always had the best interests of his men at heart. \"He was someone that you could rely on to tell you exactly what he thought. I always welcomed his words of advice. \"I will remember Skippy as a devoted family man, a fanatical mountain biker and one of the best commanders that I have had the privilege to work with,\" he said.",
        "Marks, from Kenfig Hill, Bridgend county, announced last year he had been diagnosed with inoperable bowel cancer. Jailed in the US in 1990 after being convicted of smuggling cannabis, he recalled his exploits in a best-selling autobiography, Mr Nice, which was later made into a film starring Rhys Ifans. The father of four stood for election to Parliament in 1997 on a single-issue ticket of reforming cannabis laws. Marks also regularly toured a one-man show in which he recounted stories about drug smuggling and his time in prison. The life of'Mr Nice' Howard Marks No regrets as Marks lives with cancer A statement said: \"In the early hours of 10th April 2016, Howard Marks died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by his four loving children. \"He fought the illness with grace and humour. \"His death was 21 years to the day since his release from prison in the United States, his second bout of imprisonment for cannabis smuggling since his miraculous acquittal at the Old Bailey in 1980. \"One of his last acts was to set up the Mr Nice foundation, to ensure the causes dear to him continue to receive his support.\" Revealing his illness in January 2015, Marks said he had \"no regrets\" about his life. His drug smuggling began in the 1970s after he graduated from Oxford University with a degree in physics. In 1988, he was arrested in Spain as part of a US Drug Enforcement Agency-led operation and extradited to Florida. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison and released on parole in 1995 for good behaviour. As well as the film version of Mr Nice, Marks had cameo roles in the movie Human Traffic and appeared on TV including on the BBC quiz show Never Mind the Buzzcocks. He also collaborated on songs with the Super Furry Animals and made appearances at the Glastonbury festival. A sequel to Mr Nice, Senor Nice, came out in 2006, and five years later Marks published a crime novel, Sympathy for the Devil.",
        "It means the number of nursing homes and nursing beds has fallen for the first time in five years. A total of 73 homes cancelled their registration in the first six months of 2016, the Care Quality Commission said, partly due to recruiting problems. The Department of Health said nurse training places were being increased. In the year 2015-2016, the number of nursing homes in England fell from 4,697 to 4,633 and the number of their beds reduced from 224,674 to 224,026, reversing the increase seen over the previous five years. And 73 homes cancelled the element of their registration that is required to operate as a nursing home in the first half of 2016, compared with 72 in the whole of 2015. The BBC has produced an online guide to the system which shows how it works and how much care costs wherever you live in the UK. You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating. average amount of care provided per week, by your council average paid per hour by your council, 2014-15 average paid per hour in your region if you pay for your own care, 2016 You live in a care home that provides round-the-clock support with everyday tasks. TBC pay for their own care You live in a care home which provides round-the-clock support for everyday tasks and nursing care. Depending on your medical needs, the NHS may contribute to your costs. TBC pay for their own care Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there. Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of adult social care at the CQC, told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme, said: \"One of the fundamental reasons is that we are seeing that homes are having difficulty recruiting and retaining nurses. \"There are about 47,000 nurses working in adult social care. There is about a 9 vacancy rate, which will mean they are depending on agency nurses. And over the last year a third of nurses left their job. \"So, we're having difficulty recruiting them and then we are having difficulty retaining them, and that will have a direct impact on the quality of care that people are receiving.\" The regulator changed the way it carried out inspections in 2014, and care homes are now judged on whether they are'safe, effective, caring, responsive, and well-led. The CQC said: \"The quality of nursing home care continues to be rated lower than other adult social care services.\" It said 40 are currently rated as either \"requiring improvement\" or \"inadequate,\" with 60 rated \"good\" and 1 \"outstanding.\" But Frank Ursell, of the Registered Nursing Home Association, is predicting the number of closures will get worse. This] ought to be concerning because the demography is telling us we have got an ageing population,\" he said. \"We've never had any control over the supply of nurses. so we've always had to rely upon the supply of nurses that are trained by the NHS. \"If the number of nurses they're training isn't sufficient to meet both the health and social care needs then we are going to have a problem. \" The Department of Health said it was funding a PS40m leadership programme to create more senior nurses, as well as undergraduate nurse apprentices and student nurse placements in care homes. But, many home owners cannot wait that long, with a range of factors - including reduced CQC ratings -putting potential residents off, and making the business unsustainable. Home owner Andrew Uter recently shut his nursing home in Bath after 32 years. He said: \"We decided to close our home for a variety of reasons. I think one of the main reasons homes are closing nowadays is due to staffing difficulties, but also to some extent regulatory difficulties and difficulties with funding. \"The struggle over the last few years with those elements has become so much that we felt it better for our size, a smaller more intimate home, to close and to move on.' 'First of all we recruited through an agency from Spain, but in the end we had to go further afield and we went to agencies in Portugal. We also tried to recruit from India and the Philippines.\" Often however, candidates would get a better offer elsewhere and not accept the job. Mr Uter's nursing home was rated as \"requiring improvement\" and then \"inadequate,\" and he says being told to roster on four nurses overnight was \"the straw that broke the camel's back.\" Agency rates are higher than staff rates. An agency nurse might typically get PS22 an hour, the agency fee is PS28 and so the nursing home would be paying a total of PS50 per hour. The pressure on the sector has seen a number of key players reducing or cutting their nursing beds. HC-1 the third largest care home company in the UK say nursing shortages have been a contributing factor in the fate of 12 of their homes which they have either closed or turned into residential homes. Anchor, the not-for-profit operator said it has pulled out of running nursing homes altogether to focus on retirement housing, assisted living and residential care. Avery Healthcare at the more luxury end of the market has reduced its 3,000 nursing beds by about 20 with more reductions expected. And Four Seasons Care, which is the UK's biggest provider, needs 4,000 nurses on its books, but it is currently 700 nurses short. Health Education England recently announced a new Nursing Associate role, and some care providers are dealing with the nursing shortage by starting their own training schemes to improve senior care workers' skills. Funding remains a key problem for nursing homes owners. The Department of Health has recently raised the NHS-funded Nursing Care Rate in England. It is a fee paid to care homes looking after people receiving nursing care. The rate rose from PS112 per week to PS156. Many care providers say that's about half what it costs to pay nurses to provide nursing care.",
        "Jacob Brentnall drove to Manchester from his home in Nottingham after midnight when he read about the bombing in the news and on social media. After giving a young woman a lift across the city he drove a family of three to Leeds, before returning home. The 21-year-old then turned up for work in Derby despite getting no sleep. Mr Brentnall said the attack made him feel \"sick to my stomach\" but it had been heartening to see people pulling together. \"I saw lots of other people tweeting to ask if people needed a place to sleep or anything like that, or if people needed lifts,\" said Mr Brentnall, who works as an engineer. \"I was under the assumption people would need help and I was in a position to be able to help, I guess it was as simple as that. \"Although something this traumatic has happened, everyone has been capable of pulling together and doing what needs to be done.\" He said the family he took to Leeds were visibly \"shook up.\" \"The father said they were out of the immediate area but it was still quite traumatic for them,\" said Mr Brentnall. \"The mother and daughter were asleep within a couple of minutes and the dad was pale all the way back. He was still in shock. \"They were very grateful and couldn't say thank you enough.\" Mr Brentnall also praised the work of the emergency services. \"They were on it straight away,\" he said. \"Everyone was running away from it but they were running to it.

        "The measures are outlined in the Digital Economy Bill, which was published on Tuesday. It says phone operators could be penalised if they miss coverage targets and other licence commitments made to the sector's regulator. And it sets out how a separate watchdog could punish adult sites that fail to check their visitors' ages. Other measures include: If the bill is passed, Ofcom would be able to fine mobile networks a maximum PS20,000 a day, up to a total sum of PS2m, if they fail to hit agreed service goals. The regulator has suggested this would give it \"more flexibility in our important work to manage and ensure optimal use of spectrum.\" \"At the moment, when a provider breaches its licence, in most cases our only sanction is to remove the licence completely, or launch criminal proceedings,\" a spokesman said. \"The bill would allow Ofcom alternatively to impose financial penalties, which may in some cases be a more proportionate means of securing compliance.\" The law also proposes creating a separate age-verification regulator, which will be told to publish guidelines about how sites should ensure their users are aged 18 or older. It says this body should be able to fine pornographers up to PS250,000 if they fail to comply. Details of how this would work in practice have still to be determined. But the bill states that the watchdog would be able to alert credit cards and other payment providers as well as other companies providing a service to the sites in cases where it cannot persuade their owners to comply. One detail not mentioned in the bill is that the new broadband universal service obligation (USO) should set 10Mbps as the minimum download speed. However, a factsheet issued by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport does refer to this as being its \"ambition.\" \"Ofcom has reported that 10Mbps is the speed needed for a USO, given a typical household's use of digital services, and is adequate for demanding services like streaming high definition video content,\" it says. \"The speed will be specified in regulations to allow it to be updated when necessary. \"Regulations can be updated in a much shorter timescale than a new bill, which can take a year before it can be brought into force.\" Assuming there are no major amendments to the bill, one industry watcher said its impact would probably be determined by how tough the two regulators were willing to be. \"No matter how the law gets written, it's how the regulators implement it and who they chase for non-compliance that determines its real-world effect,\" said Andrew Ferguson, from the Thinkbroadband news site. \"Ofcom has a history of being a light-touch regulator - it tends to concentrate on market failures rather than trying to drive the whole market forward.\"",
        "A Munster statement said O'Connell, 36, would provide \"invaluable technical expertise and advice\" to the Irish province's next generation of players. \"Every club in the world would love to have an iconic figure such as Paul O'Connell involved in their set-up,\" said Munster chief Garret Fitzgerald. O'Connell made 174 Munster appearances and earned 108 Ireland caps. \"As a Limerick native and proud Munster and Irishman who has played and led teams for Munster, Ireland and the Lions, we were very eager to secure his services in some capacity,\" added Fitzgerald. \"An appointment such as this is a further boost to our academy staff and young players, and to the organisation as a whole.\" The Limerick man, who played on three British Irish Lions tours, was forced to retire from the game in February after being unable to recover from serious hamstring injury sustained at last year's World Cup. The injury meant that O'Connell was forced to cancel his contract with French club Toulon. Former Lions captain O'Connell spent 14 seasons at Munster and helped the province win two European Cup titles and three Celtic Leagues. O'Connell was also part of Ireland's Grand Slam winning team in 2009 and captained his country to successive Six Nations titles in 2014 and 2015.

        "Deila will leave Premiership champions Celtic after Sunday's match against Motherwell. The Norwegian led the club to two titles and a League Cup win, but they were unable to reach the Champions League group stage this term and last. \"We did not play as well as was needed,\" said Sweden player Lustig. \"Of course Celtic always want to be in the Champions League, but at the same time, he is not to blame. The players are the ones out there. \"When we went out of the Champions League, we should have been the better team, but we were not at that standard.\" Lustig feels it would be \"a little bit harsh\" to regard Deila's reign as a failure and said: \"Hopefully the manager gets a good reception on Sunday. \"He's been here for two years now and obviously we wanted something more, but he has brought titles to the club and I think he's going to get a good send-off. \"We want to have a good win for the manager and make sure the last game is memorable.\" Deila announced after a Scottish Cup semi-final defeat on penalties to Rangers that he would be moving on at the end of the season. He will leave behind a large squad, of which Lustig said: \"There is a lot of players in the same positions and that's maybe one of the weaknesses that we have. \"We don't have 11 to 15 players who are always in the first team - there have been a lot of changes between games. \"Of course everyone wants to play, but when you try to keep everyone satisfied, it ends up them maybe starting one game but then the next they are not in the squad. \"Or, from not being in the squad one week, you start the next game. \"As a player, you want to know if you're a first-team player or if your role is to come on for the last 20 minutes. \"So maybe there has been a little bit too much changing about. \"We will see what the new manager wants to do with the club.

        "The NHS spent PS8.84m on private ambulances in the capital last year compared to PS795,000 in 2011, according to Freedom of Information data. The London Ambulance Service (LAS) conceded it was losing staff due to \"pressure on the organisation.\" But LAS denied claims it had employed private staff previously sacked by the NHS. Heidi Alexander, Labour MP for Lewisham East, claimed London ambulances were taking \"on average two minutes longer than three years ago\" to respond to the most serious call-outs. Labour said its research discovered private ambulance usage by ambulance trusts across the country grew by 82 between financial years 201112 and 201314, from PS37m to PS67.5m last year. Private ambulance spending In Yorkshire and the North East more than quadrupled to hit PS3.56m and PS2.9m respectively, said Labour, although other ambulance services maintained low spending during the two years, while one trust reduced its reliance on private vehicles. Shadow health minister Jamie Reed raised concerns over the figures and the \"increasing use\" of private ambulances during health questions in the House of Commons. But his comments were branded \"absolute nonsense\" by public health minister Jane Ellison, who said that previous Labour government \"occasionally deployed private ambulances too.\" Brendan Kemp, regional organiser for the GMB union, questioned the hiring practices of ambulance trusts and their ability to keep staff. \"Who's checking the qualifications of the staff that man these vehicles?\" he said on BBC London 94.9. \"Often staff that have been dismissed by London Ambulance Service for something, often they'll reappear working for a private contractor.\" But Jason Killens, director of operations for the LAS, said every private contractor \"is checked by us before we use them.\" \"Staff that leave the LAS for reasons of clinical safety would not be redeployed on those private contracts with us,\" he told BBC London 94.9. Mr Killens said increasing demand each year \"is adding pressure in the organisation\" and conceded that \"some staff leave\" as a result, with about 500 vacancies currently unfilled. He added: \"There is a small number that leave us and go and work in the private sector, but the vast majority of people that leave the ambulance service in London go to work elsewhere in the NHS.\"",
        "To secure more rights for people with disabilities, she makes frequent visits to courtrooms where the world of beauty contests is but a dream. But the first Miss Wheelchair India contest in Mumbai in late November changed much of that. She found herself amid the humdrum of the green room, glitter of the stage and the usual chatter one associates with a beauty pageant. But there were some marked differences - the stage was much smaller than the ones set up for Miss India pageant and the contestants were treated as winners even before the event started. Ms Kewlani's reply is an emphatic \"no\" when asked if the smaller stage and venue dimmed the importance of India's first Miss Wheelchair contest. \"Nobody really cared about how many people attended the event or how big the stage was. It was a night to celebrate the courage and fighting spirit of the contestants. We all won that night.\" She says that her \"rich and challenging\" life has taken another positive turn after winning the contest. \"Polio made me wheelchair-bound early on in life but I never saw it as a disability and worked hard to be trained as a media professional like other normal people in the country. \"And winning the pageant is just another way of showing that disability cannot stop you from feeling and looking beautiful,\" the 41-year-old says. Divya Arora feels her first runner-up crown has strengthened her belief that \"beauty is boundless.\" Ms Arora, who earlier worked for a leading newspaper, says her faith that \"disability can never overshadow her beauty and abilities\" helped her do well in the pageant. The contest is the idea of tax consultant Sounak Banerjee whose life changed in 2006 when muscular dystrophy forced him to use a wheelchair to get around in the bustling city of Mumbai. Mr Banerjee liked watching Bollywood films and TV shows but often found the absence of people with disabilities in the entertainment industry \"disturbing.\" \"Disabled people are also consumers of the entertainment industry but they are seldom represented,\" he says. He then came up with the idea of the Miss Wheelchair India contest to fill the gap and provide a platform they could call their own. Planning the event was tough due to a lack of funding and human resources, he says but adds that the struggles were forgotten when the final day approached. \"I felt satisfied and happy when I saw these women wearing their best costumes and a winning smile. It all came together nicely in the end - I had done something for these courageous contestants,\" he says. \"I found the contest very unique because it honoured beauty irrespective of contestants' physical disabilities,\" says scientist Gopika Anand, 31, who won the second runner-up crown. Ms Anand met with a road accident while studying engineering and was soon confined to a wheelchair. But she persevered, completed her course and found work as a scientist at a leading consumer manufacturing firm. Shelly Bhutani, another contestant, hopes that the corporate world will take notice of the event in the future. \"I feel we too deserve to be in front of the camera and get brand endorsements like Miss India winners,\" she says. Ms Arora, however, felt the organisers were not well prepared for the event and did not provide the kind of support she had hoped for. Mr Banerjee accepts that a lack of sponsorship made the job of organising the event tough. \"I agree that there were problems at the event. We will work harder and hope that more people will support the event next year,\" he says. But other contestants want to see change at a more basic level. India is not known to be a disabled-friendly country as most public places, monuments and buildings do not have facilities catering to their specific needs. Bhavna Sharma, who won the contest in a category that honoured people who are disabled but not necessarily confined to a wheelchair, says citizens with disabilities do not feel inferior and have achieved success in almost every field. \"But it's the country's poor infrastructure for disabled people that lets us down,\" the 27-year-old says. Some years ago Neenu Kewlani travelled all over India in a chauffer-driven car to highlight the problems faced by those with physical challenges while commuting. She says the problem is even more severe in rural areas and smaller towns where people with disabilities are virtually confined to their homes. Nearly every contestant expressed concern over a lack of sensitivity about disability rights. But not one of them is willing to give up hope. Ms Kewlani says there is a long way to go in making India a disabled-friendly country but \"we are not ready to give up as we are fighters.\" \"Facilities are improving in cities but we will continue to put pressure on governments to ensure they provide better opportunities and infrastructure for the disabled,\" she adds. Calcutta-based Sarmistha Sinha says disability rights activists will have to continue fighting like other marginalised sections of the society. An accident in 2006 confined the 41-year-old doctor to a wheelchair, but she says her \"thoughts and ability to stay positive remained free.\" Ms Sinha won in a category which honoured married women in a wheelchair. But winning was not everything for her as she wanted to use the platform to showcase her talent. The wheelchair dancer saw the contest as an opportunity to present her skills and meet people like herself from all over the country. \"I only wanted to dance as such opportunities are rare but the feeling that I have won a beauty pageant is slowly sinking in,\" she adds. For Gopika Anand the real winning moment came when she saw her father's moist eyes as the results were announced. \"I was overwhelmed to see her with the crown. I am very proud today to be recognised as Gopika Anand's father,\" says Anand Mohan. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

        "The Swans dropped back into the bottom three after losing to Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday - their third defeat in their last four games. Clement's side were leading 1-0 after 88 minutes but a remarkable late turnaround saw Spurs triumph 3-1. \"The fact we've come out with nothing is heart-breaking,\" said Clement. He continued: \"The players know the situation. We're in the bottom three and there are seven games to go, and West Ham [Swansea's next opponents] are a team who've had their own troubles recently so we have to go there believing we can get a result. \"We need to get a result, especially in the next two games because the games are running out now.\" While Tottenham's stunning victory kept alive their title challenge, defeat at the Liberty Stadium was a damaging blow to Swansea's hopes of survival. Their misery was compounded by a win for relegation rivals Hull over Middlesbrough, which leaves the Swans 18th in the Premier League table and two points adrift of safety. They are five points behind West Ham, who are in 15th place, and Clement is hopeful of having top scorer Fernando Llorente back from an ankle injury in time for Saturday's game against the Hammers. \"Things are very tight still. There are seven games to go and a lot of points to play for,\" Clement added. \"We have to be encouraged by our performance for long periods of that game.

        "Two separate reports have suggested it could be an ideal site for a new small module reactor (SMR). About 300 workers are decommissioning the plant which began in 1995, two years after it ceased operating. It is due to enter a care and maintenance period in 2016. Ninety redundancies were announced in April. Darryl Williams from the Unite union said: \"We would welcome anything that would keep local skills in the area.\" A report by the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee has called on the UK government to drive forward the development of SMRs.

In November, the Equality and Human Rights Commission said that, overall, black people were six times more likely than white people to be stopped, with Asian or other ethnic minority groups two times more likely to be stopped. On 4 December, Home Secretary Theresa May wrote seeking approval from the cabinet's home affairs committee to a \"package of measures.\" This included a plan to \"amend section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 so that the test for the power's use is'necessary' and'expedient', (to prevent incidents involving serious violence).\" Under Section 60, police can stop and search someone for weapons in a designated area, for a specific time, without suspicion that the individual is involved in wrongdoing. However, a senior officer must hold a reasonable belief that violence has happened or may occur in the area. Mrs May told cabinet colleagues she intended to \"raise the level of authorisation to a senior officer who must reasonably believe that violence'will' take place (as opposed to'may .\" She continued: \"I expect this to reduce significantly the number of stop and searches under section 60. Section 60 is only one kind of stop and search.\" One minister told Newsnight's chief correspondent Laura Kuenssberg that \"we all want to get on\" with the changes. But sources told her they feared \"there's just a lack of will, a fear of looking soft on crime.\" The Liberal Democrats agree with the proposals and Labour has offered cross party talks to push the policy forward. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"Instead of internal rows over this, Theresa May should accept our offer to work together to change stop and search.\" The prime minister's former adviser on youth and crime, Shaun Bailey, said: \"Not getting stop and search right, certainly in urban communities, would be very dangerous because I believe it breeds criminals. \"If I was talking to someone in government I'd say:'Take the brave pill, you'll be rewarded for taking the brave pill and reforming stop and search'.\" He added: \"There's many communities up and down the country who are divorced from politics and feel that the forces-that-be don't represent them and don't care about them. This would be a massive message in the right direction.\" While filming in Brixton, south London, Newsnight spoke to a teenager who said he had been stopped and searched as an 11 year-old. \"Since then I've despised them [the police] more and more because for me they are like criminals in fancy dress,\" he said. \"They've got such a big mob mentality.\" Another young man said he had been stopped and searched by the police \"over 100 times\" because he was \"in a black neighbourhood\" where the police \"think everyone is a drug dealer.\" Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe agreed that random stop and search powers had created distrust between some communities and the police in London. He said over the last two years the Met had reduced the number of stop and searches by over a third, while doubling the number of arrests to one in five. \"We employ human beings, they make mistakes and when we make a mistake - particularly with someone who's innocent of any crime, and frankly never will be guilty of any crime - we leave a really bad imprint on that child, on that family, so it's important we get it right. \"But I think it's an important power, that used wisely, is really effective.\"",
        "Daniel Braxton was driving through Towyn, Conwy county, with his 18-year-old daughter at 07:15 BST on Tuesday. She thought she saw a dead baby in the bus stop near the Magpie and Stump pub and screamed at her father to drive back to check, which he did. Mr Braxton, 35, said he saw the lifeless naked baby on the ground, with her umbilical cord still attached. \"We blocked the road off and rang the emergency services,\" he told BBC Radio Wales. \"I had a dressing gown in the car and ran to grab that, wrapped the baby up, gave her some good hard rubs on the chest and the head. \"She took one big gulp of breath and opened her beautiful little eyes.\" Mr Braxton, who is originally from Birmingham and living in nearby Pensarn, said they guessed that the baby was less than one hour old. \"To be honest, I think the fatherly instinct and the adrenaline kicked in because my daughter was hysterical and my partner was hysterical,\" he added. \"So it was just a case of as soon as I saw her lying there, her naked little body just left on cold concrete, I knew something had to be done.\" Mr Braxton said police have told him that the baby has \"stabilised and is on her way to a full recovery.\" Police are concerned about the welfare of the baby's mother and have urged her to come forward. Helen Douglas, of North Wales Police, said: \"We are concerned about the health of the mother of the baby girl and are appealing for her to come forward. \"Alternatively, if anyone knows who the mother is or can provide any information which may assist in identifying her please contact North Wales Police. \"We want to ensure that the mother is provided with the medical support she needs.\"",

His wife Gemma said: \"He's heavily sedated because they're waiting for the swelling on his brain to go down.\" James Flanagan 35, of Marsden Street, Kentish Town, has been charged with causing grievous bodily harm. Scotland Yard said it was called to an altercation between two men outside Bethnal Green station at about 01:00 GMT and found 36-year-old Mr Carter, from Greater Manchester, with head injuries. Mrs Carter, who has been married to Gary for four years, said: \"I'm trying to stay calm and keep positive and draw on all the support that I'm getting from social media and the family to stay strong for Gaz. \"I've just replied to a tweet from Alan Shearer and I'm getting them from lots of rugby league players and managers. They're coming from all over the world. It's amazing and it really lifts us. It just goes to show how well-respected he is.\" Former Newcastle United and England footballer Shearer tweeted: \"Best wishes to garyCarter1979 for a full recovery after suffering an awful attack last week.\" Mr Carter was admitted to the Royal London Hospital on Friday and immediately taken to surgery to remove a blood clot from his brain. The freelance sports journalist had travelled from Manchester to London on Thursday to report on Saturday's England's v New Zealand game game at the Olympic Stadium. Mrs Carter said she had last spoken to him after he had arrived in the capital. She said: \"He texted me a picture and apologised for having to work away all the time and that was the last I heard from him. \"A police woman knocked on the door at about 02:20 and she said he had been involved in an incident. We drove straight down and I was saying prayers repeatedly. \" Mr Carter, a journalist since leaving school, often works for The Sun. His wife said: \"He absolutely loves his job and rugby league with a passion.

We're all supporting him.\" A 22-year-old man was also arrested in connection with the incident on suspicion of affray towards attending paramedics. He has been bailed.",
        "Up to a dozen A-29 Super Tucano aircraft would be sold to Nigeria to help fight Islamist militant group Boko Haram, unnamed US officials said. The deal, which is not yet official, will require approval from Congress. Boko Haram's deadly insurgency has displaced more than two million people. The deal, said to be worth up to 600m (PS490m), was agreed by the Obama administration, but was reportedly halted on the day it was due to be sent to Congress, after a catastrophic incident involving the Nigerian military. About 90 people, mainly women and children, were killed in January when the Nigerian Air Force mistakenly bombed a camp in the country's north-east, which was hosting thousands of those who had fled Boko Haram. An aid distribution was taking place at the time of the attack, according to medical charity MSF. The Nigerian government indicated last month that the deal might be back on, following the first phone call between President Muhammadu Buhari and President Donald Trump. \"President Trump assured the Nigerian president of US readiness to cut a new deal in helping Nigeria in terms of military weapons to combat terrorism,\" Mr Buhari's office said in a statement. The US congressional source said human rights concerns remain, despite support for the sale from some lawmakers, Reuters news agency reports. The US Air Force described the A-29 aircraft as a \"game-changer\" when they were deployed in Afghanistan in 2016. They can be armed with two wing-mounted machine guns and can carry up to 1,550 kg of weapons. But the aircraft that would be sold to Nigeria come with a \"very basic armed configuration,\" one of the unnamed US officials told Reuters.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device McIlroy, 28, suffered a recurrence of a rib injury at the Players Championship. However, he said on Tuesday there would be \"no limitations\" on his swing when he opens up at Erin Hills on Thursday. \"I'm totally fine to play. It's just a matter of limiting my practice,\" said the world number two, who confirmed he will play in the Scottish Open in July. The rib stress fracture, which McIlroy suffered in the close season, flared up as he lost a play-off to Graeme Storm at the South Africa Open in January. McIlroy was ruled out for a number of tournaments in January and February but after returning to action, he felt the injury again at the Players Championship. The Northern Irishman was forced to pull out of the PGA Championship at Wentworth and also missed the Memorial Tournament in America, which meant he has had no warm-up events in advance of the season's second major. However, the 2011 US Open champion was upbeat on Tuesday as he spoke of his preparations for the event in Wisconsin. \"I don't feel like I need a run of events to get back into it,\" added McIlroy, who will play in the Scottish Open at Dundonald in order to fine tune his links preparation for the following week's Open Championship. \"Preparation-wise, instead of hitting five bags of balls I'll hit two. If you hit 100 drivers a day and you swing at 120mph, it's going to take its toll a little bit. So it's just a matter of managing that.\" The long-hitting McIlroy added that he wasn't upset to see the rain falling heavily on Tuesday on the already lengthy 7,693-yard course. \"I wasn't crying when I saw that rain this morning. That's a long golf course that's only going to play longer,\" continued the four-time major winner, who is using a new putter this week.",
        "From April 2017, 600,000 small firms will not have to pay business rates, while 250,000 will pay lower rates. To fund the giveaway, the chancellor capped debt interest payments used by larger firms to cut their corporation tax bills, to 30 of earnings. George Osborne also said corporation tax would be cut to 17 by 2020. Mr Osborne said his business tax reforms were part of a \"Budget for small business.\" The chancellor announced he was permanently raising the threshold for small business rate relief from PS6,000 to a maximum of PS15,000 and increasing higher rate relief from PS18,000 to PS51,000. He said that the 600,000 small businesses relieved of paying business rates from next April would see an annual saving of nearly PS6,000. Mike Cherry, policy director at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"The chancellor has listened to our calls for the tax system to be made simpler for small businesses and the self-employed and taken important action on business rates.\" The chancellor also announced a number of reforms designed to help small businesses cope with what he called \"the great unfairness\" they faced when trying to compete with some suppliers selling goods online. Mr Osborne said the government would take measures to stop overseas retailers storing goods in the UK and then selling the goods online without paying VAT. He also introduced two new tax-free allowances worth PS1,000 a year for so-called micro-entrepreneurs: people who make money from occasional jobs or through renting out property they own. The Treasury estimates that the debt interest rate relief cap, alongside other measures, will help raise PS8bn over the next five years. Among those other measures was the announcement that firms making an annual profit of over PS5m would face the prospect of having the amount of past losses they could carry forward to offset their corporation tax bill capped to 50 of current profits. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI business lobby group, said: \"The reduction in the headline corporation tax rate sends out a strong signal that the UK is open for global business investment, and reforms to interest deductibility are rightly in line with the international consensus. But she added: \"Changes to the tax treatment of losses will make it harder for larger scale-up firms and companies that have been through tough times to play their part in the recovery.\"",
        "Speaking at the London Guildhall, Mr Valls said the British media consistently portrayed France as \"left-wing and anti-business.\" Earlier in the day, Mr Valls met David Cameron in Downing Street. The two prime ministers spoke about the ongoing threat of European recruits to Islamic State, as well as economic co-operation. Mr Valls, a member of the French Socialist Party, was appointed prime minister by President Francois Hollande in March. Chancellor George Osborne was also in attendance. Mr Cameron said the two nations were \"strong allies\" who faced \"the same challenge in responding to Isil [Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant] in Iraq and Syria.\" He added that although he and his French counterpart were from \"different political families,\" he was confident \"there is a lot we can share in terms of experience about what needs to happen\" in the future. The two men also discussed immigration in the European Union. A Downing Street spokesman said: \"The prime minister raised the issue of free movement and said it should not be an unqualified right.\" \"The prime minister thanked Prime Minister Valls for their co-operation in stronger security measures at Calais, and they agreed that more should be done across Europe to reduce the pull factors and to get countries where migrants arrive first to take responsibility for them.\" In his speech to a group of financiers and executives in the City of London, Mr Valls said sections of the British media and business classes needed to get past a \"caricature\" of France. He opened the speech by saying: \"A French prime minister in the City is an event - a socialist French prime minister in the City is a revolution. \"Every day I read your press, I listen and I watch what is being said about France. Too often I see in some of your newspapers some bias, prejudices and attacks as well,\" he said, with a tendency to portray France as \"left-wing and anti-business.\" He also referenced the comments of John Lewis managing director Andy Street, who apologised last week after describing France as a nation \"in decline\" and saying he would advise anyone with investments in the country to \"get them out quickly.\" Mr Valls said on Monday: \"Let me remind this British businessman who all of a sudden had some sort of startling vision and said that France was finished. \"He has presented excuses and apologised, and I would like to thank him for doing that, because he had forgotten that France was the fifth-largest economy in the world and second in Europe.\" Describing his government as \"pro-business,\" Mr Valls went on to say that the 75 tax rate on high earners introduced by President Hollande would be reversed next year. He also announced that shops and museums in France would soon be permitted to open on Sundays. The visit comes in the wake of news last week that the European Commission is likely to reject France's draft budget at the end of this month, invoking for the first time its power to demand changes to a national budget. The commission will do so to ensure France meets its deficit reduction target of ensuring the deficit is under 3 of GDP by 2015. Mr Valls said this was \"technically speaking simply not possible,\" and the French government has said 2017 will be the earliest it can reach this goal.",
        "First, though, the German has to negotiate one of the most intense weekends of the year. The Brazilian Grand Prix throbs with a passion and fervour matched by few others. Interlagos and Sao Paulo are inextricably linked with Formula 1 even if the days of a winning Brazilian driver may be some time in the past. Brazil's first legendary grand prix driver, Emerson Fittipaldi, was born there, and his successes on the world stage laid the path for all others to follow. Ayrton Senna was, likewise, a Paulista, and is buried in Morumbi cemetery a few miles away. He was a hero to Rubens Barrichello, who grew up metres from the race track and forged his passion watching Senna there, before graduating to F1 a couple of years before his death, befriending him, and then taking up his mantle. Felipe Massa, another local boy, followed suit. The fans know the glory days have long gone, that a Brazilian victory is as unlikely as a day without a traffic jam in one of the world's most crowded cities. But still they come, packing the grandstands and singing and chanting from early in the day. What draws them there? A deep-seated passion for the sport, for one. The almost-certainty of a great sporting spectacle, for another. Interlagos has a knack for producing exciting races. Drama is synonymous with the track, not least because of its position at the business end of the season. It is a claustrophobic place. The circuit winds around a natural amphitheatre, high on a hill, the sprawl of Sao Paulo both a backdrop and crushing in from all sides. The heavy humidity, and almost-permanent threat of rain, add to the atmosphere. It feels locked in, and not just because of the cramped old paddock, a fraction of the size of anything Bernie Ecclestone finds acceptable these days. The track is a splash of vibrant green in an ocean of concrete grey and smog brown; the city butting up against the perimeter fence, endless tower blocks filling the skyline. Twenty years ago, a favela sprawled up the hill all the way to the perimeter wall. There has been an attempt to spruce things up a bit, the old corrugated-roof shacks replaced by flats closest to the circuit, houses of naked breeze blocks a bit further down the road. But down at heel, to say the least, it remains. There is an unmistakable edge. The road up to Interlagos is not a place for a stranger to linger. Inside, the track feels like a haven. One of the shortest laps on the calendar somehow packs in a long straight - superb for overtaking - and a challenging sequence of long corners, the best the uphill double right-hander of Ferra DuraLaranha and the fast downhill left of Mergulho. It's a great race track, with emphasis on the \"race.\" They are corners with a history - the new track is about half of the old one. Part of a previous era, it was a magnificent five miles of twists and turns, uphill and down, which started with two incredible, banked, high-speed left-handers, taken absolutely flat out by some, still visible outside the modern Turns One, Two and Three. It all adds to the character of the place. Loud, intimidating, crazy, invigorating, rough-around-the-edges. But, in its own way, brilliant.

        "The Reds led in the 15th minute when Divock Origi flicked in from close range before Roberto Firmino made it 2-0, heading in Nathaniel Clyne's cross. Origi also went close when his low shot was saved by Stephen Bywater. Tom Naylor inadvertently put the ball in his own net after the break before Daniel Sturridge tapped in his first and then thumped home the Reds' fifth. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp made only four changes from the XI that started in the 2-0 league defeat at Burnley on Saturday. The quality of the visiting team was soon apparent at the Pirelli Stadium against a Burton side who have had a mixed start to their first ever season in the Championship. After Liverpool's Belgian forward Origi cleverly profited from tricky work in the box from Sadio Mane, Brazilian Firmino doubled the lead following a terrible throw-out from goalkeeper Bywater. It was 3-0 just after the hour when the unfortunate Naylor had little time to react as James Milner's ball came towards him at pace. And substitute Sturridge then grabbed a late double, converting at the far post from Milner's pass before firing in low from 15 yards. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"There were still a few situations where we were missing a bit of sharpness but the main problem was, it was unbelievable, our build-up and style of play at Burnley - one more pass but 15 times we are completely free in the box. \"So we needed to use this game and that's what we did and it was better.\" Burton manager Nigel Clough: \"It's difficult for our lads to compete with that sort of quality. With this being 72 hours before the Derby game, our focus was always with that one. \"When you think we finished with a couple of teenagers and a 20- or 21-year-old, you could train with them for a couple of seasons and not gain the experience they've got tonight.\"",

        "The archive of travel writer, war hero and adventurer Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor has been catalogued by the National Library of Scotland. The collection includes letters from Prince Charles and Truman Capote. Sir Patrick, who was known as Paddy, died in 2011 at the age of 96. He published several books on his travels around the world and one of the most prized items in the archive is the only surviving notebook from his 1933 trek across Europe. The trek provided the material for his most famous books,'A Time of Gifts','Between the Woods and the Water' and'The Broken Road'. Thousands of items which occupy 16 metres of shelving took a year to be catalogued by library staff. Along with letters from notable 20th century figures they also uncovered literary manuscripts, sketches and what appears to be an unpublished John Betjeman poem on the back of an envelope. Sir Patrick spent much of World War Two on Nazi-occupied Crete. During his time there he disguised himself as a shepherd to organise guerrilla operations against the Nazis. He led one of the most daring feats of the war in 1944, capturing the commander of the German garrison on Crete. The 1957 film starring Dirk Bogarde'Ill Met by Moonlight' was based on the operation. Graham Stewart, the library curator who worked on the archive project, said: \"It is a history of the colourful life of a celebrated writer. He was undoubtedly a superstar of his day and his books have, if anything, grown in popularity over the years. \"There has already been a lot of interest in the archive and we expect this to increase now among Leigh Fermor fans and people interested in the 20th century more generally.\" The library is working on digitising some of the archive so it can be viewed on its website. They are also considering holding exhibitions and displays of the collection so more people will be able to see it. The archive was given to the library by the John R Murray Charitable Trust. John Murray was Sir Patrick's publisher and the trust also supported the cataloguing of the collection.",
        "St Michael's Hospital is joining other UK foetal medicine centres to set up a twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) registry to share information. Consultant Mark Denbow said they were \"constantly learning\" about TTTS. He said the \"rare and often devastating condition\" occurs in about 10-15 of identical twin pregnancies. St Michael's Hospital is also one of a few UK centres offering laser ablation surgery, where doctors can operate on the babies while they are in the womb. Jo and Finbarr O'Halloran, from Backwell, said they were \"devastated\" when they discovered their twins had the syndrome during a hospital scan. Mrs O'Halloran was given laser ablation surgery at about 22 weeks into the pregnancy in 2013. A few weeks later, daughters Eve and Amy were born by emergency caesarean section. Jo O'Halloran said: \"I am literally thankful every single day that they survived and that they're here.\" Keith Reed, from the Twins and Multiple Birth Association (Tamba), said they were \"still only skimming the surface\" in terms of data collection. He said: \"In order to build the best possible picture of TTTS cases in the UK, and help see which treatments offer the best possible outcomes, we need more hospitals with foetal medicine departments to sign up.\" TTTS affects twins who share a placenta, where the babies are not sharing blood equally. One baby gets too much blood and the other baby does not get enough. If left untreated 90 of these babies will die and even with treatment there is only up to 70 chance of both babies surviving.",
        "Researchers said measuring DNA sections in cancer cells gave an \"accurate indicator\" of disease progression. Shorter DNA structures can leave chromosome ends exposed, accelerating cancer progression and drug resistance. The team believe the study could help doctors in choosing the most effective treatment for individual patients. Researchers from the university's School of Medicine said the tests can be used to predict the outcomes of patients with two different types of blood cancer - the bone marrow cancer myeloma and pre-leukaemia myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The latter is a bone marrow disorder often leading to life-threatening bone marrow failure and even acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Results from two studies, which were funded by the charities Bloodwise and Cancer Research UK, have been published in the British Journal of Haematology. The researchers analysed samples from 134 myeloma patients, 80 MDS patients and 95 AML patients as part of the study. Prof Duncan Baird, who led the research, said: \"Our research provides strong evidence that shortening of telomeres [the DNA sections] plays a vital role in the progression of these blood cancers and that a significant number of patients should be receiving different levels of treatment. \"The next step is to assess telomere length in larger studies to establish how it can be integrated into existing assessments that predict patient outcome.\"",

During the debate, Labour's Owen Smith clashed with Plaid's Leanne Wood. Mr Smith challenged Plaid's Leanne Wood about whether she would vote down an Ed Miliband minority government. The Plaid leader responded by accusing Labour of taking Wales for granted over many decades. Also speaking to Sunday's BBC Wales programme, Mr Smith repeated his call to Ms Wood. \"Hell will freeze over before I vote with the Tories. Leanne Wood hasn't confirmed that she wouldn't vote with the Tories,\" he stated. \"She's the one that's got a question to answer about that not Labour.\" On behalf of Plaid Cymru, Dr Dafydd Trystan said his party's view was absolutely clear: \"We will not vote for a Tory prime minister neither will we vote for Tory policies imposed by a Labour Party.\" Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams told Sunday Politics Wales: \"The choices are either having a government that is dragged off by nationalists who will threaten jobs and threaten the stability of the union, or dragged off to the right by UKIP that would cut public expenditure or they could choose to vote for the Liberal Democrats who would anchor the government in the centre ground.\" UKIP's Nathan Gill told the programme: \"We really do believe that the people who make our laws are the people that are in Westminster or the Welsh Assembly, not in Brussels. \"We believe that the money that we spend needs to be spent here in Wales or Britain on us.\" Wales Green party leader Pippa Bartolotti said, \"We have a very real and immediate problem with the state of gender pay.

        "On Monday, the Supreme Court declared all the actions of the assembly null and void until they stood down. The three legislators say they agreed to leave the legislature to break the continuing stand-off. Without the seats, the opposition loses a critical two-thirds majority. The so-called \"super-majority\" would would allow the opposition to put a more effective challenge to the government of Nicolas Maduro. They would be able to change the constitution and appoint new Supreme Court judges. \"We completely reject that ruling,\" said the three legislators on a letter that was read in parliament. But their decision would \"help free parliament from the institutional ambush they want to lead it into,\" they added. The request by the three legislators - Julio Haron Ygarza, Nirma Guarulla and Romel Guzamana - was approved by the opposition-held assembly. Members of the pro-government bloc celebrated the decision as \"a victory for the people.\" \"We applaud this move, which puts the National Assembly back within the framework of legality,\" said pro-government legislator Hector Rodriguez. The newly-elected National Assembly had defied the Supreme Court ruling, swearing in the suspended legislators last week. Four lawmakers were barred by the Supreme Court - three from the opposition and one allied with the government - after the Socialist Party alleged irregularities during the 6 December vote for a new assembly. The opposition claimed the the ruling was designed to strip it of the crucial two-thirds majority. Without the four legislators, the opposition has 109 seats and the government 54. With the four banned legislators, the opposition gets the 112 seats it needs to reach the so-called \"super-majority.\" The four politicians are all from the rural and sparsely populated south-western state of Amazonas. Venezuela's Supreme Court has almost always ruled in favour of the government during the last 17 years of socialist government under President Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez.",

More reaction to the story David Eltringham, chief operating officer at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, said: \"We can assure our patients, staff and visitors that we remain vigilant in ensuring fire safety standards are maintained at all times.\" He said the trust \"learned of some potential issues with the infrastructure\" which prompted the internal investigation. The investigation found that \"in the unlikely event of a fire, the structures to prevent it spreading were not as robust as those specified in the original plan for the building,\" Mr Eltringham added. The trust says it collaborated with Skanska to identify remedial work and is working with the fire service to optimise fire safety standards. Meanwhile, steps are being taken to strengthen fire safety including additional patrols and increasing rubbish collections.

We'll make sure we learn the lessons from that and the inquiry in Shropshire.\" Mr Hughes, who is responsible for coroners, cremations and burials, said work on national regulations could begin before the election and be in place later in the year. The Shrewsbury independent inquiry, set up by Shropshire Council, is investigating cases at Emstrey Crematorium before 2012 and is due to report its findings next month. A BBC investigation found just one set of ashes had been returned to bereaved families since 2004. Co-operative Funeralcare, which took over the running of the site in 2011, said while it had returned infant remains in all cases since new equipment was introduced in 2012, it continued to follow industry guidance in advising families it could not \"fully guarantee ashes.\"",
        "Ball, who featured against Pakistan A in Dubai, has taken six wickets in each of Notts' first two games and is the leading wicket-taker in Division One of the County Championship so far in 2016. Read said of the 25-year-old: \"Last winter he got fitter and stronger. \"Now he's genuinely lively and he does plenty with the new ball.\" Read said Ball's assured early showings have demanded he lead Notts' bowling attack with the new ball alongside England's Stuart Broad. \"Jake is in fantastic form with the ball,\" continued Read. \"He's had a great winter having been in Dubai with the Lions and has had a taste of what life is like with the ECB set-up. He's really keen to progress that side of his career.\" Notts director of cricket Mick Newell said Ball, who was their second-highest County Championship wicket taker with 39 last season, said he has been \"terrific\" so far in 2016. \"That's a fantastic start to the season and he's setting a great example,\" added Newell. Despite Ball's efforts against Lancashire, Notts suffered an eight-wicket defeat in their second Country Championship match of the season on Wednesday, having beaten Surrey in their opening fixture.",
        "ScotRail said the Glasgow Queen Street Station tunnel would be closed from 20 March until 8 August. Services will divert to low-level platforms or Glasgow Central, bringing timetable changes and in some cases, longer journey times. The work is part of a PS60m upgrade project that will allow faster and longer trains to use the station. Passengers on ScotRail's main Edinburgh to Glasgow service, via Falkirk High, are being advised to travel via Bathgate and Airdrie. That journey will take around 70 minutes. Phil Verster, managing director of the ScotRail Alliance, said: \"Upgrading the tunnel will allow us to run faster, longer, greener trains in the future. \"This will mean more seats, shorter journey times and less impact on our environment. \"The long-term benefits of this investment will be considerable, not just for our railway, but also for the country.\" ScotRail said the closure was necessary to enable major engineering work to renew 1,800m of existing concrete slab track formation, which carries the rails through the 918m tunnel. The firm said this was the largest engineering project undertaken on the Edinburgh to Glasgow, via Falkirk High, railway, since it was built. The project will involve 140 days of continuous round-the-clock working, the removal of 10,000 tonnes of existing concrete slab and the installation of 4,000m of new rails. ScotRail has now launched a dedicated webpage to give passengers more information about the impact of the project. Transport Minister Derek Mackay said: \"This is a once in a generation project and one of the most ambitious ever planned on the Edinburgh-Glasgow route. \"The works will support the introduction of a new generation of faster, quieter and greener electric trains on routes across the Central Belt next year. \"Although I understand that this work will cause some inconvenience to passengers, the ScotRail Alliance is working to ensure that services are maintained where possible, disruption is kept to a minimum and that passengers are kept well informed throughout the work.\"",
        "The Fraser of Allander Institute reckons that growth this year will be 1.9, the same as its forecast for last year, for which official data has not been finalised. That is a reduction on the 2.2 forecast for 2016 that it published in November. For 2017, the forecast has fallen from 2.5 to 2.2 in those past four months. The economists at the Strathclyde University institute warned that growth was too dependent on household spending based on credit, which they said was unsustainable. They explained that the benefits of cheaper oil had not fed through to the economy as strongly as the harm it had done to the energy sector itself. The sustained low price was further pulling back on investment plans. The economists argued that this month's Westminster budget should avoid a further squeeze on spending, as tax revenues appeared to fall short of previous expectations. Prof Brian Ashcroft, author of the regular Fraser of Allander reports, said that would slow growth further and worsen the flow of tax revenues to the exchequer. The report said that job creation should continue but forecasted a slower rate of growth. The central forecast for net employment increase was 36,800, whereas in November, it was 45,000. The report also warned of the effect of the UK being taken out of the European Union, following the referendum in June. It claimed the uncertainty about the outcome of the vote would have a negative effect on investment. Its analysis of the European choice was that \"it is difficult to imagine that it would help improve Scotland's competitive position to our trade with the EU.\" It noted that the fall in electronics and other manufacturing exports had meant Scotland already found it hard to penetrate open EU markets. The Strathclyde report said Scottish exporters would find it more difficult if the trade arrangements were changed. Also, productivity could be slowed, when it was already relatively weak. The latest report from Fraser of Allander noted that the Scottish economy still benefited from low inflation and low interest rates and earning power had been increasing slowly. However, it reflected on the strength of Sterling, making imports cheaper and exports more difficult. That factor had weakened in recent weeks, though trade had been slowing globally. It said growth had been depending too much on rising and unsustainable household debt. Paul Brewer, a senior partner at PwC which sponsors the Fraser of Allander reports, said: \"The potential for the forthcoming budget to exert further fiscal tightening, oil price uncertainty and the uncertainty surrounding the potential outcome of the EU referendum, together create a difficult environment for business and investor confidence.\" He suggested the UK Chancellor could help the economy with a further cut in tax on oil producers. At sector level, the analysis said the service sector was the driver of growth, although financial services showed little sign of recovery to pre-recession levels. The production sector had contracted in the most recent official data, and construction had ceased to be the driver that it was of Scottish growth.",
        "They say that the new material is more robust and hardwearing than previous efforts to create artificial cartilage. A traditional ink-jet printer combined with a specialised spinning-machine is used to make it. It could lead to bespoke cartilage created for individual patients. But one expert warned it was too early to be confident it would ever be used. The study was published in the Institute of Physics' journal Biofabrication. It marks the latest effort to use 3D printers in medicine following the use of a machine to make a replacement lower jaw and efforts to create 3D-printed scaffolds to support the growth of bone cells. Scientists said they were able to build cartilage made from a chemical compound known as a polymer coated with cartilage cells from a rabbit's ear. They combined the ink-jet printer with a machine that uses an electric current to spin very fine fibres from the polymer solution. It allowed the construction to be easily controlled, meaning scientists could make the artificial cartilage porous. This is key to encouraging real cartilage cells to integrate into the surrounding tissue. So far the printed cartilage has been tested on mice and, after eight weeks, appeared to have developed the properties of real cartilage, suggesting it has potential for insertion into human patients. The scientists said that in the future it could allow medics to create cartilage specific to each patient's needs. They suggest an MRI scan could create a blueprint of a body part, such as a knee, and matching cartilage could be made using the 3D printer. \"This is a proof-of-concept study and illustrates that a combinations of materials and fabrication methods generates durable implantable constructs,\" said James Yoo, a professor at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and one of the paper's authors. At present one of the best options available to doctors treating cartilage damage is a technique called microfracture surgery. It involves drilling small holes into the bone in the cartilage's gap to encourage bleeding. Scar tissue then forms over the gap, acting as a replacement for the missing cartilage. But it is not generally suitable for older or more obese patients, and it does not work if the lesion is too large. Dr Richard Weiler - a consultant in sport and exercise medicine at University College London Hospitals - told the BBC the new innovation could potentially offer respite to a wider range of the patients he treated. But he had doubts about whether it would ever be used. \"Certainly with sport there are injuries that cause damage to cartilage - we have seen this with some famous footballers, cyclists and other athletes who have had traumatic injuries where the cartilage has been damaged and then drops off and doesn't grow back very well in the affected area,\" he said. \"However, there have been lots of previous cartilage replacement technologies that were shown to have had an effect in animals but have proved not to be as good as hoped when used long-term by humans. \"This technology sounds an interesting development, we would just want to make sure it's safe.\"",
        "The incidents, which occurred overnight between Sunday and Monday, took place in Granton, Boswall, Trinity and Hawthornvale. The cars targeted all had their windows smashed or had attempts made to smash them. About 25 incidents have been reported to police, however there may have been other vehicles damaged. Due to the number of incidents and the scale of the damage, officers are treating the incidents as linked and are appealing for witnesses to come forward. Insp Shane McKenna, of Drylaw Police Station, said: \"This is an appalling number of vandalisms and the sheer scale of the damage caused is completely unacceptable. \"Not only has a lot of damage and inconvenience been caused to a large number of people, it has also caused a number of police resources in the north of Edinburgh to be diverted in order to investigate. \"We are eager to trace those responsible as soon as possible.

        "Diana Sacayan, a well-known activist for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, was found dead in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. It is the third violent transgender death in the country in the past month. Latin America accounts for most transgender murders worldwide, rights groups say. Rights group Amnesty International said on Wednesday that the body of Ms Sacayan, discovered in her flat, showed signs of violence. \"A dark cloud has set over Argentina's trans community,\" said Mariela Belski, Executive Director of Amnesty International Argentina. \"Unless this latest wave of murders is effectively investigated and those responsible taken to justice, a message will be sent that attacking trans women is actually ok.\" President Fernandez echoed Amnesty's concerns. \"I ask the national security services and the metropolitan police to solve this horrible crime,\" she said during a public address. Ms Sacayan, 40, had been the leader of a number of organisations seeking equality for Argentina's LGBT community. In 2012 she was personally given her national identity card by President Fernandez, recognising her as a woman - a first for Argentina. Ms Sacayan's death followed the killings of Marcela Chocobar and Coty Olmos, two transgender women whose bodies were found over the last month in the provinces of Santa Fe and Santa Cruz. Latin America accounted for 78 of the 1,731 murders of transgender and gender-diverse people reported worldwide between January 2008 and December 2014, according to activist group Transgender Europe.",

        "Van Gaal, 65, has been out of work since being sacked by United hours after winning the FA Cup in May 2016. \"I thought maybe I would stop, then I thought it would be a sabbatical, but now I do not think I will return to coaching,\" Van Gaal was quoted as saying in Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. Van Gaal also had spells in charge of Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AZ. He made the announcement on Monday after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Dutch government for his contribution to football. He cited family issues for his decision, with De Telegraaf saying it was partly motivated by the sudden death of his daughter's husband last month. \"So much has happened in my family, you become a human being again with your nose pressed to the facts,\" he added. The Dutchman also revealed he turned down lucrative offers to continue his coaching career in the Far East. Media playback is not supported on this device Van Gaal played as a midfielder for Ajax, Royal Antwerp, Telstar, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ between 1972 and 1987 before moving into coaching, first as an assistant at AZ followed by the same role at Ajax. He replaced Leo Beenhakker as Ajax head coach in 1991 and went on to preside over a period of sustained success, winning the Dutch league title on three occasions as well as the 1992 Uefa Cup and the 1995 Champions League title. Van Gaal was asked to emulate that success at Spanish giants Barcelona. He inherited Bobby Robson's side in 1997 and led them to two successive La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey. His country came calling in 2000, but his first stint in charge lasted less than two years when Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, the first time they had missed the competition since 1986. The Dutchman's second spell at Barcelona was even shorter - eight months - as he left midway through the season with the club hovering just above the relegation zone. Media playback is not supported on this device He then guided AZ Alkmaar to the 2005-06 Eredivisie title before moving to the Bundesliga, where he helped Bayern Munich to the 2009-10 Bundesliga title. The Dutch national side approached Van Gaal again in 2012 and this time the Netherlands became one of the first two European countries, along with Italy, to qualify for Brazil 2014, where they finished in third place. After much speculation, he joined United in May 2014, signing a three-year contract to succeed David Moyes. However, United replaced him with Jose Mourinho after just two years following a fifth-placed Premier League finish in the 2015-16 season, with a first FA Cup triumph since 2004 not sufficient to save him.",
        "From a team that lays claim to being the first World Cup winner to a side featuring Chris Waddle's son, the qualifying rounds are full of interesting stories. The long journey to the FA Cup final begins on Friday, with 368 teams competing in the extra preliminary round. BBC Sport takes a look at some of the more intriguing stories surrounding those qualifying games. With a long history and a famous tradition, the FA Cup is widely regarded as the most prestigious domestic cup competition in the world. West Auckland Town have reached the first round proper of the competition on three previous occasions, but supporters speak most fondly about their biggest claim to fame - being the first winners of the World Cup. The team from the small County Durham village were invited to participate in the inaugural Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy in 1909. It was one of the first international tournaments in world football and, consequently, was considered by some as the first World Cup. West Auckland Town won the tournament, and repeated that feat two years later, beating Juventus 6-1. \"There was nothing about it in the English press at the time, but it was massive news in Italy and all over the newspapers,\" says the club's general manager Stuart Alderson. \"We got to keep the trophy and we had it on display until 1994, when it was stolen. We have a replica now, and people still come from all over the world to see it.\" West Auckland begin their pursuit of FA Cup glory at Lancashire-based side Nelson, a team which also boasts a proud history, having been the first English side to beat Real Madrid in Spain. They were a league side during the 1920s, rising to the old Second Division - now the Championship - in 1923, beating the likes of Leeds and Manchester United. In preparation for their first campaign at that level, they opted for a pre-season tour of Spain, where they beat Real Oviedo 2-1 and Real Madrid 4-2. \"Everybody is well aware of the team's history in Nelson,\" manager Mark Fell said. \"The story of beating Real Madrid has been passed from generation to generation. \"This club has a rich history and it is our job to make this generation proud of their team.\" When the teams are read out for Staveley Miners Welfare's tie against Worksop Town on Friday night, there could be a very familiar name among them. Jack Waddle, the 20-year-old son of former England winger Chris, recently signed for Worksop, the side his father played for 15 years ago. \"Jack is very much following in his father's footsteps,\" Worksop secretary Paul Stacey said. \"He missed our first two games through injury, however I believe he is in the squad for the FA Cup game.\" Chris Waddle played in two FA Cup finals at Wembley - losing one with Spurs in 1987 and another with Sheffield Wednesday in 1993. With a World Cup winner and the son of an England winger involved, there is already an international feel to the FA Cup, but that is heightened by the inclusion of FC Romania. It is not the country, of course, but a team named after it. Formed by Romanian Ion Vintila and his friends eight years ago, Hertfordshire-based FC Romania have progressed a great deal since playing their first competitive fixture against a team called Beating Chastards. They shot up seven leagues in eight seasons, turned semi-professional this year and have even had a former international footballer on their books. Claudiu Raducanu, capped twice by Romania, previously played for Espanyol in Spain and Romanian side Steaua Bucharest, for whom he scored against Southampton in the 2004-05 Uefa Cup. He left in the summer but Vintila has not ruled out the possibility of him returning. The prospect of an FA Cup appearance may prove a tempting proposition. \"The FA Cup is the oldest competition in football, and it was always our goal to play in it,\" says Vintila. \"We usually get around 80 to 100 people at games, but hopefully 500 will come down for this game.\" FC Romania, making their FA Cup debut, play Haverhill Rovers in the extra preliminary round this weekend. As a child, James Phillips used to dream of guiding a non-league side to FA Cup glory as he played Championship Manager on his computer. On Saturday, the 22-year-old Romsey Town boss will not only get to live out his dream, but he'll also be making history as the youngest manager in the competition's history. \"I was one of those sad people after school who was sat there for hours playing Championship Manager,\" Phillips told BBC Sport. \"I always used to try to take a really small club up through the leagues. From a really young age that got my interest going. Now I'm doing it in real life.\" Perhaps winning the award for the most unusual name, and statistic, is Billingham Synthonia - the only team in England named after an agricultural fertiliser. The Synners most famous player is Brian Clough. The former Derby County and Nottingham Forest manager made four appearances for them, scoring three goals in the 1952-53 season before he went on national service. On Saturday, the team named after fertiliser host Durham City. It could make for an interesting tie if they progress and are drawn against West Allotment Celtic in the preliminary round... Never mind dreaming of a Wembley final appearance, the players at one club have their eye on another prize for doing well in the FA Cup - PS15 kit bags. Sporting Khalsa host Pegasus Juniors and, if they win to progress to the preliminary round, a bag sporting the club's emblem is all theirs. \"That's the joys of the FA Cup at grassroots level,\" Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe told the FA. \"The pros are fortunate enough to get to the quarter finals, semi-final and final - we are just looking to win one game so I can splash the cash and buy the lads a PS15 bag each.\" Ellesmere Rangers have been involved in the FA Cup every year since 2008-09, but they got into this season's edition by the skin of their teeth. The Shropshire-based team compete in the West Midlands League Premier Division - the 10th level of English football - and qualified under the FA's points per game system, which rewards those clubs who miss out on automatic qualification with a place in the competition based on their form across the previous season. Ellesmere qualified in the final slot, effectively making them entry number 736 - the last team in the hat. \"We finished 11th last season so we didn't expect to get in this year,\" says club secretary John Edge. \"It really is a big boost for the club because the prize money can help you through a whole season.\" On 30 May, 2015, the FA Cup trophy will stand on a pedestal at a packed Wembley, but its journey begins in more humble surroundings. The trophy will travel to Gloucestershire on Saturday, to the town of Fairford, whose team begin their FA Cup journey with a home tie against Knaphill. \"It is a huge day for the club,\" said committee member Chris Tanner. \"Everyone at Fairford is looking forward to the game and to have the FA Cup coming to town is quite special. \"The FA Cup generates tremendous interest for clubs both in the professional game and non-league and Saturday will be no different. \"Perhaps some won't have realised the FA Cup starts in August.\" The Football Association has quite a job on its hands to make sure all extra preliminary round results are accurate, and that teams do not field ineligible players. In previous years, the home club would report results by voicemail message, which would then have to be decoded by the FA and Press Association before the result could be confirmed and later published. These days the system is set up to be more efficient. The FA sends out an automated text message to each club 15 minutes after kick-off, which explains how the result needs to be reported by text simply by replying to the message. The result and attendance is then published automatically on receipt by The FA of the incoming text message. In order to avoid clubs fielding ineligible players, both teams are required to complete an official team sheet, which is then inspected by a match official, prior to a tie taking place. The above are just a few of the unique tales to come from this year's FA Cup, but we want to hear your FA Cup story. Do you have an interesting tale to tell about your team's exploits and do you have any pictures that best sum up the magic of the cup?

        "It means bloggers with more than 3,000 daily readers must register with the mass media regulator, Roskomnadzor, and conform to the regulations that govern the country's larger media outlets. Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move \"draconian.\" The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law \"another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression.\" \"The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,\" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new \"information security law\" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to \"cheat\" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's \"internet guru,\" wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. \"The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person,\" Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing \"CIA project.\" He also claimed that the popular Russian search engine Yandex was controlled by foreign intelligence. Two years ago, Russia enacted a law enabling authorities to blacklist and force certain websites offline without a trial. The government said the legislation was designed to protect children from harmful internet content, such as pro-suicide or pornography websites. On Thursday, lawyers for US intelligence officer Edward Snowden said the whistleblower had filed for refugee status in Russia. Mr Snowden received temporary shelter in Russia last year. He had evaded US authorities after he leaked classified government documents revealing mass surveillance programmes undertaken by the NSA in the US and GCHQ in the UK.",
        "Scientists found that even the lowest expected levels of warming could decimate populations. However the researchers found that restoring connections between butterfly habitats could help modify the worst impacts. The research has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Although many people believe that butterflies are creatures that love the warmth, periods of extremely hot and dry weather can significantly reduce populations. In this study, British researchers looked at the impact of an extreme drought event in 1995 on butterfly species. This was the most arid summer since records began in 1776. They identified six species, including the Cabbage White and the Speckled Wood butterflies, that were particularly sensitive to heat. They then looked at what might happen to these creatures under different levels of warming up to 2100. If emissions of carbon dioxide continue on a \"business as usual\" model, and warming is more extreme, then extinctions of some of these species could begin in England as early as 2050. \"We looked at the extent to which populations crashed from the drought and how long it takes them to recover,\" said lead author Dr Tom Oliver from Nerc Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. \"What we're asking is, as droughts become more frequent whether the return time of the drought was more frequent than the recovery of the butterflies.\" \"And when that was the case you'd get this gradual population erosion and in those places you'd get local extinctions.\" The researchers say that areas of the south east of England would be worst affected. However they argue that under less extreme warming conditions, changes to butterfly habitats could ameliorate the worst impacts. The team found that restoring connections between habitats that have been fragmented by human activities such as agriculture, was capable of making a big difference. Under a low emissions scenario, bridging these connections could improve the probability of butterfly survival by 50. \"If our habitats are very fragmented, the impacts will be much more severe. In places where it isn't those populations might persist,\" said Dr Oliver. \"It allows us to buy time until we get those global emission cuts in place.\" The researchers believe their study is a conservative estimation of how warming might impact these fragile species. They are concerned that, because of landscape changes in the UK throughout the 20th century, populations of some of the threatened species might be too low for them to recover from frequent droughts. The authors say that even people who are not impressed by the aesthetic appeal of butterflies should still be concerned about their demise. \"Butterflies are important culturally as part of our natural heritage, but there are other functions that could be impacted by their extinction including pollution, pest control and decomposition of waste,\" said Dr Oliver. \"Those un-swayed by the beauty and importance of having butterflies in the countryside ought to be concerned about the disruption to these functions provided by these species.\" Follow Matt on Twitter mattmcgrathbbc.",
        "India were cruising to their target of 349 - and the highest successful run-chase in Australia - as both Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli made hundreds. But India collapsed from 277-1 to 323 all out as Australia pace bowler Kane Richardson took 5-68. Aaron Finch made 107 and David Warner 93 in Australia's 348-8. The home side had already sealed the five-match series and now lead 4-0, targeting a whitewash in Saturday's final match in Sydney. The World Cup holders have also now won 18 consecutive ODIs on home soil. That run was in severe peril at the Manuka Oval as Kohli and Dhawan added 212 for the second wicket, with Kohli, 27, compiling a 25th one-day hundred to go joint-fourth on the all-time list. But after Dhawan cut John Hastings to point, India imploded. Captain MS Dhoni edged Hastings behind for a second-ball duck and, when Kohli lobbed Richardson to mid-off, India had lost three wickets for one run. Of the rest, only Ravi Jadeja made double figures, with Richardson and Mitchell Marsh running through the tail.",
        "Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 52 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 31. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as \"What Happened, If It Happened.\" Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist. Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. \"It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,\" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. \"The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). \"John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. \"It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called'readable' books.\" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize.

        "The pictures show the swirling clouds of the gas giant at both its poles - views that no previous mission has managed to acquire in such detail. Juno captured the data last weekend as it made its first close approach to the planet since going into orbit in July. The flyby took the spacecraft just 4,200km above Jupiter's multi-coloured atmosphere. The 6MB of data downlinked to Earth from the encounter is still being analysed, but principal investigator Scott Bolton said new things were already obvious. \"First glimpse of Jupiter's north pole, and it looks like nothing we have seen or imagined before. It's bluer in colour up there than other parts of the planet, and there are a lot of storms,\" the Southwest Research Institute scientist explained in a Nasa statement. \"There is no sign of the latitudinal bands or zones and belts that we are used to - this image is hardly recognisable as Jupiter. \"We're seeing signs that the clouds have shadows, possibly indicating that the clouds are at a higher altitude than other features.\" Jonathan Nichols from the University of Leicester, UK, is a member of the Juno mission's science team. He told the BBC that his colleagues were bowled over when they first saw the pictures: \"The team's reaction was amazement.'Look at these images; they are coming from Jupiter; we're flying over the pole for the first time!' It's just jaw-dropping.\" When the Juno probe arrived at Jupiter in July, its instruments and camera were switched off. It had to perform a critical rocket manoeuvre to get into orbit - and engineers did not want the complication of taking pretty pictures at the same time. But after successfully turning around the planet, Juno booted up its other systems, and last Saturday's return pass was the first opportunity to get a good look at the gaseous world. The probe's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) has acquired unique views of Jupiter's southern aurora. Earth telescopes have tried but failed to get such images. And Juno's RadioPlasma Wave Experiment (Waves) has recorded the blizzard of particles moving through the planet's super-strong magnetic field. Juno's quest is to investigate the secrets of the Solar System by explaining the origin and evolution of its biggest planet. The spacecraft's remote sensing instruments will look down into the giant's many layers and measure their composition, temperature, motion and other properties. We should finally discover whether Jupiter has a solid core or if its gas merely compresses to an ever denser state all the way to the centre. We will also get new information on the famous Great Red Spot - the colossal storm that has raged on Jupiter for hundreds of years. Juno will tell us how deep its roots go. And Dr Nichols said Jupiter was a wonderful laboratory to try to understand even more distant places. \"We can go to Jupiter and kick the tyres to see how it works, but that then gives us some insights on lots of other objects in the Universe. \"We can use Jupiter as an analogue for things like brown dwarfs and exoplanets - basically, any fast-rotating body with a magnetic field can be modelled in some way like Jupiter.\" The spacecraft is currently flying on an ellipse around Jupiter that takes 53 days to complete. Its next close approach is due on 19 October, when the probe will fire its main engine to tighten the circuit to just 14 days. This configuration will then be held until February 2018 when the spacecraft will be commanded to make a destructive dive into Jupiter's atmosphere. By that stage, however, scientists hope to have built a formidable data-set to help answer their most pressing questions about this vast world. and follow me on Twitter: BBCAmos",
        "But those words - contained in a detailed statement issued by Scotland Yard on Monday afternoon - raise more questions than answers. Will police continue to dedicate resources to non-recent allegations of abuse? Has their approach to such cases changed? And what's the impact on the Metropolitan Police and its Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe? In terms of Sir Bernard, his immediate future is secure - despite calls from Harvey Proctor and others for him to resign. In February, the commissioner was granted a one-year extension to his five-year contract, which will make him the longest-serving Met chief since Sir Paul Condon, who was at the helm from 1993 to 2000. The contract decision was taken by Theresa May, the Home Secretary, who took advice from London's Mayor, Boris Johnson. It was a reflection of the 58-year-old Yorkshireman's wider record at the Met, tackling crime and terrorism, making budget savings and rebuilding trust in the force after allegations that police officers passed confidential information to journalists and failed properly to investigate phone hacking. However, Operation Midland has undoubtedly tested the commissioner's leadership and judgement. A detective's ill-judged comment that the complainant's allegations were \"credible and true\" stoked criticism of the inquiry. Established in November 2014, Operation Midland was set up to examine historical claims of a Westminster VIP paedophile ring, with allegations that boys were abused by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies. The inquiry was also intended to examine claims that three boys were murdered during the alleged ring's activities. Operation Midland related to locations across southern England and in London in the 1970s and 1980s, and focused on the private Dolphin Square estate in Pimlico, south-west London. Historical child abuse: Key investigations In February, Sir Bernard responded by announcing a judge-led review of abuse investigations and calling for a new approach so officers don't \"unconditionally\" believe what victims say. That sparked a war of words with Sir Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, who said that unless police initially believed allegations they wouldn't record them properly and therefore wouldn't investigate them. Amid concern that if police rowed back from \"believing\" victims it would deter them from coming forward, the College of Policing has now clarified the issue, writing to chief constables and police and crime commissioners about the need to \"further improve\" the confidence of victims to report allegations. In the confusing aftermath of Operation Midland, the College of Policing letter shows police the way ahead: believe the account given by a victim unless there's credible evidence that no crime has been committed, then carry out a thorough investigation to prove or disprove the allegations. There's nothing new about the guidance - it's there already in police, Crown Prosecution Service and Home Office manuals - but it clearly needed restating. The more urgent question now is how police cope with the tide of sexual abuse allegations that shows no sign of receding. Between 2006 and 2012 the number of sexual offences recorded by police in England and Wales was steady, at around 50,000 to 55,000. But that autumn, the revelations about Jimmy Savile, together with appeals to victims to come forward, emboldened other survivors of abuse to report what had happened and the numbers have increased every year since. According to the latest data, for the 12 months ending in September 2015, there were a record 99,609 sexual offences reported to and logged by police, although some of the rise is due to improvements forces have made in the way they process allegations. However, there's no sign that the increase is slowing. Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the national policing lead on child protection and abuse investigation, believes this is partly due to a genuine rise in cases, facilitated by the internet, rather than simply a greater willingness of victims to come forward. He told The Times police could be investigating 200,000 cases of child sexual abuse by 2020 if the numbers continue to go up at the present rate. With police budgets remaining stretched, forces will have to make difficult decisions about where to spend resources. Victims who are at risk now and suspects who are at large now will be the priority. Historical cases, however awful the alleged abuse, however powerful the alleged abusers, may have to wait their turn.",
        "Homes have been added to My NHS, part the NHS Choices site, allowing users to leave ratings and reviews to help other people assess services. Each care home is scored on its level of safety, staff turnover and food hygiene, among other standards. The National Care Association said if information was not up to date, it could be \"unfair\" to care providers. On the website, a database can be searched using a postcode, region or home name to check on facilities with or without nursing. People can access: Health Minister Alistair Burt said: \"We know how difficult important decisions about care for a loved one can be - this is a victory for those who are worried about care - with a click of a button the public will be able to make an informed choice about care and make those difficult decisions easier. \"This data will show clearly the difference in quality across care homes and will help drive up standards by highlighting poor performers which will mean they have to shape up their services or lose out.\" Nadra Ahmed, chair of the National Care Association, which represents independent care sector providers, said the move could help people \"answer some of the questions\" they may have about care. But she warned that if the \"snapshot\" of the provider's rating or profile on the site was not regularly updated it could disadvantage those who improve their service. \"I don't know how [improvements] would be indicated.... especially if that report is not going to be reviewed for a period of time, which would be unfair.\" She added: \"Nothing beats actually going to see a service for yourself. If you think that it's good [but the website] says there's something that's not quite right, don't let it put you off. \"When you look at the website you know that responsible services who may have an inadequate rating will be working towards making that better.\"",

Chinese shares saw the biggest falls in the region with the Shanghai Composite closing down 2.8 at 4,112.21 - marking a third day of declines. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.3 at 27,289.97 - falling for the sixth day. Several companies on the mainland have announced share offerings through the week, leading investors to pull funds from other stocks. Investors were also worried about reported new moves by regulators to cool China's market, such as capping the size of margin financing and limiting the type of stocks investors can buy with borrowed money. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 1.23 at 19,291.99 after being closed all week for a holiday. Australia's benchmark SPASX 200 index closed down 0.82 at 5,645.70. Shares in Australia had suffered their biggest one-day fall in more than two years on Wednesday following disappointing results from Australia's biggest banks. Investors are concerned about the country's big four banks facing slower growth. National Australia Bank (NAB), the last of the big banks to announce their results this week, reported a 5.4 rise in cash profit for the six months to March. It also announced a 5.5bn Australian dollar (4.4bn; PS2.8bn) capital-raising exercise which will involve the selling of new shares. NAB wants to demerge and float its troubled British bank, Clydesdale, and shore up its balance sheet. The lender's capital-raising announcement has been reported by some of Australia's media as being the largest in the country's corporate history. Also weighing on investor confidence were the latest figures on Australia's unemployment rate, which showed a slight rise to 6.2 in April.

        "It says this affects the majority of UK youngsters who do not take A-levels (Highers in Scotland) or degrees. The report says youngsters are let down by an over-emphasis on higher education and lack of training options. The Department for Education said it was investing in apprenticeships in England. The report's findings were supported by Malcolm Trobe, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. \"The intense academic focus of the existing curriculum is too narrow for some students and a new approach is needed.\" The Lords report argues that while there is so much focus on the numbers entering university, the majority of young people in the UK do not opt for academic study after the age of 16. \"In England, in 2013-14, of a total population of 1,285,800 16 and 17-year-olds, only 47 (601,500 people) started A-levels, whereas 53 (684,300) did not do so,\" the report says. The Lords research finds that for those who do not follow an academic route, the system is \"complex and incoherent.\" \"Careers advice and education are being delivered in a way which means that too many young people simply drift into further studies or their first job, which often has no real prospect of progression.\" The report says league tables encourage schools to focus on academic results and this \"can dishearten young people\" who are middle-ability achievers and can limit social mobility. While recognising the value of apprenticeships, the committee says they are only taken by 6 of 16 to 18 year olds. Among those beginning apprenticeships in 2014-15, 77 were over 19 and 42 over 25. The Lords report also notes that government policy has protected schools and university funding, but not the budgets of post-16 colleges which serve the majority of youngsters who do not go on to university. It finds an inequality in investment, with a university student receiving about PS6,000 more per year of public funding than a young person attending college. It criticises a \"confused\" qualifications system that has been subjected to continual change and does not guarantee quality employment. \"The qualifications themselves are often poorly understood by employers. Employers cannot be expected to understand what skills unfamiliar qualifications represent and cannot be expected to have knowledge and faith in their quality.\" The report says: \"There is a culture of inequality between vocational and academic routes to work. The culture pervades the system and the incentives to everyone involved.\" The report cites Switzerland and Germany as countries which operate successful and respected systems of both vocational and academic pathways into employment. The Lords' recommendations include: \"The message was'do your A-levels, then progress on to university', as though that was the only route!\" \"I left three months before the end of my A-levels due to stress, pressure and anxiety.... I was not prepared for any other options - I did not know about apprenticeships.\" \"I had always been told that I had to do A-levels and then go to university. I decided that that wasn't what I wanted to do, but had no idea what to do when I left school.\" Committee chairman Baroness Corston said the current system for helping people move from school to work was failing most young people, limiting their opportunity for social mobility. \"To focus on university or apprenticeships, to the exclusion of other routes, is to the detriment of many talented and able young people,\" she said. \"A young person considering their options for further education or employment is presented with gobbledygook - it is totally unclear to them how they can get the skills needed for a successful career.\" The report was welcomed by Alice Barnard, chief executive of the Edge Foundation, which campaigns to raise the status of vocational education. \"The Social Mobility Committee is absolutely right. The inequality between academic and vocational education is unfair, restricts social mobility and does not meet the UK's economic needs.\" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We have introduced a more rigorous curriculum so every child learns the basic skills they need such as English and maths so they can go on to fulfil their potential whether they are going into the world of work or continuing their studies. \"We will invest PS70m in our careers strategy over the course of this parliament to transform the quality of careers education.\" The Scottish Government says it is taking forward a range of actions aimed at reducing youth employment by 40 by 2021. This includes bringing schools, college and employers closer together to open up work opportunities to everyone, whatever their background or gender.",
        "Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital \"trampled all human values.\" \"In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,\" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker \"wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors.\" One employee wrote on Facebook: \"Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us.\" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to \"avenge the blood of our people.\" IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.",
        "Bent rescued a point for the Rams against Sheffield Wednesday, heading in the equaliser a minute after coming off the bench on Saturday. Derby, already assured of a play-off spot, are unbeaten in five games. \"The main thing is that we go into the play-offs full of confidence and not losing games,\" Bent said. Former England striker Bent said falling at the first hurdle of the play-offs against West Ham in his last season with Ipswich Town in 2004-05 was a harsh early lesson in his career. \"A fair few years ago now at Ipswich, our season had gone because we only managed to win one out of our last five games. We went into the play-offs with no real confidence,\" Bent told BBC Radio Derby. As for his own personal form, Bent was pleased to make an impact as a substitute having not featured since Derby's 3-3 draw with Rotherham in March. The goal was the former Aston Villa, Sunderland and Charlton forward's first since netting the winner in Derby's 2-1 FA Cup third-round win against League Two side Hartlepool in January and only his second in the Championship this season. Bent scored 12 goals in 17 games during a loan spell at the iPro Stadium from Villa last season, before signing a full-time deal last summer. \"The boys have been joking it was my first touch in three months, it was nice,\" Bent said. \"It was a while for that one to come. It's been difficult to get minutes on the pitch with the team playing really well, Chris Martin at the top of his game and the two wide men playing well. \"To be match sharp is impossible if you play a few minutes every four or five weeks, but when you do get on the pitch you want to help the team out, and it worked.\"",
        "The party has been carrying out \"one final round\" of vetting to determine who is eligible to stand in the race. UKIP donor Arron Banks suggested Steven Woolfe will not be on the ballot. Mr Woolfe's candidacy is in officials' hands after he missed the deadline and revealed he did not disclose a drink-driving ban when he stood to be a police commissioner in 2012. Also in the race are MEPs Jonathan Arnott and Bill Etheridge, while Huntingdonshire councillor Lisa Duffy and activists Phillip Broughton and Elizabeth Jones have also put their names forward. There is continued uncertainty about whether prominent MEP Diane James has applied. The contest has been sparked by Mr Farage's decision to stand down following the UK's vote to leave the EU, saying his \"political ambition has been achieved.\" The vetting panel had been expected to announce on Tuesday which candidates were eligible to stand under the party's rules after nominations closed on Sunday. But after the panel met it issued a statement saying the final list of leadership candidates would be revealed on Wednesday at midday. \"An NEC-led panel has today met to determine the eligibility of those candidates that submitted their nomination papers to stand for party leader. \"That panel has now met and with one final round of checking to go the party aims to announce the full list of candidates at midday tomorrow, Wednesday 3 August,\" a party spokesman said. To qualify, candidates are expected to have been party members for two years and to have been nominated by 50 members of the party. UKIP leadership: Runners and riders Steve Crowther, who left his job as UKIP chairman earlier this week, would not be drawn on whether Mr Woolfe - seen as the frontrunner in the race - should be excluded from the contest for submitting his papers 15 minutes late - a delay that the MEP has blamed on computer problems. But asked about the issue of the drink-driving conviction - which Mr Woolfe incurred in 2002 but which he did not reveal when he stood to become a police and crime commissioner in 2012 in a possible breach of electoral law - he told the BBC that this was \"arguably more serious.\" Mr Woolfe got a PS350 fine and nine-month ban for being drunk in charge of a scooter but insisted his life had moved on by 2012 and the conviction was spent by then. Amid reports of a power struggle within the party, UKIP NEC member Victoria Ayling tweeted on Tuesday evening to urge her fellow panel members not to \"block\" Mr Woolfe. UKIP donor Arron Banks later tweeted: \"Tonight's decision to exclude Woolfe is the final straw\" and he claimed it represented a \"coup\" by UKIP MP Douglas Carswell and Neil Hamilton, UKIP's leader in the Welsh Assembly. Mr Hamilton - who is backing MEP Mr Arnott for the role - has said Mr Woolfe should not be able to run for the party's leadership if his nomination was submitted late. Meanwhile, Mr Carswell, the party's only MP, has said he will not be endorsing any of the candidates but suggested they needed to consider what UKIP's purpose was after the EU referendum, how it should go about increasing its elected representation and how the party's leadership style needed to change.",

        "Ian Brown, 44, and Daniel Dunkley, 35, took their own lives at HMP Woodhill last July. Their relatives claimed Woodhill's governor had not complied fully with Prison Service Instructions (PSIs). The governor and Justice Secretary Liz Truss said the judicial review claim was \"neither appropriate or necessary.\" PSIs cover management of prisoners at risk of harm to themselves, to others and from others, early days in custody and medical emergency response codes. Heather Williams QC, for the families, said the claim addressed what she said was an \"exceptionally high\" rate of self-inflicted deaths at the Milton Keynes prison. Seven prisoners killed themselves last year, five in 2015, with 18 in total since May 2013. Ms Williams said the case raised serious ongoing breaches of Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, which protects the right to life, and involved long-term failures to comply with the responsibility placed on the authorities to protect prisoners. James Strachan QC, defending, said: \"Not only have the governor and the secretary of state taken significant action in 2016 to improve the situation, but this is a continuing high priority.\" Lord Justice Irwin and Mr Justice Garnham rejected the judicial review claim. In their ruling, they said the families had failed to establish a \"systemic failing.\" Mr Justice Garnham said: \"The defendants have made it clear that they share the great concern of the claimants about the rate of suicides in prisons generally, and HMP Woodhill in particular. \"They have in place sensible and satisfactory policies. \"The defendants have acknowledged that, on occasions, operational errors have been made by their staff in dealing with those at risk of suicide and have sought to prevent those mistakes being repeated.\"",

In the period, Boeing made 748 commercial aircraft deliveries, down from 762 in 2015, claiming to have led the market for \"the fifth consecutive year.\" It also delivered fewer military planes - in particular, its new CH-47 Chinook helicopter and its FA-18 fighter jet - while sales in the division slipped 7. Revenue also fell in the firm's space and services divisions because of weaker demand for satellites and aircraft modernisation. However, overall group earnings surged 59 in the fourth quarter of the year as demand for the company's commercial planes ticked up. Boeing also projected higher commercial deliveries this year of between 760 and 765 aircraft. The company's shares were up by more than 2 in early trading in New York.",

        "\"The gritters are now travelling to various workshops for maintenance, just like getting a car serviced,\" said a highways official. The \"low-risk\" season begins in October with \"high-risk\" starting in November. The county council said they had to think about the upcoming winter even when it was \"boiling hot.\" The fleet of more than 40 vehicles covers about 1,865 miles (3,000km) of roads including all major traffic routes and selected A and B roads. Officials said the service was stood down in April but had to start again surprisingly soon. Richard Fenwick, from county council highways, said: \"The end of summer is a busy time, even when it is boiling hot we have to think about it. \"We have drivers go out during the day to make sure they know the routes, iron out any wrinkles.\" The authority said it had about 35,000 tonnes of salt in stock and would expect to use about 25,000 tonnes in an average year.",
        "Iwan Wyn Lewis of Penygroes, Gwynedd, had been sectioned at Ysbyty Gwynedd after allegedly assaulting his mother. The 36-year-old was visited by an officer in April 2016 about his bail arrangements, which a doctor said could have added to his distress. His body was found in the Menai Strait on 2 May. Mr Lewis was receiving treatment at the hospital's Hergest unit and was later moved to the Cynan ward where he received the visit from the officer. Speaking at the inquest in Caernarfon on Thursday, consultant psychiatrist Dr Olufemi Adebajo said he was \"extremely unhappy\" about the visit. \"I don't think the police should be able to come to the ward without special permission,\" he said. Asked by coroner Nicola Jones whether the conversation with the officer could have added to Mr Lewis' agitation and distress, Dr Adebajo said: \"It's quite possible - even likely.\" He said he had known Mr Lewis for more than two years and never considered him to be a suicide risk. The day before his death, he had asked staff for extra medication because he said he was feeling agitated, but they did not change his dosage because they could see no sign of agitation. On the evening of 2 May, Mr Lewis told staff he was going to the shop, but 45 minutes later his body was found in the Menai Strait. The inquest continues.",

        "The Lions, who won the semi-final first leg 3-1, looked to have put the tie to bed when Lee Gregory slotted home. But Jamie Proctor's strike just before half-time, after Jordan Archer blocked his first effort, gave City hope. Proctor then wasted a further chance moments later, and it proved costly as Millwall held on to set up a showdown with Barnsley on 29 May. Neil Harris' side were rarely troubled after Proctor twice turned down the opportunity to shoot when excellently placed - and, if anything, they looked the more likely to score again after the break. Centre-half Byron Webster came closest, sending a header narrowly wide of Ben Williams' post, as the second leg petered out in front of a raucous crowd at The Den. Millwall's success against Bradford means that, across this season's Football League play-offs, all five teams who won the first leg of their semi-final went on to reach Wembley. The majority of the damage was done even before half-time at Valley Parade, where goals from Gregory, Steve Morison and Joe Martin had put the Lions in full command against Bradford. The Bantams have twice previously come back from a first-leg deficit to progress to the final and win promotion, but Gregory's calm, side-footed finish ensured there would be no repeat in south-east London. Millwall must now beat Barnsley, who thumped Walsall 6-1 over two legs in the other semi-final, if they are to secure an instant return to the Championship. Millwall manager Neil Harris: \"I'm delighted for the players, They deserved it over the two legs. \"We really had to battle, both tonight and last Sunday. It was tough but we've earned our place at Wembley. \"Barnsley will be really tough opponents.

        "Benchmark Brent crude hit 50.22 per barrel at one stage on Thursday, its highest level since early November. The rise followed US data showing that oil inventories had fallen after supply disruptions due to fires in Canada. Brent crude has now risen 80 since it hit 13-year lows of below 28 a barrel at the start of the year. US crude oil inventories fell by 4.2 million barrels to 537.1 million barrels in the week to May 20, according to US Department of Energy data. Canada is the biggest supplier to the US and wildfires in the western provinces have reduced supplies by about a million barrels per day. Talks in recent months between Opec and Russia about freezing oil production had already encouraged a price rise. Short-term disruptions to oil supplies have also lifted the price, offsetting higher production from Iran and Saudi Arabia. As well as the disruption to key oil production facilities in Canada, attacks by militant groups continue to restrict oil pipelines in Nigeria. Demand has also been better than expected from major economies such as China, India and Russia. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \"We do now appear to be seeing the effects that the decline in US output is having, and while supplies remain elevated, the glut does now appear to be diminishing.\" Against this backdrop, analysts are starting to raise their forecasts. Goldman Sachs said earlier this month that it now expected oil prices to consistently hit 50 a barrel in the second half of 2016 and 60 by the end of 2017. The US bank said: \"The oil market continues to deliver its share of surprises, with low prices driving disruptions in Nigeria, higher output in Iran and better demand. \"With each of these shifts significant in magnitude, the oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected.\" In a sign of growing confidence, oil companies have started preparing for higher prices. BP said last month it had budgeted for prices of at least between 50 and 55 a barrel in 2017. And last month US oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources announced plans to add up to 10 new rigs when the oil price gets back up to 50. Adam Laird, an investment manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, told the BBC: \"This is an area that's been starved of resources and investment and that psychological barrier [of 50] could be enough to make some executives reassess.\" However, Mr Laird cautioned that price volatility was likely to continue. \"It's too early to say this is the beginning of the big rebound,\" he said. Abhishek Deshpande, an oil markets analyst at Natixis, agreed and said: \"We believe that the market is going up, but if it goes too quickly there will be auto-corrections.\"",

        "Some argue that Africans have never had so much artistic freedom, with a proliferation of books, paintings and films since the advent of multi-party democracy in the 1990s, and the huge advance in technology which has allowed anyone with a smartphone to publish their views across the world. But critics say artists are still subject to tight censorship, pointing out that a South African gallery was forced to remove a painting of President Jacob Zuma under political pressure, while in Uganda a play about gay rights was banned. So, just how free are Africa's artists - in film, literature and music- to tell their own stories? Here are some of their experiences: Having been born and raised in Uganda, it was the best place to be. It was my home and my everything. I remember joining the film industry in 1999 - everything was still good. You didn't need a licence to shoot a film, no censor body to look at your script. All you had to do was get a camera, run to the streets, shoot something and lock yourself in the edit suite - and later put your work out there for the world to see. Today, I have grown to understand that not all stories can be told and not just any film can be done here. There are topics you have to think twice before tackling or which, for your safety, are better left untold. Topics that will get even actors saying: \"I think I am not the right person for that role\" even when you know they can pull it off. Here, you don't just wake up to say you are doing a film about the gay community, a film about the political situation, or a film that paints a bad picture of Uganda. One day I had to drop a story that was inspired by the practice of female genital mutilation amongst some communities in Uganda. I had strong interviews and had done thorough research, but everyone kept telling me it was not safe to go ahead. But it is still my home, my Uganda, my everything. I don't think anyone is free to exercise their art. And that includes artists. There is a cost for this freedom. Artists are no different to the entrepreneur in that financial resources are required for the capital outlay of the \"work\" or manuscript. Just to be in a position to indulge in the work is time spent creating a product without the immediate benefit of financial return. Then the work needs to be produced depending upon the format and genre, requiring additional resources. In the case of a writer, it is then given to a publisher, who spends even more resources to fine-tune the manuscript with an editor, proof reader, type setter, graphic designer etc. which could take considerable time before it is placed on the retail shelf. Since the work now becomes a joint investment, compromise is inevitable. So, I guess artists are free to tell their story if they have the resources to indulge in this freedom. There is a preconceived notion and expectations regarding African films. Only in recent years have young filmmakers begun to break the mould and make more experimental films. Funders have a clear idea of the African films they want. In most instances, those that depict African people in an unconventional light are not the stories funders and international festivals want to see. They are content to see Africa as a struggling continent, which is corrupt and disease-ridden. Many urban African stories don't ever reach beyond Africa because of the question: \"Are those really African stories?.\" The image and perception of African film is still very narrow. I want to tell African fantasy and surreal films, but the reaction is: \"Why? Don't you have more important issues that you need to address in your films?\" Each African film-maker has his own story to tell and we need to allow the \"strange for Africa\" films to co-exist with those that speak of identity, cultural and moral injustices, war, HIVAids etc. But things have changed slightly and filmmakers are finding alternative sources of funding - for instance, private investors - to tell stories they are passionate about. Are artists free to tell their own stories? This is a conscious choice each artist has to make. However, in the developing world, with most artists relying solely on their practice for their livelihood, they are forced to compromise their genuine stories with some \"fabricated reality\" that is sellable. This is further fuelled by the common perception that sales equal success, which leaves us caught up in creating fairy tales for sale. In oppressive environments, artists are intimidated and live in fear of censorship or consequences of defiance. In Kenya, having recently switched from the stereotypical African dictatorship that clamped down on creatives (mostly writers) to a more liberal government, artists whose work was inspired by bad governance, stemming from from semi-illiterate leadership, now have trouble remaining relevant. Tune in to the BBC World Service at 1900 GMT on Friday 1 March to listen to the BBC Africa Debate - Are artists free to tell their stories? - broadcast from Ouagadougou. Or take part in Twitter - using bbcafricadebate - Facebook or Google Africa Debate The whole funding situation further complicates the scenario. There's a big chunk of \"development\" aid and \"human rights\" funding channelled through non-governmental organisations. A handful of very prolific artists have gone mercenary. They've stopped making good art and have started championing the causes of civil society groups because the money is good. Artists are very free to tell their stories. A lot of factors may determine whether they do but in spaces with rampant poverty, very few can resist the temptation of a fistful of dollars to tell someone else's story. Artists just have to believe that their own stories are good enough. Filmmakers, unlike other artists such as painters and dancers, need money to practice their craft. And African filmmakers are especially burdened by a lack of money because our societies are financially strapped and they historically undervalue art. Our governments have different priorities and our businessmen see no financial value in supporting art. So African artists often find it impossible to tell their own stories. One way around that difficulty, I find, is crowd-funding. With many people making small donations, an artist can raise enough money to see through a vision that would otherwise be impossible to realise. That is how I completed my debut feature, Ninah's Dowry. But the lack of a speedy internet structure and limited access to credit cards still make crowd-funding a challenge on the continent. Another not-so-obvious deterrent to an artist's freedom is the requirement by some governments that artists submit scripts for approval before filming permits are granted. It is understandable for my beloved Cameroon, for example, to be touchy about military sites appearing onscreen. That is a credible national security issue. But, what happens if the artist's screenplay is critical of his government or country? Belonging to a very traditional society with conservative cultural values, I always have to make sure that what I say or what I do does not offend certain sensitivities. Which is not easy when you realise that the Festival in the Desert, while looking outward to the modern world, is organised by an indigenous people from a very traditionalist milieu. With the occupation of a large part of Mali and the prohibition of any form of artistic expression such as music, things became much more difficult. Expression itself was extremely risky because you exposed yourself to various punishments from the occupiers - including imprisonment. Even on the international level, to denounce what was happening could bring you trouble. At first you may be labelled as \"an enemy of Islam\" with all that implies in consequences for your daily life. However, this does not intimidate us because we are convinced that what we do is not against Islam. Our struggle is to show the values that are held by the majority of Muslims in the world, values of sharing and of tolerance. In its comparatively short history, African cinema has been viewed with considerable apathy and condescension both at home and abroad. No post-colonial African state in the continent has attempted to develop a cultural or film policy that incorporates critical debates, political and the poetic, since former Senegalese President Leopold Senghor's 1960s attempt with his idea of \"Negritude.\" With funding intertwined in various governmental departments and international development resources, film-makers are often forced to avoid making films dealing with their immediate surroundings. Instead, they produce films that are neither critical of social problems and national politics nor entertaining. That said, digital storytelling has presented film-makers with essential tools to battle for the freedom to create and distribute their work. In the last 10 years, young Africans have brought amazing energy to drama by embracing digital technology and therefore producing work that has been able to reach its audience across multiple platforms providing film-makers the freedom to imagine and free from the global hegemony.",
        "The grant will see six hectares of Broadcroft Quarry in Portland, Dorset, restored and opened as a trail. The two-year project is one of the first steps towards the main Jurassica attraction, which is planned in the 40m (132ft) deep quarry. The work will see a team of more than 100 volunteers work with conservation experts at the Dorset Wildlife Trust. Funding for the attraction is being raised through donations, grants and sponsorship from businesses. The proposed subterranean park on the World Heritage Site would see a glass and steel roof, about a third the size of the Millennium Dome, installed over the quarry. It would house an aquarium with robot swimming plesiosaurs, fossils and interactive displays. The charity behind the museum, which will cover three geological time periods, said it planned to submit a full planning application later this year. Sir David Attenborough is the project's patron and the Eden Project's Sir Tim Smit is its trustee. It also has the backing of the Royal Society and the Natural History Museum. Jurassica is the idea of science writer Michael Hanlon who died last year aged 51 after a heart attack.",
        "The US ambassador to Bangladesh condemned the killing of Xulhaz Mannan, who also worked at the US embassy. Another person was also injured when the attackers entered a Dhaka flat. Since February last year suspected militants have killed several secular or atheist writers and members of religious minority groups. The two men were murdered two days after a university teacher was hacked to death by suspected Islamist militants. So-called Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility - but the Bangladeshi government insists there is no IS presence in the country. Lurching from secularism to sectarian terror? Who is behind the Bangladesh killings? \"I am devastated by the brutal murder of Xulhaz Mannan and another young Bangladeshi,\" said US Ambassador Marcia Bernicat. \"We abhor this senseless act of violence and urge the government of Bangladesh in the strongest terms to apprehend the criminals behind these murders,\" she added. BBC Bengali Service editor Sabir Mustafa said staff at Roopbaan, a magazine and activist group for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community that had not been condemned by the government and received some support from foreign embassies, had been careful to protect their identities but had not believed their lives were at risk. Suspected extremists in Bangladesh are gaining a sense of security that they can carry out killings with impunity, he says. A British photographer who knew Mr Mannan and the other victim, known as \"Tonoy\" and named in Bangladeshi media as Tanay Mojumdar, said they and other friends had set up Roopbaan with the aim of spreading tolerance. Homosexuality is technically illegal in Bangladesh and remains a highly sensitive issue in society. Both men were openly gay and believed that if more gay Bangladeshis came out then the country would have to accept them, the photographer, who asked not to be named, said. They were also were behind the annual \"Rainbow Rally,\" held on Bengali New Year, 14 April, since 2014. This year's rally was banned by police as part of widespread security measures. \"Both were extremely gentle, non-violent and aware that being openly gay and active in their work was a personal danger,\" the photographer said. Their killings were likely to spread fear among Bangladesh's gay community, he said. \"Until a year ago the only threat to coming out was shame of the family and having to start a new life elsewhere in Bangladesh. Now it's one of danger,\" he said. Meanwhile Bangladesh's best known blogger said he had received a death threat on Sunday. Imran Sarker, who led major protests by secular activists in 2013 against Islamist leaders, said he had received a phone call warning that he would be killed \"very soon.\" Earlier this month, a Bangladeshi law student who had expressed secular views online died when he was hacked with machetes and then shot in Dhaka. Last year, four prominent secular bloggers were also killed with machetes. The four bloggers had all appeared on a list of 84 \"atheist bloggers\" drawn up by Islamic groups in 2013 and widely circulated. There have also been attacks on members of religious minorities including Shia, Sufi and Ahmadi Muslims, Christians and Hindus. Two foreigners - an Italian aid worker and a Japanese farmer - have also been killed. Muslim-majority Bangladesh is officially secular but critics say the government has failed to properly address the attacks.",

        "Mr Abbott told Australian media that the only way to prevent people dying at sea was to \"stop the boats.\" Australia detains any migrants trying to reach its shores by boat, and takes them to offshore processing camps to be eventually resettled elsewhere. On Thursday, the New York Times described the policy as \"brutal.\" In an editorial, the newspaper said the \"ruthlessly effective\" policy was \"inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war.\" It said it would be \"unconscionable\" for European leaders to consider adopting similar policies, as Mr Abbott has previously suggested. Australia has not responded to the editorial, but on Friday Mr Abbott said the image of Syrian three-year-old Alan Kurdi, who died trying to reach Greece by boat with his family, was \"very sad.\" \"If you want to stop the deaths, if you want to stop the drownings you have got to stop the boats,\" he told ABC Radio. \"Thankfully, we have stopped that in Australia because we have stopped the illegal boats.\" On Thursday, Mr Abbott angered Australian Jewish groups by saying the so-called Islamic State (IS), from which many of the migrants to Europe are fleeing, was worse than the Nazis. \"The Nazis did terrible evil, but they had a sufficient sense of shame to try to hide it,\" he told Sydney Radio 2GB. But IS militants, he said, \"boast about their evil, this is the extraordinary thing.\" The Executive Council of Australian Jewry Robert Goot said the comment was \"injudicious and unfortunate,\" saying there was \"a fundamental difference between organised acts of terrorism and a genocide systematically implemented by a state as essential policy.\" \"The crimes of Islamic State are indeed horrific but cannot be compared to the systematic round-up of millions of people and their despatch to purpose-built death camps for mass murder,\" he told Australian media.

        "Slovakian Imrich Joni, 20, stabbed and strangled Gordon Bolan, 68, at a flat in Kenmure Street in Pollokshields last summer. An earlier trial at the High Court in Edinburgh heard that Joni hid the pensioner's body in a wardrobe. Judge Lady Scott described it as \"a brutal murder\" which had left Mr Bolam's family \"utterly devastated.\" Joni, who lived at various addresses in the south side of Glasgow, murdered Mr Bolam at a date between 29 June and 14 July 2016. In April, he was found guilty of murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. When he appeared for sentencing on Tuesday, the court heard the 20-year-old - who had denied any wrongdoing during his week long trial - had now accepted he killed Mr Bolam. The court was told he had expressed \"genuine remorse\" for his actions because he could not continue living with \"the lie\" of denying his guilt. His trial heard that Joni struck Mr Bolam with a knife before throttling him with a piece of fabric at an address in Kenmure Street. He then concealed his victim's remains in a bedroom wardrobe. In a bid to cover up his crime and destroy DNA evidence, the murderer then washed upholstery, floors and other surfaces. He also got rid of his trainers and the clothing he was wearing on the day he murdered Mr Bolam. But Joni was caught after detectives found his DNA around Mr Bolam's property. Forensic scientists also discovered his DNA on the ligature which was placed around Mr Bolam's throat. Defence advocate John Scott QC told the court that his client was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder caused by years of being physically abused by a family member. Telling Joni that he was likely to be deported from the UK following his release from custody, judge Lady Scott said: \"Mr Bolam was a man who struggled with ill health but nevertheless lived a normal life. He was a much-loved member of his community. \"His family have been left bereft and utterly devastated by his death. \"I accept that you have expressed genuine remorse. I also take into account that you have suffered emotional and physical abuse and that you are a young man with post traumatic stress disorder. \"This was a brutal murder. Balancing all these factors I have decided that you must serve at least 13 years before you become eligible to apply for parole.\"",
        "The Curriculum for Excellence, which has been four years in the making, aims to give teachers more freedom and make lessons less prescriptive. Some teachers, unions and opposition parties have expressed concern the curriculum is not ready. But Scottish ministers have given assurances it will improve standards. Education Secretary Mike Russell said the current system was not being largely re-written. The changes, for children between the ages of three and 18, which are already in place in primary schools, aim to focus more on teaching methods rather than content, and seek to make young people more resourceful and responsible. The system will be introduced for children in their first year of secondary school, and will be rolled out year on year until it is implemented for all secondary years. Speaking on BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Russell said, \"We already know that in the primary sector, this is a successful means of imparting education. \"The rules of physics and the grammar of French don't change as a result of that, but what does happen is that teaching methods improve. \"I'm confident that it will produce the results that Scotland needs - a well-educated group of young people and a well-educated work force.\" However, Eleanor Coner of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council told BBC Scotland that although related exams are still a few years off, parents are concerned about the lack of communication over the new curriculum. She said: \"I was speaking to a parent last night who said she just can't get her head round it and that she just doesn't understand anything about it. \"I think the problem is that the messages that have been sent out can be quite confusing at times. There needs to be more information like this on what is happening, and this is what it means for your child.\" Mr Russell said he had written to the parents of each child affected by the new system, and he had been visiting schools around the country to speak to parents and teachers. Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems have raised concerns that the new curriculum is still too vague and have questioned whether enough funding has been made available to deliver it. In March, Mr Russell rejected calls by secondary teachers to delay the introduction of the curriculum. Some unions have expressed concerns that their members will not be ready to introduce the new system and pledged to create specialist groups in subject areas to provide the right support. Labour education spokesman Des McNulty claimed SNP cuts were a threat to the new curriculum. He said: \"Newly qualified teachers are unable to get jobs and school budgets are under their tightest pressure than at any point in the last decade because the SNP have failed to prioritise our schools. \"The vital materials and information needed for the successful implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence has not yet been provided and many teachers feel the support they were promised has not been delivered by the SNP.\" The Liberal Democrats said they supported the curriculum but said Mr Russell's handling of the situation was \"shambolic.\" Education spokeswoman Margaret Smith said: \"I'm pleased that teachers are excited about teaching the new curriculum, but as children return to school today, there are still no criteria for the new national exams replacing Standard Grades. \"Teachers have to start teaching the new curriculum, but with no idea about the exams that they should be preparing children for.\"",
        "Andrew Haldane said in a speech he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks. \"Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier,\" Mr Haldane said. \"This implies interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago.\" Global markets have tumbled this week, with investors disconcerted at the lack of growth in Europe and especially Greece, the impact of Ebola, and worrying economic data from China and the US. Previously, UK interest rates had been expected to rise early next year. Mr Haldane made his remarks at a speech to local business leaders in Kenilworth, where he described the UK's economy as \"writhing in both agony and ecstasy.\" He said there were still plenty of reasons to be cheerful. Growth is set to be the fastest of any major economy this year and inflation and borrowing costs are low, he said. However, he said the \"reasons to be fearful\" included productivity and wages, which had not risen. \"If there is genuine uncertainty about the path of the economy, the optimal policy response may be to avoid the worst outcomes,\" said Mr Haldane. Sterling dropped 0.5 against the dollar following his remarks. Share trading on the London market has been volatile. Mr Haldane's caution about global economic prospects were echoed by the Chancellor, George Osborne, who told the BBC that the worldwide economy was \"more unstable than it has been for some time.\" Mr Osborne would not comment on Mr Haldane's remarks. But he said there were \"a lot of global risks out there at the moment\" affecting the international economy. \"Interest rates are entirely a matter for the independent Bank of England, the monetary policy committee there,\" Mr Osborne said. He added: \"I'll say this about the economy more generally - there are clearly a lot of global risks out there at the moment - we see these problems in the European economy, we've got this horrific disease Ebola in West Africa, all the problems in the Middle East and in the Ukrainian border. \"The global economy is more unstable than it has been for some time. That is all the more reason why in the UK we have to stick to the stability we have won.\" He said it was important to \"make sure Britain is well protected as we're in these stormy international economic waters.\" Earlier this month, Mr Osborne warned that the eurozone slowdown will impact UK economy.",

The story of the feud formed the core of the 2010 film \"The Social Network.\" The row dates from 2003 when the Winklevosses hired Mr Zuckerberg to write code for their ConnectU site while at Harvard. He never did, but instead set up Facebook, which quickly became a success around the world. A court case over who did what was resolved in 2008 when the parties agreed on a financial settlement, reportedly worth around 65m (PS41m). In January 2011 the Winklevosses tried to reopen the case, seeking more money. However, a US appeals court ruled in April that they would have to accept the settlement. The twins initially said they would appeal against the settlement, but decided this week not to pursue that legal avenue. In the most recent suit filed on Thursday with the US District Court of Massachusetts, the Winklevosses and their business partner Divya Narendra said that Facebook hid some crucial information from them during settlement proceedings. The twins said that Mr Zuckerberg did not disclose some important documents in regards to the relationship between him and the brothers while they were at Harvard. Facebook's outside counsel Neel Chatterjee said in a statement: \"These are old and baseless allegations that have been considered and rejected previously by the courts.\"",
        "The profit included a'write back' of PS27m in impairment charges. That means money which had been set aside to cover expected losses can now be released as loans performed better than expected. These are the first performance figures the bank has published since a corporate reorganisation in 2015. At that time the bank's parent company, RBS, split Ulster Bank's Irish operation into separate businesses, north and south of the border. Richard Donnan, head of Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland, said the results also showed a 6 decline in operating costs from PS154m to PS145m. \"We still have work to do to manage our costs in order to grow our business in a sustainable way, but we have made significant progress on that front,\" he said. \"I am pleased that we have impairment write backs of PS27m, driven by improved residential and commercial property market conditions.\" In March, the bank said it would close nine of its 64 branches from October. Ulster Bank is one of the big four local banks in Northern Ireland, employing about 2,200 staff. In 2016 RBS, which is 72-government owned, reported a PS7bn annual loss.",
        "Amina Al-Jeffery, 21, who was born and brought up in Swansea, was taken to Jeddah in 2012 by her father, Mohammed, who said he did it to \"save her life.\" Mr Al-Jeffery has denied the allegations at the High Court. But Mr Justice Holman said she had been \"deprived of her liberty\" and her father must facilitate her return. Ms Al-Jeffery, who has dual nationality, says her father took the action against her will after she \"kissed a guy.\" Delivering the court order, Mr Justice Holman said Mr Al-Jeffery \"must permit and facilitate the return of Amina if she so wishes to Wales or England and pay the airfare\" by 11 September. However, he accepted there was \"little or nothing this court could do\" to enforce the order if Mr Al-Jeffery \"was determined not to comply with it.\" But he said Mr Al-Jeffery might face contempt of court proceedings if he returned to Britain without having complied. Mr Justice Holman added: \"There are no conventions between Britain and Saudi Arabia. The courts in Saudi Arabia would not even recognise the basis of the claim, because it does not recognise dual nationality.\" Her lawyer, Anne-Marie Hutchinson QC, said she has been unable to take instruction from Ms Al-Jeffery, who sent her emails in December 2015. She said she had been \"physically abused\" and there were times when she had not been allowed to leave her room, meaning she had to use it as a toilet. She described having her head smacked against the wall. Ms Hutchinson later told BBC Newsnight it had been a \"difficult\" but \"compelling\" case to work on. \"I'm absolutely delighted that the judge has said he has got jurisdiction and that he has gone on to exercise his jurisdiction and make orders. \"I'm expecting him [Mr Al-Jeffery,] to comply with the order,\" she said. Mr Al-Jeffery, who did not attend the case, denied his daughter wanted to return to England or Wales. He said he put up a barrier partition to stop her running away because he was concerned for her welfare, which was taken down on the advice of the authorities. He said he wanted to make sure Ms Al-Jeffery was safe and was not being mistreated. Neither Amina nor her father were in court to hear the ruling. And the question now is what difference a ruling in the High Court of England and Wales will make in Saudi Arabia. Mr Justice Holman said he accepted that there is \"little or nothing\" this court could do to enforce the order if Amina's father was determined not to obey or comply with it. Certainly the basis on which it was granted, that Amina has dual British and Saudi nationality, is not recognised in Saudi Arabia. And it is perhaps telling that Mohammed Al-Jeffery's legal costs have been paid for by the Saudi embassy. However, the judge stated that to do nothing \"would in my view amount to a dereliction towards Amina.\" The court was told that in April Mr Al-Jeffery instigated legal proceedings against his daughter in Jeddah \"seeking parental control over his child for the purposes of caring and supervision.\" Legal documentation showed both father and daughter agreed to a reconciliation. But Mr Justice Holman said that meant if \"she were to run away the police, far from offering her protection from her father, would put her in prison.\" Mr Justice Holman said: \"If Amina chooses to remain voluntarily in Saudi Arabia she must of course adhere to the law and culture of that society but the current constraint is denying to her the ability to be British and to live in Britain. \"It is true that she is currently present and habitually resident in Saudi Arabia, but that is due to her obedience to her father in 2012. She did not travel there of her own free will.\" He said Mr Al-Jeffery \"voluntarily chose to live for many years in Wales, to educate and bring his children up here.... and to accept the constraints of the legal system of England and Wales.\" The judge said the fact Ms Al-Jeffery was born and brought up in Britain until she was almost 17 was a \"very significant factor\" in his decision. The court was told Mr Al-Jeffery's wife, from whom he is not estranged, and several of his children continue to live in the UK. Swansea West MP Geraint Davies has written to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to demand immediate action over the case. The former Swansea schoolgirl has been in touch with friends in the UK and asked them to contact the British Embassy to inform them of her situation, and has also sent a picture of what she claimed was the caged room her father had kept her in. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: \"We recognise that this is a distressing time for Ms Al-Jeffery. We have been providing assistance to her since the case was first brought to our attention and will continue to do so. \"British embassy staff have met with her to check on her welfare and helped her speak to lawyers in the UK.\"",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device But a six-under 65 from Henrik Stenson left the Swede only one shot behind. Denmark's Soren Kjeldsen (68) and American Keegan Bradley (68) are three shots off the lead, two clear of defending champion Zach Johnson (70). Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy shot 71 in the worst of the weather to finish eight shots off the pace. Media playback is not supported on this device Andrew Johnston is the highest-placed Briton on four under, the Englishman recovering from a triple bogey at the fearsome 11th to record an impressive 69. Meanwhile, Germany's two-time major winner Martin Kaymer got to seven under but triple bogeyed the 10th and finished with a 73 for three under. The wind blew harder and the rain fell heavier after Mickelson reached the safety of the clubhouse, destroying the chances of a host of big names. World number three Jordan Spieth shot a 75 to finish right on four-over-par and just make the cut, as did England's Masters champion Danny Willett, Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell, and Scottish duo Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie. England's former US Open champion Justin Rose shot a 77 to finish three over, while world number one Jason Day battled to a 70 to finish one over. US Open champion and world number two Dustin Johnson had two double bogeys but still managed a 69 for two under overall. World number five Bubba Watson holed a birdie at the last to extend his stay. The two-time Masters champion double-bogeyed 11 and struggled to a 76 and four-over total. Media playback is not supported on this device Mickelson, winner of the Claret Jug in 2013, carded a 63 on Thursday, the joint-lowest round in major history and the 46-year-old's 36-hole total of 132 is a record for an Open at Royal Troon. The five-time major winner told BBC Sport: \"If I look back to my mid-30s, I am 35lbs lighter, in better shape than I was and can manage the symptoms of my psoriatic arthritis. I feel stronger and in a better condition than I have ever been. \"I can't see why I can't play my best golf in the coming years. I am optimistic about this week and the coming years and the opportunities to add to my resume.\" Mickelson teed off in overcast but benign conditions and covered the front nine in 33 shots, very nearly acing the eighth hole. It started to rain when he hit the turn and he dropped his first shot of the tournament at the par-four 12th, but ground things out as others wilted. Mickelson's feats were brought into sharper focus by the efforts of playing partners Lee Westwood and Ernie Els, who started their rounds on level par. England's Westwood carded a 73, while two-time Open champion Els shot a five-over 76 and missed the cut by one shot. Media playback is not supported on this device World number six Stenson, runner-up to Mickelson in 2013, made six birdies and one bogey as his attempt to become the first Scandinavian to win a major title gathered momentum. \"I haven't been in contention for the last six majors so it was a big goal of mine to give myself a good chance here. So far, so good,\" said Stenson. \"I'm 40, so might only have another dozen goes. So I better start putting myself in position and giving myself chances.\" The affable Johnston, winner of the Spanish Open in May, is a developing something of a cult following. Johnston is nicknamed'Beef', which prompted fans to wave burgers at him as he made his way from the 15th green. \"My mum, sister and niece are here,\" said the 27-year-old Londoner. \"My niece is five. I can hear her shouting out'Uncle Beef' on every hole. Today she came out with'Beef to the rescue!' She cracks me up.\" Johnston is tied for sixth with Americans Tony Finau (71) and Bill Haas (70), former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel (66) and Spain's Sergio Garcia (70). South Africa's 2010 champion Louis Oosthuizen had five bogeys, a double bogey and a quintuple-bogey nine in a humbling round of 83. Ben Curtis, Open champion in 2003, recorded a sextuple-bogey 10 at the par-four fourth, hitting his ball into three different bunkers. He also shot an 83. The last two champions at Troon, Todd Hamilton and Justin Leonard, also missed the cut after finishing six over.

        "Mazembe made sure of the win having held their opponents to a 1-1 draw in Algeria in the first leg of the final last weekend. They won the final 5-2 on aggregate, to add the Confederation Cup to their list of honours after winning the African Champions League in 2015. On Sunday, Mazembe went ahead in Lubumbashi after just seven minutes through Merveille Bope who reacted quickest to a Jean Kasusula free- kick which hit the woodwork. Zambia international Kalaba (pictured) hammered home a volley on the stroke of halftime to make it 2-0 and scored again just after the hour mark to put the result beyond the Algerians, appearing in their first continental cup final. Bejaia scored a consolation goal in the 75th minute from Sofiane Khadir but the three-goal advantage was restored within 60 seconds by Jonathan Bolingi. Mazembe were eliminated early in the defence of their African Champions League trophy this year and dropped down to the continent's second tier club competition. They will receive 660,000 following their Confederation Cup triumph with Bejaia receiving the runners-up prize of 462,000. Mazembe will now play this year's African Champions League winners, Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa, in the 2017 African Super Cup on the weekend on 17-19 February.",
        "The Parkhead side have agreed a fee with Hibernian for midfielder Allan, who is a boyhood Rangers fan. BBC Scotland has learned that Allan would consider joining the Premiership champions. \"He just looks to me a guy that could probably handle that type of situation,\" said Ferguson. \"He's a class act in my opinion. If he went to Celtic, I think his performance level would go up a notch. He's got a bit of gallous-ness about him; a swagger. \"What I would say is that if a big club like Celtic comes calling, I think it's a no-brainer. You've got to take that opportunity because getting the opportunity to sign, whether it's a Rangers or Celtic - one of the bigger clubs - you don't knock it back.\" Rangers have had three bids for the 23-year-old rejected, with the Edinburgh side adamant they will not do business with a Championship rival. Allan submitted a transfer request following the second of those offers from Ibrox. Ferguson spent seven years at Rangers between 1983 and 1990 and admitted he could not have made the switch to city rivals Celtic, but recalled the time when one former Celtic player famously joined the Ibrox club. \"In the era I played in, personally, no,\" he told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound programme. \"I think it would take a certain type of character. I was at Rangers when Mo Johnston signed. I thought he was crazy. I think Mo was one of the guys that could handle that situation. \"It was amazing because I remember the times when season tickets and scarves were thrown onto the pitch. The Rangers fans would not turn up and watch Rangers Football Club, but when Mo Johnston started banging in the goals, those empty seats started to fill up. \"It's about what you do on the park at the end of the day.\" Someone who has witnessed first-hand what Allan can produce on the pitch is former Hibs captain Liam Craig, who played with the ex-West Brom man at Easter Road during the 2014-15 season. Craig believes Allan has the \"character\" to go onto great things at Parkhead if the transfer materialises. \"Could he go and play in Celtic's team? I think he could,\" he told BBC Radio Scotland \"I think Hibs are right not to do business with Rangers. They know how important Scott is to them and how close it's going to be between them and Rangers this season. \"Probably what Hibs don't want is, come January, when there's six months left on his contract, he goes and signs a pre-contract with Rangers. Then do you play him? Can you trust him? \"So if there is the opportunity there to do business with Celtic and bring in one, maybe two players from them on loan, you're going to strengthen your squad and have a right push for the title this season. \"If Scotty was to go there, it might take him a wee bit time to get in but once he gets in he's definitely got the ability to and the confidence to stay in that team every week.\"",
        "The 24-year-old Belgium-born midfielder has made just 23 Premier League starts since joining from Porto on a five-and-a-half-year contract in February 2016. \"Sometimes things just don't pan out as you hope,\" Hughes said. \"It has been a frustration for all parties involved. It's fair to say with Giannelli that things haven't quite worked out.\" Imbula became Portuguese football's record signing when he joined Porto in a PS15.1m deal from Marseille in July 2015. \"He hasn't quite adjusted to the Premier League,\" added Hughes. \"If there is interest in him then we would consider that. We haven't had any interest, in fairness, but we would look at things if the right offer came in.\"",

        "Vokes is now tied to the Turf Moor club until the end of the 2018-19 season. \"My massive goal is to do well at club level and play at the Euros in the summer,\" Vokes told BBC Radio Wales. The 26-year-old, who has six goals in 37 games for his country, has been with the Clarets since joining from Wolves in July 2012. He has scored 31 goals in 137 appearances in all competitions for Burnley, with a total of 64 in 300 career games. He has netted five times in 27 games for Sean Dyche's side this season. \"It's great to put pen to paper, I've been very happy at Burnley, it's a club I've found a home at in the last few years,\" he said. \"We are concentrating on pushing for promotion and that was a massive factor in signing the new deal, the belief I have in the club. \"Promotion is a big aim and I think we've got the squad to do that.\" A spot in Chris Coleman's 23-man squad for Wales' first major football tournament since 1958 this summer is another priority. \"I'm not guaranteed a spot, it's never a given or something I'd take for granted. You need to be playing well for your club to be picked for your country,\" Vokes added. \"I need to do well this season and that gives me the best chance of going to France and forcing my way into the team.\" Vokes' 2014-15 campaign was hampered by a cruciate ligament injury but has suffered no problems since having surgery. \"Three-and-a-half more years shows faith from the club in me and they stood by me with my injury,\" he said. \"I'm over the injury, it's behind me now, but the club were great with me. \"Playing week in and week out has helped.\"",
        "One of the highest ranking military officials of his time, more than 30 places around the world now bear his name. In Guernsey, where he was governor for 24 years, a school, a road and a former hospital were named after him. However, in the US Lord Amherst has become a dubious figure because of his connection with biological warfare. Earlier this year students at liberal arts institution Amherst College, Massachusetts, voted to remove'Lord Jeff' as their unofficial mascot in light of accusations he approved the wiping out of Native Americans by deliberately giving them smallpox via infected blankets. As the commander-in-chief of the British army in pre-independence north America, Jeffery Amherst is said to have \"both despised and hated his enemy\" according to the historian Henry Morse Stephens. In a postscript to a fellow British officer Henry Bouquet, he appears to have written: \"You will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race. \"I should be very glad your scheme for hunting them down by dogs could take effect, but England is at too great a distance to think of that at present.\" Other higher education institutions including the University of Cape Town and Oxford University have faced student protests because of their association with another colonial figure, the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. The'Rhodes Must Fall' campaign led to UCT removing a statue of the 19th Century politician. Professor Elizabeth Fenn, an historian at the University of Colorado, who researched the Amherst smallpox incident told the BBC: \"I am relieved and delighted to see the wholehearted rejection of Jeffery Amherst. \"He advocated genocide, the'total erxtirpation' of native peoples. The question we should ask is why did it take us so long?\" In Montreal more than 6,500 people signed an online petition to rename the city's Amherst Street after a former Premier of Quebec Jacques Parizeau, who died in 2015. The campaign, launched that year, continues. Some researchers have argued that the British general deserves an honourable position in history for his personal achievements, one of which was the capture of Montreal in 1760. Morse Stephens wrote: \"Though not a great man.... his personal qualities were undeniable, and he could not have been an ordinary man to have risen from page to Duke of Dorset to be field-marshal commanding-in-chief.\" Whether Sir Jeffery Amherst ever visited Guernsey during his time as governor of the island is not known, but his legacy lives on today in several places; Amherst Primary School, Amherst Road and the Amherst Room at Castle Cornet. There was an Amherst Maternity Hospital in St Peter Port but the site was redeveloped for housing. Local historian, Colonel Richard Graham, said that Lord Amherst had been viewed as a national hero \"in whose reflected glory Guernsey bathed over the 24 years of his time in office.\" So have recent events overseas had any bearing on the general's reputation in Guernsey? Mr Graham said historical figures like Jeffery Amherst should be judged by the standards of their time. \"I believe strongly that they should be judged and accepted by the mores of the time they lived rather than by ours. \"In a hundred years' time, our actions will be similarly scrutinised and there will be some judgemental souls who will see evil in stuff we currently regard as harmless. \"That is not to say that hideous conduct as seen in the evils of Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot are any the less hideous for having taken place when they did and within the world as it was. \"But even these abominations need to be explained and understood as if from their time if the appropriate lessons are to be drawn from history.\" The island's Education Department and a St Peter Port Parish official told the BBC that no one had approached them about renaming local places called Amherst.",
        "Wilson was airlifted to hospital from the Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania after Sage Karam's car spun and crashed in front of him on lap 179 of 200. Debris from Karam's car hit ex-Formula 1 driver Wilson, 37, and the Andretti Autosport driver crashed into a wall. IndyCar officials said his death was a \"monumentally sad day.\" Mark Miles, chief executive of IndyCar parent company Hulman Co, said: \"Justin's elite ability to drive a race car was matched by his unwavering kindness, character and humility - which is what made him one of the most respected members of the paddock. \"As we know, the racing industry is one big family, and our efforts moving forward will be focused on rallying around Justin's family to ensure they get the support they need during this unbelievably difficult time.\" A seven-time IndyCar race winner, Wilson, from Sheffield, is survived by his wife, Julia, and two daughters. In a statement his family said he was a \"loving father and devoted husband, as well as a highly competitive racing driver who was respected by his peers.\" His brother Stefan, also a racing driver, paid tribute on social media, saying: \"Can't even begin to describe the loss I feel right now. He was my brother, my best friend, my role model and mentor. He was a champion. \"He lived for this sport, he loved it. The only comfort I feel is that he lived a life he loved.\" An Andretti Autosport team statement said: \"He was a tremendous racer, a valuable member of the team and respected representative to our sport. While Justin was only part of the Andretti line-up for a short time, it only took a second for him to forever become part of the Andretti family. \"His life and racing career is a story of class and passion surpassed by none.\" Wilson was making his 174th IndyCar start in Sunday's race, but his major motorsport breakthrough came in F1. He won the Formula 3000 series in 2001, and two years later raised PS1.2m to finance his F1 entry after setting up a company in his own name. Standing at 6ft 4in, Wilson was unusually tall for F1 - drivers over six feet are a rarity - and he scored his only point from 16 races with Minardi and Jaguar during 2003 at the United States Grand Prix. He moved to the United States in 2004 and enjoyed greater success in Champ Car, finishing as series runner-up in 2006 and 2007 before switching to IndyCar racing in 2008, after Champ Car merged with the Indy Racing League. He finished second in the previous IndyCar race in Mid-Ohio on 2 August, his first podium finish since 2013, while his final victory came at the Firestone 550 at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2012. His appearance at the triangle-shaped Pocono Raceway was only his sixth of this season as he struggled to find a full-time seat. In the past 20 years there have been seven deaths during race meetings in IndyCar, including in the series' previous incarnations as Champ Car and Indy Racing League. In that time one F1 driver has been killed - Wilson's death comes 38 days after Frenchman Jules Bianchi succumbed to the devastating injuries he sustained at last year's Japanese Grand Prix. Four years ago British driver and two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon lost his life aged 33 at the Las Vegas Indy 300. Wheldon was killed when his head hit a post in the fence at Las Vegas Motor Speedway after a crash involving 15 vehicles. His death triggered calls for further safety reviews, including suggestions that open-wheel racing be banned on high-speed, oval tracks, where tightly-packed cars reach speeds of 230mph. IndyCar officials have introduced several safety measures into the sport. This includes safer walls, collapsible barriers designed to cushion impact and the installation of trauma centres at race tracks. McLaren driver Jenson Button is one of many Formula 1 figures to have paid tribute to Wilson. \"I raced with Justin as far back as 1989 in karting and remember his smile was infectious,\" he tweeted. \"The motorsport world comes to a standstill once again. Justin Wilson was a great person and racing driver. My thoughts are with his family.\" World champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram: \"I am so devastated to hear of another passing of a great man and driver. I'd met Justin Wilson a few times growing up and he was the ultimate gentleman. Whilst I only knew him a little, I will miss him. We will miss him.\" Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, former Minardi owner Paul Stoddart, who gave Wilson his first start in F1,said: \"Motorsport has lost not just a fantastic driver but one of the true gentleman of the sport. \"Justin wasn't just a very fast and capable driver but a true gentleman and one of the nicest guys you could ever hope to meet in the paddock.\" Scotland's four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti said: \"Rest in peace Justin, it was a real privilege to know you and call you a friend.\" Nine-time F1 winner Mark Webber, who competed alongside Wilson at Minardi in 2003, tweeted: \"Last night a very good man left us. So sorry. RIP Justin. My thoughts are with your loved ones.\" Sage Karam, who was leading the race at the time of the crash, has been released from hospital after treatment for heel and wrist injuries. \"I can't find the proper words to describe the pain and sympathy I feel for Justin and his family,\" he said on social media.",

        "The clause backing \"common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange,\" was scrapped under Tony Blair in 1995. Speaking to the Independent on Sunday, Mr Corbyn said Labour \"shouldn't shy away\" from public control of railways and public investment in industry. Leadership rival Liz Kendall told the paper Clause IV belonged in the past. Tony Blair's move two decades ago to ditch the long-standing commitment in Labour's constitution to public ownership was seen by some as a symbolic step which made the party more electable in the post-Margaret Thatcher era. The original wording of Clause IV was replaced with a new commitment to \"a thriving private sector and high-quality public services where those undertakings essential to the common good are either owned by the public or accountable to them.\" Mr Corbyn told the IoS he could consider bringing back the old Clause IV as part of a commitment to take \"necessary things\" back into public ownership. \"I think we should talk about what the objectives of the party are, whether that's restoring the Clause IV as it was originally written or it's a different one, but I think we shouldn't shy away from public participation, public investment in industry and public control of the railways,\" he said. \"I'm interested in the idea that we have a more inclusive, clearer set of objectives. I would want us to have a set of objectives which does include public ownership of some necessary things such as rail.\" Mr Corbyn's campaign momentum seems unflagging - to the alarm of senior figures in the party. But he says the party needs a new statement of objectives - and that could be the original Clause IV. Jeremy Corbyn has already promised to renationalise energy companies and the railways and increase public spending on industry. One of Mr Corbyn's leadership rivals, Liz Kendall, condemned the idea as a \"throwback to the past.\" Some party donors are alarmed by the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn win too. Businessman Assem Allam, who donated PS300,000 to Labour during the election, has told the Sunday Telegraph he would stop giving money to the party if Mr Corbyn becomes leader, saying he never backed a \"dead horse.\" Mr Corbyn is one of four candidates standing in next month's Labour leader election, alongside Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham. Ms Kendall - the leadership challenger seen as being the closest to Mr Blair's policies - fiercely condemned the idea of bringing back Clause IV. \"This shows there is nothing new about Jeremy Corbyn's politics,\" she said. \"Life had moved on from the old Clause IV in 1994, let alone 2015. We are a party of the future, not a preservation society.\" At-a-glance profiles of the four contenders",
        "The city council said developing the Bannerdale site, off Carter Knowle Road, posed no risk to health. It said it had carried out extensive investigations into any potential risks. Campaigners have raised concerns over possible health risks and increased traffic if the build goes ahead. More on this story and others on Local Live Yorkshire The development, which includes sports facilities and a 1,200 place secondary school, attracted more than 80 objections. However, Joel Hardwick, Schools Organisation Manager at Sheffield City Council, said: \"It's really important to stress that we would never build a school on land that was unsafe. \"We know that it is a suitable and safe place to build an excellent new school to serve the south west of Sheffield.\" The authority said the birth rate in Sheffield had increased by 25 since 2002, with 1,000 more children per year entering education. It said the area earmarked for the school was a popular location for young families and the additional places were needed to meet demand. Opponents said air pollution and traffic congestion were already a problem in the area and would be made worse by the school, which they claimed was not needed. They also raised concerns about possible health risks posed by waste from the former landfill site, and the loss of green space. The plans were approved at a meeting on Tuesday.",
        "A ruling will allow users and expert analysts to carry out repairs. But changes such as extracting and selling code would still breach copyright. Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues. The ruling follows claims the right to modify software could have prevented the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported. Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation. \"Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented,\" the statement said. Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright. Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are \"pervasive\" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices. \"We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers,\" said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions deceit, the EFF said car manufacturers' software should not be protected from independent scrutiny. \"When you entrust your health, safety, or privacy to a device, the law shouldn't punish you for trying to understand how that device works and whether it is trustworthy,\" Walsh blogged. The new rules must be renewed in three years, he said. Some US government agencies expressed serious reservations about the new rules, and the Environmental Protection Agency flatly opposed them. \"EPA explained that vehicle modifications are often performed to increase engine power or boost fuel economy, but that these modifications increase vehicle emissions and thus violate the Clean Air Act,\" the Library of Congress said in its final rule. However, the new rules do not allow vehicle owners to break any other laws, the Library said, and will not take effect for a year so the EPA and other agencies have time to prepare.",
        "In 2013, the Italian composer was reported as saying he wouldn't work with Tarantino because he \"places music in his films without coherence.\" But the 87-year-old told the BBC he had no issues with how the director incorporated his older works into films like Kill Bill and Django Unchained. \"On the contrary, I was very, very flattered,\" he said. \"The fact that my music, which had been written for other films, could be adapted to the poetry of Quentin Tarantino's film-making was a great gift for me. \"The only thing I criticised of Quentin Tarantino was a single scene in a single movie which, for me, was too violent and too ghastly. I couldn't watch it.\" Speaking through an interpreter, the maestro said his original comments had been mis-reported, adding: \"People should pay a lot of attention when they write something down.\" The pair have now collaborated for the first time, with the Italian maestro penning the soundtrack for Tarantino's upcoming film The Hateful Eight. It marks the first time the composer has scored a Western since his career-defining work with Sergio Leone on films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also a first for Tarantino - who has never commissioned a full orchestral score for one of his films before, preferring to rely on old soundtracks and classic pop records. Morricone says it was Tarantino's dense script that persuaded him to work on the project. \"It was this thick,\" he says, indicating a document several times thicker than War and Peace. \"He actually came to Rome just to convince me, to my house. \"It was very easy for me to say yes because the script was very, very relevant and interesting and full of detail.\" The Hateful Eight, which is released in January, reunites Tarantino with several of his regular players - Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern - as well as newcomers Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir and Channing Tatum. Set roughly a decade after the US Civil War, it finds an eclectic group of law-keepers, outlaws, mercenaries, bounty hunters and fugitives trapped in a stagecoach waypoint by a massive snowstorm. As the plot unfurls, they begin to wonder whether they'll make it out alive. The score's key movement is a seven-minute suite called L'Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud. \"The main instruments introducing this piece are the bassoon, the contra-bassoon and the tuba,\" he says. \"And this is very strange because I have never done that in the past. \"The sound these instruments produce can express the drama, the rage, the despair and the irony that are the main themes of Tarantino's story. They are a healthy, bodily sound. They also express a criticism towards the leading characters of the film.\" A sinister, brooding passage of music, it will form the centrepiece of the composer's world tour next year, celebrating his 60 years in the film industry. Despite his age - and the lingering pain from a back injury he sustained last year - Morricone says he is \"looking forward\" to the concerts, and finds playing themes from films such as The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and A Fistful of Dollars an \"incredibly gratifying experience.\" The composer has scored more than 500 films, sold more than 70 million albums, scored a top 10 single in the UK (with Chi Mai in 1982) and received an honorary Oscar - but he has no intention of resting on his laurels. \"I've been working for many years and the sum of all these experiences led me always to improve, to do better,\" he says. \"Every piece of work I do adds something to my experience and my style, and brings something new.\" And had he been able to stomach the violence in Tarantino's latest movie? \"The fact I don't like those sequences is not a problem. It's a question of my personal sensitivity,\" he says. \"I would go to the extent to say that maybe he can afford to include those violent sequences because it's part of his poetry. \"The world can be a very cruel place and he has a wonderful way of describing this cruelty.\" The Hateful Eight is out in the UK on 8 January. Morricone's soundtrack will be released by Decca on 18 December.",
        "The couple married in the 28-year-old tennis star's hometown of Dunblane in April. It is understood that Kim, 27, has recently had her 12-week scan, with the baby due in February. Murray's mother Judy recently told a magazine that she was \"really looking forward to being a granny.\" Murray enjoyed a strong run of form after marrying his long-term girlfriend in front of family and friends at Dunblane Cathedral on 11 April. He reached the semi-finals of the French Open and Wimbledon, and won his first titles on clay. Speaking to Sky Sports earlier this year, he said: \"It (marriage) has been nice and a lot of people have spoken about the honeymoon period. \"But we've been together a very long time and getting married was the next step.\" Murray fans were quick to congratulate the couple after news of the pregnancy was reported, tweeting him their best wishes.",
        "Williams driver Felipe Massa suffered two left-rear wheel failures and Renault's Kevin Magnussen a suspected broken left rear suspension. The session was stopped for 30 minutes as officials launched an investigation and cleared the track of debris. Williams had a wheel problem. Renault's turned out to be a suspension failure. Williams driver Valtteri Bottas said the team had found a problem with the \"rim clearance\" - the distance between the wheel and the wheel assembly - and that he had had the same problem as Massa but had been \"more lucky.\" \"If there is something under the rim too close, that can cause problems,\" the Finn said. Both Massa's failures happened on his first lap out of the pits on the entry to the Turn Six hairpin. On the first, Massa was pitched into a spin. On the second, he did not lose control, but the tyre appeared to simply pop off the rim. There were no clear television pictures of the failure on Magnussen's car. Williams did not send either of its cars out again when the session was re-started with eight minutes remaining. Magnussen, who had broken rear suspension, was also consigned to the pits. In a busy final few minutes of running, Rosberg supplanted early pace-setter Hamilton at the top of the times with a lap of one minute 38.037 seconds. The world champion was 0.146secs behind in the second Mercedes. Rosberg returned to the pits at the end of the session in \"limp-home mode,\" his engineer telling him over the radio that he thought there was \"an engine issue.\" Mercedes later diagnosed it as an ignition problem and said they hoped it would be solved for second practice. Hamilton already knows that he has a five-place grid drop from wherever he qualifies because of a gearbox change after the team discovered a potential problem and decided not to risk a retirement. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was third quickest, 0.628secs off the pace and 0.396secs quicker than Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in fourth. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was fifth, ahead of Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat, Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz and the McLaren of Jenson Button. Fernando Alonso returned to the McLaren after being forced to miss the last race in Bahrain because of a broken rib sustained in his high-speed crash at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. The Spaniard faces further medical checks after the first session to establish whether he will be allowed to continue for the rest of the weekend but he made no public reports of any physical discomfort. Alonso was 12th fastest, 0.564secs slower than Button. Chinese Grand Prix first practice results Chinese Grand Prix coverage details",
        "Sir Peter Blake received Liverpool's Citizen of Honour at a ceremony at the city's Liver building. The 84-year-old also gave Mersey ferry Snowdrop a dazzle ship makeover entitled Everybody Razzle Dazzle. Sir Peter, who was born in Kent, said he hopes Liverpool people will accept him as an \"honorary Scouser.\" Lord Mayor of Liverpool Roz Gladden said: \"Sir Peter has helped shape Liverpool's cultural significance on the global stage for more than five decades - from Sgt Pepper to Everybody Razzle Dazzle. \"His work with The Beatles was one of the seminal moments in popular art in the 20th Century and 50 years on still resonates around the world as we will see with our 50 Summers of Love programme.\" She said he had continued to make outstanding contributions to the cultural life of the city \"underlining the depth of feeling he has for Liverpool and the city has for him.\" Sir Peter said: \"As well as my music links with the city, I'm proud of my association with Liverpool Biennial and Tate Liverpool and hope to continue my relationship with the city.\" He said he treasures \"the warmth and good humour of the people of Liverpool.\" Citizen of Honour awards were introduced in 2008 to recognise individuals who have enriched the image of Liverpool and its citizens. Recent recipients include James Barton, founder of the nightclub brand Cream, and Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts film director David Yates. The Snowdrop ferry was due to be returned to its original paintwork at the end of 2016 but it has been extended until 2019.",
        "Spending reviews - where the chancellor sets out how much each government department can spend for the next three or four years - were introduced by Gordon Brown in 1998. George Osborne held his first Spending Review in 2010. His second, which covered a single year, 201516, came in 2013. Wednesday's Spending Review will set departmental budgets for the next four years - up to the 2020 general election. Mr Osborne says he has now reached a settlement with all government departments. He has played down reports of rows with Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Home Secretary Theresa May, both of whom face big cuts in their budgets. Health, schools, international aid and defence will escape cuts but Mr Osborne has asked unprotected departments to find a total of PS20bn in savings as part of plans to balance the government's books. (The past spending cut figures are taken from the IFS analysis of the latest Treasury figures for changes to departmental expenditure limits between 201011 and 201516, taking into account the impact of inflation.) Cuts since 2010: 24.9 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: The police budget has been cut by 4 a year. About 17,000 frontline police jobs have been lost over the past five years, according to the Police Federation. What's next: In line for further sizeable cuts, with police chiefs warning that a cut of 25, at the bottom end of the expected range, could threaten the future of some forces. At least 22,000 jobs will be lost, according to unofficial estimates seen by The Guardian. Home Secretary Theresa May has suggested some forces could share resources. She has also been warned by one of the UK's most senior police officers that cuts on the scale expected could \"reduce very significantly\" the country's ability to respond to a Paris-style terrorist attack. George Osborne has said he is confident the UK would have the resources to respond to such a threat but made clear the police, like all public services, will have to make savings. Cuts since 2010: 13.5 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: Reductions in the size of the army and Royal Navy, delays to fighter jet upgrades, scrapping the Nimrod spy plane and halving the number of jets to be deployed on two new aircraft carriers. What's next: The chancellor pledged in his summer Budget to meet Nato's target of spending 2 of national income on defence every year, up to 2020. That means spending on defence will rise in real terms - 0.5 above inflation - every year during the Parliament. David Cameron has said this will mean a larger Navy, a larger RAF and a better-equipped Army, with an extra PS12bn over the next decade for new equipment and logistical support. The PS31bn predicted cost of four new Trident nuclear submarines, which is PS6bn higher than was estimated in 2010, is not included in these figures. Chancellor George Osborne is reportedly bidding to take control of that contract, for which there is also a PS10bn contingency fund, from the Ministry of Defence. The MoD will also be forced to sell off 30 of the land it owns and shed 30 of its civilian staff as part of PS11bn in efficiency savings. Cuts since 2010: 18.4 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: BiS was ordered to find 25 savings in George Osborne's first spending review in 2010, although in practice the cuts did not turn out to be as severe as that. The university teaching budget took a big hit and dozens of quangos were abolished. What's next: A likely target for further significant cuts. Business Secretary Sajid Javid has drawn up plans to close down some of its 80 offices and cut its remaining quangos by half to as few as 20, closing seven separate research councils, according to the Financial Times. Some 200 civil servants are taking voluntary redundancy, the paper says. Cuts since 2010: 34.1 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: Spending was slashed by 23 in 2010 and then by a further 10 in 2013, making an overall cut of PS2.1bn. This was largely achieved by cutting the number and cost of prison places. There are also plans to cut legal aid and close 91 courts and tribunals in England and Wales, and integrate or merge another 31. What's next: Justice Secretary Michael Gove has announced plans for nine new prisons, to be funded by selling off old prisons for housing. He will be expected to find significant further savings, which he has said he would like to achieve, in part, by reducing re-offending rates meaning fewer people returning to prison. The Chief Inspector of Prisons has warned about the dangers of overcrowding if the budget is cut further. Cuts since 2010: 21.6 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: More than half of the savings came from transferring the cost of the World Service to the BBC. There was also a reduction in the number of Whitehall based diplomats and a cut in capital spending. What's next: The Foreign Office has submitted proposals for budget cuts of between 25 and 40, according to the Financial Times. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond is said to be concerned about possible embassy closures. There have also been warnings about redundancies at Foreign Office HQ. However, the department is to boost funding to the World Service by PS34m in 2016-17, spending PS85m in each of the following three years. Cuts since 2010: 30.7 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: There were big cuts in administration costs and a 30 cut in the budget of Arts Council (England). What's next: Likely to be further cuts to arts funding with the National Lottery expected to make up shortfalls. Free museum entry likely to remain protected. Increase since 2010: 7.3 Where 2010-2015 increases went: Health is a protected department. The government pledged to increase funding for the NHS in England, in real terms, (which means the amount spent on it went up by more than the rate of inflation) every year between 2011 and 2015. The Department of Health says it met that pledge through a 5 real terms increase. At the same time the NHS has had to find billions in efficiency savings and the Department of Health was expected to save PS200m itself in 2015-6. What's next: George Osborne has set about fulfilling the Conservative manifesto pledge of increasing the funding for NHS England by PS8bn in real terms as demanded by the boss of NHS England Simon Stevens. By 2020-21 the total budget will be PS119.6bn, a rise of PS8.4bn once inflation is taken into account. The increases are front-loaded, with frontline NHS services getting a PS3.8bn, above-inflation cash injection next year. But details of what is happening to other areas of health spending, such as staff training budgets and the money held by councils to pay for public health schemes from stop smoking clinics to sexual health service, has not being released yet. Doubts also remain about what protection social care will get. The chancellor is understood to be considering allowing local authorities to increase council tax by 2 to pay for care. Cuts since 2010: 6.4 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: Schools budgets are protected but the rest of the department's spending is not - capital spending, on new buildings and equipment, has been cut, as has post-16 education and early years. Spending on the four-to-16-year-olds schools budget went up by 3 while cash spending per pupil rose by 6. What's next: The government has again vowed to protect cash spending per pupil although no details have been revealed. But experts say upward pressure on school budgets from growing pupil numbers and pay demands will mean a growing strain on resources. There had been questions about the free school meals for all infants policy, but David Cameron has ruled out that being axed. Increase since 2010: 24.1 Where 2010-2015 increases went: Justine Greening's international development department is protected from cuts and has seen its budget increase year-on-year, with most of the extra cash going to aid agencies rather than projects run by the UK government. What's next: The government will continue spending 0.7 of GDP on overseas aid in line with the UN target. although critics will be keeping an eye out for expenditure in other departments being re-categorised as international aid. In a change of policy, half of all Dfid's budget will be spent in \"fragile\" countries and regions, including the Middle East and South Asia, each year between 2016 and 2020. There will also be an extra PS300m a year for the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund by 2020 while funding for developing countries to deal with climate change will double over four years. Separate welfare and pensions budget: PS216bn Cuts since 2010: 35.8 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: More than PS21bn has been cut from the welfare budget. Controversial cuts to housing benefit, dubbed the \"bedroom tax\" by critics, and a PS26,000 cap on the total amount households can claim affected relatively small numbers of people. The biggest savings were achieved through cash freezes to child benefit and changes to how working age benefits are increased each year, as well as a 1 limit on most benefit rises. What's next: The Treasury is seeking a further PS12bn in cuts to welfare spending by 201819. It has now reached a deal with the Treasury, although the details have yet to be announced. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith appears to have seen off an attempt by the Treasury to make his department swallow the PS4bn cost of measures to ease the impact of cuts to tax credits. This would have been achieved by cutting work incentives offered through the new Universal Credit. Mr Duncan Smith is reported to have threatened to resign over the issue but sources say the dispute is now over. Budget increase since 2010: 14.3 Where 2010-2015 increases went: DECC is not a protected department so you would expect its budget to have been slashed. But 2013 measures to ease energy bill increases by adjusting green levies meant it went up overall during the last Parliament. There were also big investments in carbon capture and storage technology. What's next: DECC will not get such an easy ride this time. It has reached an agreement with the Treasury, expected to be around 21, although the full details have yet to be announced. The biggest chunk of its budget goes on nuclear decommissioning - and that can't be touched. So it can expect cuts of 46 in its other activities in 201718 before spending increases again, according analysis by the Green Alliance. Remaining budgets for green subsidies are likely to be in the firing line. It has already begun a job cuts programme, according to the Financial Times. Budget increase since 2010: 4.9 Where 2010-2015 increases went: The Cabinet Office was hit with a 33 core budget cut in the 2010 spending review, which it achieved through efficiency savings and a freeze on Royal Household spending. But the vast majority of its budget is taken up by the Security and Intelligence agencies, which have seen their budgets increase significantly in recent years. What's next: The Cabinet Office is something of a special case as it covers so many different functions across the whole of government, including driving through efficiency savings. It has now reached a spending deal with the Treasury. The details have yet to be revealed but Chancellor George Osborne has promised an extra PS1.9bn a year for cyber security as part of a 30 increase in the counter-terrorism budget. Cuts since 2010: 29.9 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: Defra was one of the biggest casualties of the 2010 spending review. The 2013 floods did change the picture slightly, with billions in extra capital investment in flood defences promised. But the department was still asked for find an extra PS83m in savings in 2015-6. What's next: Defra was one of the first departments to \"settle\" its funding with the Treasury. It is one of four departments to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30. How much of a hit Defra will take has yet to be revealed. But its capital funding has yet to be announced, with the Treasury pledging to back flood protection. Cuts since 2010: 13.4 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: Had to make cuts to running costs but big capital projects such as Crossrail and HS2 got the go-ahead. It was asked to find an extra PS545m in savings in 2015-6, the largest of any single department - the bulk coming from selling off land adjacent to King's Cross station. What's next: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured above, settled early with the Treasury. His department is one of four to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30. How much of a hit each department will take has yet to be revealed. But, again, capital spending is not included and the government says it wants to spend PS100bn on infrastructure upgrades over the period. Cuts since 2010: 51 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: DCLG took the biggest hit of any department, in percentage terms, in the last Parliament. The communities-focused part of its budget was cut in half and direct grants to local government fell by 27 in real terms between 2011 and 2015. A further PS230m in savings was sought in 2015-6 although the department said this did not affect any existing programs. What's next: Communities Secretary Greg Clark, pictured above, was one of the first cabinet ministers to settle with the Treasury. His department is one of four to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30. How much of a hit each department will take has yet to be revealed. And this figure does not include the revenue grant for town halls, which is determined on an annual basis. Cuts since 2010: 29.9 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: Capital spending was cut by 30 and savings made in other areas. What's next: Not surprisingly, given it is his department, George Osborne has already reached a deal with the Treasury. It is one of four to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30. How much of a hit each department will take has yet to be revealed. The Treasury also oversees HM Revenue and Customs, which means it will have to find a way of saving up to PS4bn to reduce the impact of tax credit cuts after the House of Lords rejected them. HMRC has reached an agreement with the Treasury on a cuts programme, which will see savings made through the \"digitisation\" of the tax system and the closure of \"low value\" programmes. Cuts since 2010: 8.5 The majority of public spending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is calculated using the Barnett formula - a system of grants allocated according to the population size of each nation and which powers are devolved to them. When the UK government increases or decreases funding for departments such as health and education in England, the Barnett formula is used to decide how much devolved governments will receive. Where the axe fell 2010-2015: The Scottish Barnett block grant fell PS1bn in cash terms between 200910 and 201112, from PS29.7bn to PS28.7bn. The grant is currently just below 201112 levels, in cash terms. What's next: The Scottish Office, Northern Ireland Office and Welsh Office have all reached a deal with the Treasury. The details have yet to be revealed but they are part of a package of cuts to seven departments that average 21 in total by 2020. The Scottish government has promised to protect health spending which could force ministers to make deeper cuts in other areas. But it will have more scope to raise additional revenue through the partial devolution of income tax and VAT, and the whole of Air Passenger Duty. The next block grant will be cut to compensate the UK government for tax revenues lost through the devolution of Stamp Duty land tax and landfill tax. Cuts since 2010: 8.7 Where the axe fell 2010-2015: Welsh government finance minister Jane Hutt says PS1.3bn has been \"taken out of vital public services\" over the past five years. What's next: Planned cash increases to NHS spending will be reflected in a funding boost for the NHS in Wales and this could offset other cuts. Non-devolved departmental spending in Wales will fall by approximately PS260m by 2018-19: this is a reduction of 16 in real terms, according to an analysis by The Institute for Welsh Affairs. Cuts since 2010: 8:8 Where the axe fell: Stormont's spending power was cut by more than PS1bn, in real terms, between 2010 and 2015, although health and schools spending was protected. What's next: The Northern Ireland executive expects a continued real-term decline in funding levels, mirroring the UK-wide squeeze. The Northern Ireland Office has reached a spending agreement with the Treasury. Presented by Chancellor George Osborne, the Spending Review sets out what government spending will be over the next four years, while the Autumn Statement is an annual update of government plans for the economy. Explained: Which government departments will be affected? Analysis: From BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Special report: Full in-depth coverage of the Spending Review and Autumn Statement Watch: The BBC's TV coverage begins on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel at 11:30 GMT, with BBC Radio 5 Live coverage from 11:55 GMT",
        "New research suggests that biodiversity around the globe will be significantly impacted if temperatures rise more than 2C. But the scientists say that the losses can be reduced if rapid action is taken to curb greenhouse gases. The paper is published in the journal, Nature Climate Change. An international team of researchers looked at the impacts of rising temperatures on nearly 50,000 common species of plants and animals. They looked at both temperature and rainfall records for the habitats that these species now live in and mapped the areas that would remain suitable for them under a number of different climate change scenarios. The scientists projected that if no significant efforts were made to limit greenhouse gas emissions, 2100 global temperatures would be 4C above pre-industrial levels. In this model, some 34 of animal species and 57 of plants would lose more than half of their current habitat ranges. According to Dr Rachel Warren from the University of East Anglia, this would have major impacts for everyone on the planet. \"Our research predicts that climate change will greatly reduce the diversity of even very common species found in most parts of the world. This loss of global-scale biodiversity would significantly impoverish the biosphere and the ecosystem services it provides,\" she said. \"There will also be a knock-on effect for humans because these species are important for things like water and air purification, flood control, nutrient cycling, and eco-tourism.\" The projected impacts on species will be felt more heavily in some parts of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, the Amazon region and Australia. However the researchers say that if global emissions of greenhouse gases are cut rapidly then the impact on biodiversity could be significantly curbed. If global emissions reach their peak in 2016 and temperature rises are held to 2C, then losses could be cut by 60. \"The good news is that our research provides new evidence of how swift action to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gases can prevent the biodiversity loss by reducing the amount of global warming to 2C rather than 4 degrees, said Dr Warren. \"This would also buy time - up to four decades - for plants and animals to adapt to the remaining 2 degrees of climate change.\"",

        "Speaking to BBC's Nolan Show, the 53-year-old entertainer from Donegal said nerves had impacted his performances. He said his anxiety was sometimes so bad he had struggled to walk down the stairs before the live show. Mr O'Donnell became the third celebrity to leave the competition at the weekend after failing to wow the judges in the dance off. He and Kristina Rihanoff faced sports presenter Kirsty Gallacher and Brendan Cole. But mistakes saw him being sent home. Mr O'Donnell and his partner performed the American Smooth to Frank Sinatra's Fly Me to the Moon, while Gallacher and Cole performed a Paso Doble to U2s Beautiful Day. Speaking on Saturday night's show, judge Craig Revel Horwood said: \"One couple did really, really well in the dance-off and one couple, I am afraid, made a lot of mistakes. \"I am going for the couple that was the most powerful, and that was Kirsty and Brendan.\" Mr O'Donnell told the Nolan Show that his nerves took him by surprise. \"If I didn't have to do that live show every Saturday night it would have been the perfect experience. \"The strange thing is I hadn't anticipated being nervous, I thought it would be hard to learn the routines, but I never anticipated that kind of nerves. \"I can't explain it. It's ridiculous from the point of view of someone who has been on stage as many times as me.\" He told the show he couldn't speak highly enough of the crew, dancers and judges on Strictly but said he was \"relieved\" to have been voted off. \"The dance off was a disaster.\" He said. \"I forgot everything and maybe I was quite happy to go to tell you the truth.\" Mr O'Donnell said he wouldn't be doing any more reality TV, but he would keep dancing.",

        "Media playback is not supported on this device Coe, 59, became boss of the body that governs world athletics last August after eight years as a vice-president. Since then, the IAAF has come in for heavy criticism, accused of helping cover up systematic doping in Russia. But Dick Pound, whose report damns IAAF governance, insists he \"can't think of anyone better\" than Coe to lead it. \"I think it's a fabulous responsibility for the IAAF to seize this opportunity and, under strong leadership, to move forward,\" said Pound, chairman of the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) panel which wrote the report. \"There's an enormous amount of reputational recovery that needs to occur here and I can't think of anyone better than Lord Coe to lead that.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Pound's 89-page report concluded that corruption within the IAAF \"cannot be blamed on a small number of miscreants.\" It was also particularly scathing of former IAAF president Lamine Diack, who stood down and was replaced by Coe after 16 years in charge. It concluded the Senegalese was \"responsible for organising and enabling the conspiracy and corruption that took place in the IAAF.\" The report also claimed the IAAF Council, which included Coe, \"could not have been unaware of the extent of doping in athletics.\" Coe, a former British MP, was present at Pound's news conference, having insisted on Wednesday there had been no cover-up. He also said he had no intention of standing down. Following the report's publication, Coe admitted: \"I know how serious this is. We are a failed organisation. \"I'm sorry if my language has in any way demonstrated a sort of a lack of understanding about the depth of this.\" He told BBC Sport that the IAAF - the International Association of Athletics Federations - would \"redouble our efforts, to be clear to people we are not in denial.\" And Coe re-emphasised: \"My responsibility is to absorb the lessons of the past and to shape the future. The changes I am making will do that. The road back to trust is going to be a long one.\" Diack is firmly in the line of fire. The report also concluded he: This section of the report is particularly scathing: \"The corruption that occurred within the IAAF was not at the level of some foreign currency trader in a bank carrying out unauthorised transactions, without the knowledge or permission of the responsible bank officers. \"Here it started with the president of the organisation. It involved the treasurer of the organisation. It involved the personal counsel of the president, acting on instructions of the president. It involved two of the sons of the president. It involved the director of the medical and anti-doping department of the IAAF. \"The corruption was embedded in the organisation. It cannot be ignored or dismissed as attributable to the odd renegade acting on his own. \"The IAAF allowed the conduct to occur and must accept its responsibility. Continued denial will simply make it more difficult to make genuine progress.\" BBC sports editor Dan Roan quizzed the former boss of Wada. Media playback is not supported on this device It was already reeling from a number of damaging revelations and was strongly criticised for its failure to tackle doping. In fact, it was only after Pound accused Russia of systematic doping practises in the first part of his report last November that the IAAF stepped in and banned Russian athletes from competition. Pound said: \"The commission has been troubled by the apparent unwillingness of the IAAF to acknowledge that the conduct does indeed reflect on the IAAF and that it must assume its responsibilities for what went wrong.\" Worse could follow for the IAAF, too. French police have issued a'wanted' notice via Interpol for Papa Massata Diack, the son of the former IAAF president Lamine, on charges of corruption and money-laundering. On the day of his election in August, Coe said suggestions his organisation was complicit in a doping scandal were \"just inaccurate.\" Thursday's allegations call into question that argument. They also add to the pressure on a man who has been a key figure within the IAAF since 2007, when he was made a vice-president. The report says Coe's right-hand man Nick Davies, who stepped aside from his position as the association's chief of staff last month, was \"well aware of Russian'skeletons' in the cupboard.\" Coe, who led London's successful staging of the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics, became IAAF president last year. In an IAAF statement hours after the report was published, it said it \"fully acknowledges and accepts the extreme gravity of the commission's findings.\" In the statement, Coe said he \"cannot change the past,\" but would \"not repeat its mistakes.\" Coe has again come out out fighting, as he did following part one of the Wada report - and he still has his backers. There's Pound, for a start, as well as Brendan Foster - the British former long-distance runner - who said his close friend was still the right man to lead the IAAF. \"He's hurting with all this,\" said the former British middle-distance runner, prior to Thursday's announcement. \"But Seb Coe is determined like no-one else can be determined. He's going to change this thing.\" Michele Verroken, the former head of anti-doping at UK Sport, is also backing Coe to lead the IAAF out of trouble. \"If not Seb, who?\" she asked. \"Quite honestly, he is very capable of doing this. It's a matter of whether he gets the support to do it.\" IAAF ambassador Kajsa Bergqvist, Sweden's world and European champion and an Olympic bronze medallist, said she met Diack 15 to 20 times and that he \"was always a person probably more interested in the power his office gave him than he was in the sport itself.\" Wada president Craig Reedie called the actions \"criminal\" and \"hugely disturbing,\" while sports minister Tracey Crouch said the findings of the report were \"extremely alarming.\" Former Great Britain athletes Roger Black and Kriss Akabusi both said there were no major surprises in the report, and backed Coe, as did marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe. She said: \"To single out Seb that he had an inclination of what was going on - I don't believe he did. I believe he had heard rumours, knew things needed to change, which is why put he put himself on the line and ran for presidency. \"If we attack and attack, then he might say'it is not worth it'. It is then athletics' loss.\" However, Akabusi described the IAAF president as \"naive\" for not being aware of the scale of Russian doping. \"He was a world-class athlete and he's going to need to be a world-class administrator and politician now,\" said Akabusi. Meanwhile, Russia sports minister Vitaly Mutko called the report \"absurd,\" claiming it was \"almost accusing\" the nation's president Vladimir Putin \"of doping.\" BBC Radio 5 live athletics correspondent Mike Costello: \"Lord Coe's reputation is on the line, especially with what he's been saying about Lamine Diack being the'spiritual leader' of the sport. \"Time after time he said there was no cover-up, but of course there was a cover-up, Wada chairman Dick Pound said today. \"There has to be some guilt by association for Coe. Yet within athletics there is a feeling that if not Seb Coe then who else?\" BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway: \"Athletics is still in a grip of a huge crisis and the report shows deep-rooted corruption within the IAAF. \"Lord Coe says he is the right man to lead the organisation but given the report said the ruling council, which Coe was a member of, could not have been unaware of doping problems, that is going to be a significant issue for him. \"Yet that backing from Wada chairman Dick Pound is crucial because without it Coe would be facing a tougher task to keep his role as IAAF president. \"Now he has a bit of political capital to take forward.\"",

        "Security minister James Brokenshire set out the motion, which was passed unopposed in the House of Commons on Thursday. It will now be an offence to be a member of any of the groups in the UK. Mr Brokenshire said terrorists from or connected to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq posed a threat to the UK security. The list of proscribed organisations includes ISIS, whose fighters are known to have been involved in conflicts in both countries. The four other groups to be banned are: Turkiye Halk Kurtulus Partisi-Cephesi (THKP-C); Kateeba al-Kawthar (KaK); Abdallah Azzam Brigades, including the Ziyad al-Jarrah Battalions (AABZJB); and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC). Mr Brokenshire said that Syria was the \"number one destination\" for jihadists anywhere in the world, and added that by banning these groups it sent a \"strong message that terrorist activity is not tolerated wherever it happens.\" He said: \"The reality is that the Syria conflict has seen a proliferation of terrorist groups with multiple aims and ideologies and little regard for international borders. For example in the last week we have seen significantly increased violent activity in Iraq by ISIS.\" Downing Street said on Wednesday that 65 people had been arrested in the past 18 months for Syria-related jihadist activities. And between 2001 and the end of March 2013, 32 people were charged with proscription offences as a primary offence in the UK, of which 16 were convicted. The motion was welcomed by Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who said more work needed to be done with internet service providers to ensure content related to the banned organisations was taken down. He said: \"We face our gravest threat in the last 13 years and the government is right to bring before the House a number of orders proscribing organisations which they feel undermine the security of this country.\"",

Vettel has since apologised for the incident. Media playback is not supported on this device Lewis Hamilton took third ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who obeyed an order to stay behind. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso crashed on the second lap after breaking his front wing. The Spaniard's team-mate Felipe Massa took fifth, fighting past the Lotus cars of Romain Grosjean and Kimi Raikkonen in the closing laps after the Lotus team's gamble to try to do only three pit stops rather than four failed. Grosjean finished sixth ahead of Raikkonen, who won the first race in Australia last weekend. McLaren's Jenson Button was on for a points-scoring finish, possibly in fifth place, before he was sent on his way from a pit stop with a loose front wheel. The Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg took eighth ahead of McLaren's Sergio Perez, with Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne 10th. It was a race full of drama as the intra-team battles at Red Bull and Mercedes played out live. \"The Malaysian Grand Prix team orders controversy at Red Bull is only the latest episode of a long-running drama between Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber. \"It goes right back to 2010, when the two crashed while Vettel tried to pass Webber for the lead of the Turkish Grand Prix. \"Since then, there has been a litany of further incidents at the team as the two men, both intensely determined and tough but very different in other ways, have battled for supremacy. \"Adding spice to it is Webber's belief that, while they profess to allow them to battle it out on the track, the team is more behind Vettel than him. \"The belief - widely shared within F1 - is founded on the way the team have responded to the various situations between their drivers. \"In their battle in Malaysia there may even have been a bit of residual revenge on Vettel's part - the German and his champion at Red Bull, motorsport chief Helmet Marko, felt Webber was obstructive in last season's title-deciding Brazilian Grand Prix.\" The battle between the Red Bulls was resolved in an intense scrap as Webber rejoined from his final pit stop. Vettel was warned by team boss Christian Horner that he was being \"silly\" but the two then battled wheel-to-wheel around Turns One and Two onto Turn Four, where Webber appeared finally to yield to his team-mate despite having the inside line. Webber said: \"After the last stop the team told me the race was over and we turned the engines down and go to the end. The team made their decision. Seb made his own decision and he will have protection as usual.\" Vettel was told over the radio after the race: \"Good job, Seb. Looks like you wanted it bad enough. Still you've got some explaining to do.\" Webber had initially taken the lead at the first stops as the drivers came in to fit dry-weather tyres following a wet start. He had led the race throughout, with the two Red Bull drivers using the two available tyre compounds in different orders. Vettel chose to end the race on the softer'medium' tyre while Webber was on the hard. Vettel said: \"Obviously it is very hot and if there is something to say we need to say it internally.\" Red Bull motorsport chief Helmut Marko, a powerful champion of Vettel, admitted the battle had \"got out of control.\" Meanwhile, there was controversy at Mercedes as Rosberg followed Hamilton closely in the final laps. Media playback is not supported on this device Rosberg asked the team to let him pass Hamilton, but was told \"negative\" by team boss Ross Brawn. When he complained again, Brawn told him that Hamilton - who had earlier been told to save fuel - was also being \"controlled\" and could also go faster. Hamilton admitted on the podium: \"I can't say it's the best feeling being up here today. If I'm honest I really feel Nico should be standing here.\" Hamilton had provided an amusing diversion when, coming in for his second stop, he headed into the pit box of former team McLaren before being waved on towards Mercedes. \"I did a Jenson,\" he said. \"He did it a couple of years ago and I've done it today. Apologies to my team.\" The result puts Vettel into the championship lead by 11 points from Raikkonen. Webber is five points further adrift and ahead of Hamilton, Massa and Alonso, who is already 22 points behind Vettel, the man who narrowly beat him to the title 2010 and 2012. Alonso started third and was up to second, past Massa, by the first corner. But he tapped the back of Vettel's car in Turn Two. It was the lightest of touches but enough to break the front wing mounts. He held onto second place throughout the first lap but did not stop to change it and it collapsed heading into Turn One on the second lap, sending him into the gravel trap. Ferrari said the decision not to stop was made in the pits. Alonso wrote later on Twitter: \"Bad luck today. As always over 19 races we will be compensated and we are ready to recover good points in the next race.\" Result: 1. Sebastian Vettel (Ger), Red Bull, 1hr 38min 56.681secs 2.

        "Reports say the couple were beaten to death by hundreds of locals who then burned their bodies in the brick kiln where they worked in Punjab province. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called the murders \"an unacceptable crime.\" Allegations of blasphemy are often used in Pakistan to settle personal scores or to target members of minorities. Police say the suspects are due to appear in court on Wednesday in Lahore. The victims have been identified as Shehzad Masih and his wife Shama. About 200 people in Lahore, mainly from the Christian community and human rights organisations, protested against the killings, which took place in the town of Kot Radha Kishan about 60km (40 miles) to the south-west. They held signs saying \"Christian carnage in the name of blasphemy should be stopped\" and \"the government has failed to give protection to minorities,\" BBC Urdu's Shumaila Jaffrey reports from Lahore. Union leader Farooq Tariq told the BBC that the dispute was actually over money. \"The owner of the brick kiln gave it a religious colour, and they locked up the Christian woman Shama for two days, then attacked her with shovels, then tortured her husband and threw them in the brick kiln. \"It's the worst misuse of religion,\" he said. In a statement, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said \"a responsible state cannot tolerate mob rule and public lynching with impunity.\" \"The Pakistani state has to act proactively to protect its minorities from violence and injustice.\" Pakistan's blasphemy laws carry a potential death sentence for anyone who insults Islam. Since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been found guilty of desecrating the Koran or of blasphemy. While most of them have been sentenced to death by the lower courts, many sentences have been overturned due to lack of evidence. However, correspondents say even the mere accusation of blasphemy, or defending someone accused of blasphemy, is enough to make someone a target for hardliners. In May gunmen in the city of Multan shot dead a lawyer, Rashid Rehman, who had been defending a university lecturer accused of blasphemy. Last month a Pakistani court upheld the death penalty for Asia Bibi, a Christian woman convicted of blasphemy in 2010 - a case which sparked a global outcry.",

He has only managed one century so far, but has looked comfortable and clinical after a consistent season which has brought him four ranking titles - including the UK Championship. Selby, aiming for a third world title, said his good form meant he is not being troubled by the weight of expectation that comes with being the current champion. \"I don't feel under pressure as much, but I suppose that's because of the season I have had,\" the 33-year-old added. \"If I had come here not having won anything and struggling for form, it would have been a bit different with the defending champion tag on my back. \"But that's not the case.

        "It has led to calls for Douglas Ross to stand down from his frontbench role as the party's justice spokesman. He was an assistant referee at the clash between Sporting Lisbon and Real Madrid on Tuesday. But it meant he was unable to attend a justice committee meeting in the Scottish Parliament. Mr Ross earns up to PS40,000 a year as a self-employed specialist assistant football referee, according to his Scottish Parliament register of interests. He is also a councillor with Moray Council and his trip to Portugal meant he missed its policy and resources committee meeting on Tuesday. SNP MSP Ben Macpherson said it was not the first time Mr Ross's refereeing job had affected his parliamentary work. It has been reported that he missed a key vote in parliament when he was in Switzerland taking part in World Cup referee training. Mr Macpherson said: \"The arrogance and blatant disrespect of'three jobs' Tory Douglas Ross is simply staggering. \"Last time the whistle was blown on one of his refereeing junkets the Tories claimed it was just a'one off'. But he's at it again - and this time it should be a straight red card. \"Obviously he values his PS40k-a-year weekend job - and all-expenses paid trips to Lisbon and other European cities - more than his responsibilities as an MSP and local councillor, demonstrating complete contempt for the people who elected him. \"If Douglas Ross can't pitch up to do his job, it's time for relegation - he should either take a step back from refereeing or stand down from Holyrood's justice committee with immediate effect, and Ruth Davidson should give him the boot from her frontbench team.\" A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: \"Earlier this year Ben Macpherson asked Douglas to kindly speak to clubs in his constituency about refereeing - presumably this invitation has now been rescinded.\" Mr Ross did not comment.",

        "Markets run by federal and state governments opened for the millions of Americans seeking insurance plans. As many as seven million Americans who do not already have health insurance are eligible to purchase coverage in the coming months. Republican opposition to the law led to the government shutdown on Tuesday. At the White House on Tuesday, Mr Obama said the opportunity would be \"life changing\" for the \"15 of Americans who don't have health insurance.\" \"Tens of thousands of Americans die each year just because they don't have health insurance,\" Mr Obama said, with Americans set to sign up for plans standing behind him. \"Millions more live with the fear that they'll go broke if they get sick. And today, we begin to free millions of our fellow Americans from that fear.\" While Mr Obama and his supporters in the Democratic Party portray the law as a historic effort to extend healthcare coverage to the millions of Americans who lack it, the law's opponents say it amounts to an unprecedented intrusion into Americans' private lives. The online health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, struggled to meet higher than expected demand on Tuesday, with many users reporting long waiting times. Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters told the Associated Press news agency the agency was \"prepared to make adjustments as needed [to] improve the consumer experience.\" Users also reported errors while trying to create accounts and site crashes on the websites. \"The first day of something that you know is going to have a lot of bugs, it's not that frustrating,\" Mike Weaver, a self-employed photographer without insurance told the Associated Press. \"If it was the last day to sign up.... then I'd be terribly frustrated.\" Mr Obama acknowledged the glitches and delays. \"We found out that there have been times this morning where the site has been running more slowly than it normally will,\" Mr Obama said. \"The reason is because more than one million people visited healthcare.gov before 7:00 in the morning.\" The exchanges will continue to enrol people through the end of the year for healthcare plans slated to begin next year. The opening of the exchanges was the culmination of more than three years of political combat in Washington over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by Mr Obama in 2010 and known to both sides as Obamacare. Republicans in Washington and in state capitals across the country have fought hard to undermine or undo the law since its passage, with the US House of Representatives taking dozens of symbolic votes to repeal it or eliminate its funding. A legal challenge led by the law's Republican opponents ended in June 2012 when the Supreme Court validated the law's keystone provision - a requirement that Americans not receiving health coverage from their employers or the government purchase individual plans or pay a fine. That requirement, known as the individual mandate, takes effect in January. The healthcare law was also a central issue in the 2012 presidential election. Republican candidate Mitt Romney vowed to press for its repeal. Mr Obama handily won re-election. On Tuesday, the US government shut non-essential services, keeping more than 700,000 workers at home, when the Democrats who control the Senate refused to agree to Republican demands to repeal the health law or delay the individual mandate. Both Mr Obama and congressional Democrats have said they will not negotiate on Obamacare, with Mr Obama on Monday evening accusing the Republicans of attempting to refight the last election. In spite of the political turmoil in Washington, on Tuesday Americans were able to enrol in insurance plans offered by private companies and ranging in price and level of coverage through exchanges in every state. Sixteen states and Washington DC have opted to operate their own exchanges, while the exchanges in 34 states will be fully or partially run by the federal government. Exchanges will also inform customers of tax subsidies available to ease the cost of the insurance. An estimated six million US citizens are expected to qualify. Customers enrolling under Obamacare will not be covered by the insurance until 1 January however. That corresponds with the start of the individual mandate, as well as consumer protections including a rule barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions. Several Obamacare provisions had taken effect prior to Tuesday, including prescription drug discounts for pensioners, a rule allowing children to remain on their parents' insurance plans up to age 26, a rule barring insurers from denying coverage to children with pre-existing health conditions, and a ban on lifetime limits on health coverage. Another major provision known as the employer mandate - which requires employers with at least 50 full-time workers to provide insurance or incur a 2,000 (PS1,320) per employee penalty - has been delayed until 2015. That delay, announced by the Obama administration in July, has been seen as a concession to retailers and other businesses - and an acknowledgement that the health law was not fully ready for implementation.",

        "Lee Gaskell grabbed the game's first try after 22 minutes, with Danny Brough adding the extras and a later penalty to make it 8-0 at half-time. Ukuma Ta'ai's touchdown for the hosts was followed by Gaskell's second as Huddersfield built a 20-point lead. Josh Drinkwater got Leigh's only try before Leroy Cudjoe completed the win. Huddersfield's triumph, their second in as many weeks over the competition's bottom two sides, confirms the make up of the Super 8s and Qualifiers. Warrington, who won the League Leaders' Shield last season and lost both major finals in 2016, are resigned to having to battle to avoid relegation. Leigh, whose captain Micky Higham made his 500th career appearance in the defeat, need to beat near neighbours Salford next week and hope that Widnes fail to overcome Warrington if they are to avoid finishing bottom after 23 Super League games. Huddersfield Giants boss Rick Stone: \"It was a tough, physical game and we showed some good resilience. \"Our goal is now to win as many games as we can and we have a few boys to come back from injury.\" On confirming a top eight finish: \"I was always confident as most of the time we were a bit banged up with injuries and I felt once we got those players back it would help us. \"It started probably at the Magic Weekend with a bit of a rusty win over Catalans. We began to respect the process a bit more - the boys have bought into that and the last couple of months have been good.\" Leigh Centurions coach Neil Jukes: \"I thought we turned up for one another and had a real dig, but there were just too many silly scenarios which kept putting unforced pressure on ourselves. \"While the scoreline doesn't look great, to do the amount of defending we did shows that there's still a good work ethic within them.

        "My sources include collectors all over the world, dealers, auctions, flea markets, and just about any place I can think of. The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell,\" features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.",
        "The Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights said budget cuts cannot be used as an excuse for not upholding the rule of law. More than 300 people were killed by the security forces in Northern Ireland. Nils Muiznieks said the government is currently breaching the European Convention of Human Rights. He said they were doing so by not conducting effective, independent and reasonably prompt investigations into the killings. \"Article two, the right to life, is one of the core rights,\" he told the BBC. \"It involves not only the state's responsibility to protect people from unlawful death, but also the responsibility to investigate effectively the circumstances of the death and punish those responsible. It is an absolute obligation.\" As one of 47 members of the Council of Europe, the UK has signed up to the Convention on Human Rights. The European Court has previously ruled that the British government had failed to comply with its legal obligations. In response, the government put forward a package of measures it said fulfilled its legal duties. The government points to the work of the Historical Enquiries Team, the office of the Police Ombudsman and inquests in Coroner's courts as evidence of its commitment to investigating the past. However, critics and campaign groups say, that in reality, the investigation into killings by soldiers and police officers has virtually ground to a halt. The HET has ceased conducting investigations and will cease to exist from the end of the year. Investigations by the police ombudsman into some highly controversial killings have been delayed because of budget cuts. A lack of resources has also led to long delays in inquests. \"I'm concerned. I think far too long a period has passed before people have received justice and information about the fate of their loved ones and about the fate of these cases,\" Mr Muiznieks said. \"It is clear that budgetary cuts should not be used as an excuse to hamper the work of those working for justice. Westminster cannot say'well we will let the Northern Irish Assembly deal with this, this is under their jurisdiction'. \"The UK government cannot wash its hands of the investigations, including funding of the investigations. These are the most serious human rights violations. \"Until now there has been virtual impunity for the state actors involved and I think the government has a responsibility to uphold its obligations under the European Convention to fund investigations and to get the results. \"The issue of impunity is a very, very serious one and the UK government has a responsibility to uphold the rule of law. This is not just an issue of dealing with the past, it has to do with upholding the law in general.\" In a statement released on Thursday, a Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said the UK government has a \"strong track record in upholding human rights, and takes its human rights obligations extremely seriously.\" \"We are working assiduously on a range of processes under way which relate to Northern Ireland's past, including very extensive disclosure exercises,\" the statement added. \"Developing a fresh approach to Northern Ireland's troubled past remains an issue that needs to be resolved as part of Northern Ireland's peace and political process. \"The government is currently engaged in intensive talks with Northern Ireland's political leaders and the Irish government on a range of matters including how to approach the legacy of the past. The Secretary of State believes that these talks provide a crucial opportunity to address this pressing issue.\" The commissioner was in Belfast to make the keynote address at a conference organised by the Ulster University. Other speakers included Attorney General John Larkin QC and Police Ombudsman Dr Michael Maguire. Campaign groups and lawyers will scrutinise the commissioner's comments closely. There has been much talk in recent months about the impact of budget cuts on dealing with the past. It has been said that policing the present has to take precedence over policing the past. Mr Muiznieks's comments may make it more likely that that approach will be challenged in the European Court.",

The 23-year-old joined record-breaking Sir Bradley Wiggins, Steven Burke and Ed Clancy to beat the world champions. \"That was just surreal, it feels dreamlike\" said the Cardiff rider. Media playback is not supported on this device \"We've been in situations like that before when we've been so close and have lost so to pull it off now is unbelievable.\" He had previously won silver medals at the 2015 and 2016 World Championship - this year to the Australian team - but Doull earned Olympic redemption to add to the four Welsh silver medallists in Rio. \"I've dreamt of this moment for so long,\" added Doull. \"It's what gets you out of the bed in the morning. I've pictured crossing that line first and winning the Olympics and to finally be here and do it, it's just surreal. It's a culmination of four years of hard work.\" Swimmer Jazz Carlin, rower Victoria Thornley and rugby sevens players Sam Cross and James Davies had already enjoyed podium finishes before Doull secured Wales' seventh gold in the last three Olympics. Wales had not won an Olympic title in 36 years when Nicole Cooke stormed to women's road race gold in 2008 - the first Welsh cycling medal ever at an Olympics. But since Cooke's win in Beijing, Wales have won three more cycling gold medals - and could win a fifth on Saturday when Elinor Barker will help the British world record holding women bid for team pursuit gold. Doull - who started cycling at the Maindy Fliers club in Cardiff like Thomas and Barker - had helped the Great Britain team to lower the world record in their heat demolition of New Zealand. But Team GB were quickly behind in Friday's final as Australia led by 0.7 seconds at the halfway mark, before GB reeled them in and then pulled away in the final 500m to win the 4km race by 0.83 seconds - in a world record time of three minutes, 50.265 seconds. Doull's team-mate Wiggins became the first Briton to win eight Olympic medals - five golds, one silver and two bronzes - as GB won a third successive team pursuit Olympic title. \"It gives you such confidence....you've got Brad on my right behind me and I've got Burke and Ed down below me,\" said Doull. \"It's Burke's second Olympic title in his discipline, it's Ed's third and he's the most decorated Yorkshireman, so he keeps telling me, so to have that calibre of team is just massive and it gives you such confidence.\"",

Her Grade II listed childhood home, Red Barns, in Redcar, has since been a pub and hotel and is now empty. Redcar Labour MP Anna Turley is seeking help to save the building and use it as a museum, learning centre and tourist attraction. \"Red Barns has huge significance to the local area and it is tragic that such a beautiful building with so much history has deteriorated into such a poor state,\" she said. The current owners have planning permission to convert the building into flats, but are \"sympathetic to the building's relevance to the community,\" she said. The manager of Bell's photographic archive at Newcastle University, Dr Mark Jackson, said it was \"desperately sad\" her home had fallen into disrepair. The house was designed by renowned Arts and Crafts movement architect, Philip Webb, and the interiors were by designer and artist William Morris \"so it's an architecturally important building,\" he added. Bell left a \"fantastic record\" of buildings and communities long since destroyed, including 50 photographs of Palmyra in 1900, much of which has been destroyed by so-called Islamic State, Dr Jackson said.

GB now begin their Eurobasket qualifying campaign with a game in Hungary in midweek. \"The key to the qualifiers will be completing on every play. We have to make sure that we're going as hard as we can on both ends of the floor,\" Prunty told BBC Sport. \"I think at times tonight we lost a little of our fire.\" Prunty turned to his strongest line-up in the final warm-up match before he cuts the roster for the six-game qualifying programme. GB led 35-24 on Lawrence's three in the second quarter but the Dutch took the lead early in the third. Gordon then hit three threes in a row - his first points of the game - to restore GB's advantage. Netherlands, who were led by 18 points from Worthy De Jong, scored the first 10 points of the fourth quarter to lead 71-60 and held on to win despite the hosts' comeback in the last six minutes.

        "The convoy was heading through northern Paris on its way to Le Bourget airport late on Sunday evening when it was raided, reports say. The gunmen seized a vehicle carrying the money and documents, later releasing the driver and two others. The convoy was said to have come from the Saudi embassy. No-one was hurt. The gunmen, reportedly armed with Kalashnikov rifles, targeted a Mercedes mini-van at 21:15 (19:15 GMT) on the northern ring road, or peripherique, at Porte de la Chapelle, on the edge of Paris. The motorcade, belonging to a Saudi prince, was ambushed by eight people in two separate vehicles who pointed their guns at the driver of the Mercedes, forcing him to stop, French media reported. The men then drove the vehicle away with the driver and the two other Saudis inside. No shots were fired but the Saudis were later freed. \"In the vehicle there was roughly 250,000 euros in cash and official documents from the embassy,\" police union spokesman Rocco Contento told BFM TV news. According to Contento, the operation lasted just a few seconds, something that pointed to \"a very organised and especially informed commando unit, who had information and accomplices.\" \"As far as I am concerned, it looks very much like it could be commandos from eastern Europe, who we know about, who are often paid to do dirty work.\" The Mercedes was heading to Le Bourget airport with paperwork for the departing prince, who has not been named, according to the prosecutor's office.

        "Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) called for urgent government action as it revealed a 47 increase in food bank inquiries on its services. It said it provided advice on emergency food providers 7,400 times in 201415. The UK government said the report failed to recognise that poverty in Scotland was at a record low. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said it spends PS90bn a year on working-age benefits to help the most vulnerable in society. The food bank statistics emerged in a new report - Living at the Sharp End - in which CAS researchers investigated the root cause of the trend. The report revealed clients often arrived at citizens' advice bureaux hungry, having not eaten for days, and with no money for essentials. A total of 71 told researchers they cut down on food when they were faced with a gap in their income. The report also found the service was increasingly seeing people who had exhausted all forms of government support and whose only option was to go to a food bank. The Scottish government is set to gain control of some aspects of welfare in September. Scottish Secretary David Mundell is expected to sign off the transfer and timetable later this week. The report's findings included a profile of the CAS clients who sought advice about food banks. It found that: CAS head of policy and public affairs Susan McPhee, called for urgent government action to prevent people slipping through the safety net of social security. \"When reports like this have been published in the past, the standard reaction of the UK government has been to say that there is a support network in place that prevents people falling into destitution,\" she said. \"Our evidence today shows beyond dispute that this is simply not the case. \"If it were, there would be no need for food banks at all, yet Scottish CABs had to give food bank advice over 7,000 times last year, and our report shows that too many Scottish families are struggling in severe poverty.\" The report found changes to the benefits system, low pay, insecure work and the rising cost of living contributed to their clients' money problems. It also discovered that benefits problems - including administrative errors and sanctions - forced people to seek crisis support. The report makes a series of recommendations designed to increase people's resilience to \"income shocks,\" prevent gaps in income and improve crisis assistance. Ms McPhee said: \"As our new prime minister takes office, this report makes clear that the social security system is simply not working for the most vulnerable people in our society. \"We make a number of recommendations in our report about how to improve this, and we want to work with both governments to make those changes happen. \"But it is clear that action is needed now.\" The DWP said the report failed to take into account the latest statistics on poverty in Scotland. A spokeswoman said: \"Work is the best route out of poverty and since 2010 there are 140,000 more people in work in Scotland. \"We're also continuing to spend around PS90bn a year on working-age benefits, supporting the most vulnerable in society.\"",

        "The Nobel committee praised him for a peace deal signed with Farc rebels, but rejected by Colombians in a vote. Mr Santos said he dedicated the award to \"all the victims of the conflict,\" and the Farc leader congratulated him. About 260,000 people have been killed and more than six million internally displaced in Colombia. The award did not include Farc leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, who also signed the accord. The head of the Nobel commitee said the award recognised the president's \"resolute efforts\" to end the conflict. \"The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the parties who have contributed to the peace process,\" Kaci Kullman Five added. Sources: BBC Monitoring, Colombian presidency Mr Santos said on Twitter: \"This honourable distinction is not for me, it's for all the victims of the conflict. Together we'll win the most important award of them all: peace.\" The peace deal was rejected by 50.2 of voters who went to the polls on 2 October. The committee acknowledged the result, saying: \"What the'No' side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement.\" It also said that finding a balance between the need for reconciliation and ensuring justice for the victims would be a difficult challenge. Also on Twitter, Farc leader Timochenko said: \"I congratulate President Juan Manuel Santos, Cuba and Norway, who sponsored the process, and Venezuela and Chile, who assisted it, without them, peace would be impossible.\" Earlier, he had written: \"The only prize we aspire to is peace with social justice for Colombia, without (right-wing) paramilitary groups, without retaliation or lies. Peace in the streets.\" This was a Peace Prize for a peace deal that wasn't. President Santos joins a long line of Nobel Peace Prize winners who have been rewarded for effort as much as achievement. But it is too easy to be cynical. The Nobel Peace Prize has often been controversial. In recent years a variety of international bureaucracies have won - the EU, the IAEA and the OPCW. Why, some have argued, should people get a prize for simply doing their job? What, others ask, had US President Barack Obama actually done to merit the prize in 2009, other than be elected? But the Nobel has often gone to extraordinary individuals who really have gone above and beyond to bring peace - in Northern Ireland and East Timor to name just two examples. Maybe the award to President Santos may yet galvanise public opinion in Colombia to think again about the deal. Critics, led by former president Alvaro Uribe, said the deal was too lenient to the rebels. Under the agreement, special courts would have been created to try crimes committed during the conflict. Those who confessed would have received lighter sentences and avoided serving any time in conventional prisons. The Farc would also have been guaranteed 10 seats in the Colombian Congress in the 2018 and 2022 elections. Despite the rejection by voters, Mr Santos vowed to continue with talks with the rebels. Government negotiators have already returned to the Cuban capital Havana for further discussions with Farc leaders. Kaci Kullman Five, from the Nobel committee, said the award was also meant as \"encouragement\" to the rebels. \"Giving the prize to Santos is not a belittlement to any of the other parties. \"The Farc is obviously a very important part of this process.\" 1964: Set up as armed wing of Communist Party 2002: At its height, it had an army of 20,000 fighters controlling up to a third of the country.

The UN has appealed for 415m (PS270m) to help provide emergency relief over the next three months. Meanwhile, a teenage boy has been rescued alive after spending five days trapped under rubble in Kathmandu. Crowds cheered as the boy was brought blinking into the daylight, a BBC reporter at the scene says. Officials say Saturday's quake killed more than 5,500 people, and injured at least 11,000. The UN says more than eight million people have been affected by Saturday's 7.8-magnitude quake and some 70,000 houses have been destroyed. The government says it has been overwhelmed by the disaster. In several villages north-east of the capital, Kathmandu, no buildings have been left untouched and bodies are still lying under the rubble, the BBC's Richard Galpin reports. There has been no help from the government or aid agencies even though supplies could easily be brought in by road or by helicopter, he says. \"We will die if there is no help from the government or other organisations,\" Dhan Bahadur Shresta, a resident of Deupur Sipaghat Kavre village, told our correspondent. \"We will starve to death and could get diseases like cholera and dysentery and there could be an epidemic.\" Some helicopter crews who have managed to land in isolated communities have been faced with desperate villagers pleading to be airlifted to safety. In the village of Sangachowk, angry villagers blocked the main road with tyres and stopped trucks of rice and other aid headed for other areas, Reuters news agency reported. The villagers also reportedly blocked a convoy of army trucks loaded with relief supplies, leading to a tense standoff with armed soldiers. How long can people survive under rubble?

There were more angry scenes in Dolakha, east of Kathmandu, when residents smashed the windows of a local administrative building, Chief District Officer Prem Lal Lamichhane said. \"Over 200,000 people are homeless. We've been told that materials are on their way, but we haven't received them yet,\" he added. Despite extensive damage, experts say the number of casualties in many villages was lower than feared because people were working outdoors at the time the quake struck. In Kathmandu, riot police clashed on Wednesday with protesters angry at a lack of transport out of the city and delays in distributing aid. Thousands were waiting for buses to take them to rural areas. \"We've been left starving in the cold and the best this government can give us is this queue,\" said one resident, Rajana, as she queued for a bus to her home village. Witnesses said a truck carrying drinking water was forced off the road and protesters climbed on top of it, throwing the bottles into the crowd. Columns of riot police stood behind rolls of razor wire as protesters surged into the street. However, there have been some signs that parts of the capital are returning to normal. Some people have decided to return to their homes, having spent several nights in the open. Cash machines have been refilled and some shops and street vendors have once again started trading.",

        "The girl, called Nieve, was attending the Handmade Parade in Hebden Bridge on Sunday with her grandparents when the dog jumped up and bit her. She needed eyelid surgery and suffered \"potentially irreparable damage\" to a tear duct. The man in the e-fit is described as being broad, bald and aged about 50. A second man, also thought to be about 50 and of similar build, was present at the time of the incident, West Yorkshire Police said. Both men left the scene without checking on the girl's welfare or leaving any details. The dog, believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier, was on a lead at the time of the incident and is described as brindle and white coloured. PCSO Gareth Helliwell said: \"The five-year-old girl involved in this incident needed reconstructive surgery to an eyelid following this attack and has suffered potentially irreparable damage to her lower tear duct.\" The girl's family described the dog's owner as \"scum,\" adding \"she could have lost her eye, she was covered in blood and the guy just ran off, it's cowardly.\" She was also bitten on the ankle despite the dog being pulled away on a lead, they said. Police appealed for anyone with information about the dog or the two men with it to contact them.",
        "College baseball player Christopher Lane, 22, was shot in the back in the town of Duncan on Friday. Police said one of the accused admitted Lane was killed for \"the fun of it.\" Chancey Luna, 16, and James Edwards, 15, were charged with first-degree murder; Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, has been named as accessory to the crime. Lane, from Melbourne, had been visiting his girlfriend's family in Duncan. He was entering his final year at East Central University in the city of Ada, some 85 miles (137km) east of the town. Because of the severity of their alleged crime, all three of the accused will be tried in adult court. At Tuesday's hearing, Michael Dewayne Jones cried after he tried to speak about the incident but was cut short by the judge, who said the facts of the case would be determined at another hearing. Bail for him was set at 1m (PS640,000). The two younger accused were denied bail. Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford told local television on Monday that one suspect had said Lane was killed at random. \"They saw Christopher go by, and one of them said,'there's our target, Chief Ford said. \"The boy who has talked to us said,'we were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody. Mr Ford said they followed Lane in a car and shot him once in the back before driving off. Witnesses rushed to help Lane after seeing him collapse on the road in Duncan, which has about 24,000 residents. Family and friends in the US and Australia have been mourning him. His American girlfriend, Sarah Harper, wept as she laid a cross by a memorial in Duncan at the spot where he was shot. Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper reported that roses and a baseball were placed on the home plate where Lane played baseball as a boy in a suburb of the city. It was accompanied by a message that read: \"A wonderful young man taken too soon. Why?\" The victim's father, Peter Lane, said there was no explanation for his son's death. \"It is heartless and to try to understand it is a short way to insanity,\" he told Australia's Sky News. The mother of one of the accused was quoted by Australian broadcaster ABC News as saying that she could not believe her son was at fault. \"I get off work at three,\" she said. \"It takes me five minutes to get home and he was there. That's what time they said it happened.\"",
        "St Helens Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) in Merseyside could suspend all non-essential hospital referrals for four months during the winter. The CCG's lay chair, Geoffrey Appleton, said the group recognises the move \"won't be popular\" but is facing a funding gap of PS12.5m this year. The British Medical Association (BMA) called the move \"unacceptable.\" The CCG, which was recently rated \"inadequate\" by NHS England, is also suggesting a two-year suspension of IVF services for people aged under 37 and stopping provision of gluten free foods and some over-the-counter medicines. Mr Appleton said the plan would \"support hospitals during the busy winter period\" and allow them to concentrate on the sickest patients. Explaining the group's situation in its Financial Recovery Plan, he said: \"Imagine our NHS budget is your household budget and every year the cost of living goes up but your salary doesn't increase; the result is money becomes tighter and tighter.\" \"Now imagine another relative comes to live with you and because of their health needs are unable to work and cannot contribute financially. How would you manage?\" Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chair of the BMA's GP committee, said the move \"highlights the incredible financial pressure facing general practice and its impact on patient care. \"It cannot be right that the public will be effectively denied access to healthcare because the local CCG has run out of money,\" he said. He called on government ministers to \"step up their commitment to resolving this crisis.\" \"The cost to the health service of delaying referrals could ultimately be much greater in the long term as more complex and costly problems develop as a result.\" The CCG says it is \"under-funded\" compared with other areas in Cheshire and Merseyside. An NHS spokeswoman said deciding how to prioritise resources are \"very difficult for commissioners\" but CCGs must \"plan and manage demand over winter.\" \"St Helens CCG is actively engaging with its local population on the best way to ensure patients have their care prioritised over the busy months for the NHS,\" she said. Charity Coeliac UK criticised plans to cut gluten-free prescriptions, saying it \"will leave vulnerable patients without support\" and \"could cost the NHS more in the long run.\" The NHS England regional office will review the proposals before a decision is made because of the CCG's inadequate rating. The proposals are under public consultation until 5 October.",
        "A report said the force was inadequate at protecting vulnerable victims. Surrey Police boss Nick Ephgrave said the force was good at preventing crime but this potentially came at the expense of investigations. Inspector Zoe Billingham said Surrey showed a \"commendably strong commitment to keeping people safe from harm.\" She said the force had strong, mature neighbourhood police teams who worked well with councils, and neighbourhood officers had more training than in other forces. But she said: \"The way the force investigates more complex crime requiring specialist investigations is still not good enough. \"Many investigations that we reviewed were not of an acceptable standard and there were long delays in examining computers and mobile phones for evidence.\" She said the force needed to improve its understanding of the threat posed by organised crime, improve its process for mapping those groups, and fully mobilise its neighbourhood teams in the fight against organised crime. Mr Ephgrave, temporary chief constable, said the force was already tackling concerns by increasing resources to protect the vulnerable, and providing more training, better process and use of systems, and a culture change in how the force operated. He said: \"None of these things can provide an instant fix but together they are starting to deliver positive results.\" A separate report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) in December last year found Surrey Police's approach to protecting vulnerable people to be inadequate. Surrey police and crime commissioner Kevin Hurley said changes were already in place, including a change in chief constable. This month it emerged that Mr Hurley had considered seeking Ms Owens' dismissal as Surrey Police chief. She resigned last autumn to move to her new role as director general of the National Crime Agency Mr Hurley said: \"When we look at where the buck stops, it stays with the team manager.\" But he said the force was already turning around, with reductions in robbery and burglary, improvements in violent crime and rape investigations, praise for the force's action on anti-social behaviour. The BBC has approached Ms Owens for a comment. In a previous response, she said blame apportioned to her was \"ill-considered and inaccurate.\" \"I was selected to my current role by the Home Secretary after a lengthy and thorough process and am now focused on leading the National Crime Agency in its fight to cut serious and organised crime,\" she said.",

        "Her praise of menstrual leave - and suggestion that all women should be offered it - prompted a fiery debate among readers. Here is a selection of your experiences and opinions about the idea. How can we say we want equality over pay and employment and then ask for a day's extra'holiday' per month just for being a female? That's not asking for equality, that's saying women aren't as able to work as men, which surely kills all argument for equality.... Guess what, I'm a female who has a period every month and I am still able to work as well as any man! If some women can't then that's their problem and they need to see a doctor! Charlotte Rachael, Halifax, UK Personally, I suffer, for up to two weeks straight, I suffer. I've passed out through temporary anaemia at work. I've had to stop walking and hold on to a wall or a fence when walking to work. But I don't consider it necessary to call in sick, nor do I believe additional leave days should be required.... We don't need additional leave, those who are suffering so badly need to push with their GPs to see a specialist. To award additional days leaves companies open to being taken advantage of by women who aren't suffering and just don't want to go to work for whatever reason. Lyndsey Victoria Corp, Barnsley, UK Unfortunately, this is exactly why women make less money. Okay, well.... it contributes. We are just gonna have to \"man up\" if we expect equality. Valerie Richardson, Oregon, US The idea [of menstrual leave] makes sense to a degree, but surely unpaid leave will increase the wage gap (fewer hours means lower wages), which many people seem to take issue with. If it were to be paid leave, people who take the leave will either have to work harder to make up the time, or an earnings gap will develop, which is a much bigger problem than a wage gap, since fewer hours worked and equal wages means more money per hour worked for the same job, which is normally illegal. Obviously time off because of pain isn't a holiday, but it's simply not providing value to the company. I guess another alternative would be government subsidy, but I'm generally against too much of that in principle. Alex, Dundee, UK I do sympathise with women who have a genuine problem. I'm a woman, I've been head chef in many kitchens, and don't think that I've never had to sneak into the walk-on fridge to cool down for two minutes because I might pass out. I have the same problems, I have the same pains. The difference is, I don't want to be taken the piss out of on an already male dominant role when I have worked so hard to overtake the next Gordon Ramsey chewing at my ankles! I am a reliable worker and I'm not about to be dropped at interviews \"just in case\" I can't give 100 every day. I HAVE spent 15 years in kitchens \"manning up.\" Because whether you like it or not, the working world is NOT equal, never has been, probably never will be. And I'm happy working that bit harder than the men to prove myself. Jordan Glasspool Hewitt, Cornwall, UK 'Good idea'! Those who thought menstrual leave should be offered I won't lie, I used to think women should just get on with it, not that we had the choice anyway. But after a miscarriage, on the first day of every period I'm crippled with constant back and pelvic pain, and mini contractions. I can barely walk it's so bad. I haven't taken time off work, but it definitely affects my work performance. Strong painkillers just leave me fatigued and confused. Now I'm more understanding. For some women, especially those with gynaecological problems, it can be debilitating. Unless someone has been in that position, they can't understand how bad it is for some women. Stacey Robertson, West Lothian, UK There should be extra measures in place for those days. Also, some countries or companies don't offer as many sick days as others. This has nothing to do with gender equality. It's called being humane. Just because our grandmothers and mothers didn't have rights or privileges for their menstrual days, doesn't mean that we shouldn't benefit from societal advances and modern understanding! Marsha Thompson, New York, US BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.

I had to be carried to the doctors' on more than one occasion due to the pain, and regularly phoned in sick until my issues were sorted. I also had excessively heavy episodes. Luckily I had a very understanding (male) boss who put the days through as holidays. Sian, Manchester, UK I think women probably should be given leave if they want it. How bad they suffer may be subjective to the individual but the option of leave should be given regardless. Punishing anyone by making them work while they are suffering is barbaric and ridiculous. James Todd, Renfrewshire, Scotland, UK Luckily I work in an office with other women, with a female boss. When I have cramps so bad I'm throwing up, I can get someone to cover.

        "The world's biggest clothing retailer posted net earnings of EUR1.26bn (PS1.1bn) in the six months to 31 July - up 8 on the same period last year. Sales jumped from EUR9.4bn to EUR10.5bn, an increase of 11. The group's clothes can now be bought online in around 40 countries, it said. Inditex operates eight brands in 90 countries including PullBear, Massimo Dutti and Bershka. How Zara's founder became the richest man in the world - for two days Chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla emphasised the firm's investment in technology, saying the firm had expanded its online stores to 11 new countries in the period. It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of \"extending the service to other countries.\" This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet. Mr Isla said: \"Both our online and bricks-and-mortar stores are seamlessly connected, driven by platforms such as mobile payment, and other technological initiatives that we will continue to develop.\" Tom Gadsby, an analyst at Liberum, said the firm's \"online drive\" was important. \"I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important,\" he said. \"And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate [online], most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online. \"So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories.\" The company also said it had benefited from steady economic growth in Spain, where Inditex gets about a fifth of its sales. That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3 in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency. All of the group's brands increased their international presence during the period, with 83 new stores opened in 38 countries.

        "Every practising nurse and midwife must be on the UK register, but not everyone on the register will be practising, or working in the NHS. However, the government has said that there has been a 13,100 rise in the number of nurses actually working on NHS wards in England since May 2010, when the Conservatives came into power as part of the coalition government. But this is only true if you look just at nurses working on acute, elderly or general wards. If you look at all areas of nursing, the number of staff - or the equivalent in terms of full-time hours - did increase between May 2010 and March 2017, the latest date we have figures for, but by a more modest 5,000. To confuse things further, the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, tweeted earlier this month that there were 15,000 more nurses since he took up the post, in September 2012. This is because the overall number of nurses working for the NHS in England fell by almost 10,000 between 2010 and 2012 and then went back up again by just under 15,000 between 2012 and 2017, resulting in that net increase of almost 5,000. This figure includes health visitors, who are qualified nurses. The overall increase in numbers of nurses working in the NHS masks a net fall in some areas of nursing. For example, since May 2010, the numbers of community, mental health nurses and specialist learning disability nurses have fallen. And, meanwhile, the number of nursing posts lying vacant doubled between 2013 and 2016, from 20,000 to 40,000, according to figures from the Royal College of Nursing. So the gap between how many nurses we have and how many we need has widened.",

        "His correspondents included David Lloyd George, William Gladstone, Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw and Arthur Conan Doyle. And on his death 100 years ago, obituaries were effusive in their praise, calling him the last of the great Victorians. You would be forgiven for the name Charles Darwin popping into your head - but you would be wrong. The theory of evolution by natural selection was published jointly between Darwin and Monmouthshire-born Alfred Russel Wallace, whose interest in natural history developed when he moved to Neath and worked as a land surveyor with his brother. But while today Darwin is a household name synonymous with the theory, Wallace struggles to gain anywhere near the recognition of his friend. This is illustrated by an appeal this year to raise funds for a life-sized bronze statue to honour Wallace - it only reached half of its PS50,000 target. Wallace expert Dr George Beccaloni, who is a curator at the Natural History Museum where the statue would stand, said: \"We have enough money to pay for a torso and arms at the moment. \"There are hundreds of Darwin statues and busts but there's not even a bust of Wallace. \"There's a side-profile roundel on the wall at Westminster Abbey - not far from Darwin's grave. There's not a lot else.\" Interestingly, Wallace was not overlooked during his lifetime and was awarded the Order of Merit, the highest honour that could be given by the British monarch to a civilian. His correspondents included some of the most significant politicians in recent British history, and celebrated authors and poets. \"He was extremely famous and possibly the most famous scientist and one of the most famous people in the world when he died (in 1913),\" said Dr Beccaloni. \"There were very long, glowing obituaries in all the world's papers from Bombay to Boston saying he was the last of the great Victorians. \"One of the papers said only a great ruler would have had the sort of level of obituary recognition as Wallace.\" He said Darwin was more famous but died many years before Wallace leaving Wallace to go on and become \"the most famous living biologist in Britain.\" So where did it go wrong for Wallace's reputation? Prof Jim Costa, director of a biological research station in North Carolina, USA, and an expert on both men, says part of the problem appears to be that Wallace failed to promote his role in formulating the theory as effectively as Darwin. While they had jointly published the theory of evolution by natural selection in a paper in August 1858, it was Darwin's On the Origin of Species the very next year that truly grabbed the public's imagination. Even one of Wallace's own books appeared to pass on the credit for the discovery. It was called'Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection with Some of Its Applications'! Prof Costa said another factor was what became known as the \"eclipse of Darwinism,\" when natural selection fell out of favour in the late 19th Century. By the time it was revived in the 1930s, neither man was around and the world was a very different place. \"I think when this idea was resurrected in 1930 there was a new generation and they very much had Darwin on their minds,\" said Prof Costa. \"Wallace I think had a role in this - his book'Darwinism' for example. He tended to downplay his role in public forums and that just didn't serve him well. \"When it [natural selection] was resurrected, it was always associated with Darwin.\" He said when evolutionary biology really took off in the 1940s, the history of the discovery had been largely forgotten. A Darwin \"industry\" developed and, said Prof Costa, it viewed Darwin as the \"great visionary.\" While little has changed since in terms of public acclaim, there are signs that Wallace's work is gaining more recognition in certain circles. A series of events are being held around the world to commemorate the centenary of Wallace's death this year under the Wallace100 banner. These include an exhibition in Swansea, a lecture in Berlin and a two-day conference in Malaysia. Comedian Bill Bailey recently unveiled a restored portrait of Wallace at the Natural History Museum and has also filmed a two-part documentary for the BBC about Wallace. Thousands of Wallace's letters have been put online for the first time, including correspondence with Darwin about evolution by natural selection. There is even hope for the statue with renewed efforts being made to raise the rest of the money by August. But gaining the same level of acclaim as Darwin is another matter. \"I think that in the popular imagination, it would be very, very difficult. It's indelibly Darwin and monkeys,\" said Prof Costa. \"I don't think there's much we can do about that but I do think he will emerge from relative eclipse by Darwin, certainly in the broad academic world and the world of naturalists. \"He contributed so much.\"",
        "Bielik, 17, who underwent his medical at Arsenal last week, signed for Legia from their Polish rivals Lech Poznan in July and has made six appearances in all competitions this season. Arsenal say the deal \"is subject to the completion of regulatory processes.\" The Poland Under-17 international can play in both a holding midfield role and at centre-back. He said: \"I've decided to move to Arsenal and although I cannot be sure of what's to come in the future, I'm going to London to fulfil my dreams. \"I'm grateful to my team-mates and manager Henning Berg for trusting such a young player and giving me a chance to play for the first team.

        "The woman, in her 30s, and the child were abducted two men in Redcar, Teesside, at lunchtime on Friday. They were taken about four miles to Longbeck Lane, near Yearby, where the woman was raped. They were made to get out of the car six hours later in another area of Redcar. Police are investigating whether the attackers knew the victim. Temporary Det Ch Insp Matt Murphy-King said it had been a \"very traumatic ordeal for the victim and her child.\" \"Although we are investigating that the attackers may have known the victim, as a precaution I would encourage anyone in the local area to be extra vigilant,\" he said. \"There are a team of detectives working on this investigation and we have increased patrols in the local area.\" Cleveland Police want to speak to anyone who saw a woman with a child and \"in a distressed state\" running across the road towards a wooded area near Kirkleatham Lane, where she got out of the car. The force is also appealing for information about the two men in a dark-coloured saloon. The driver, in his late 20s or early 30s, was white, with short, brown hair and a large build, police said. He had the word \"love\" tattooed across his knuckles. The other man was white, in his early 20s, of shorter height and medium build, with brown hair.",
        "The plans for the development on the Hatchfield Farm estate in Newmarket, Suffolk, had been approved by Forest Heath District Council. But last year Local Government Secretary Sajiv Javid refused to accept the decision. Planning judge Mr Justice Gilbart ruled that Mr Javid's decision was fatally inconsistent and \"plainly deficient.\" The case will now have to be reconsidered. Mr Justice Gilbart, sitting in London, quashed the refusal, saying: \"The secretary of state has performed a complete and unexplained volte-face in his assessment of the highways impacts of two proposals for development on the same site in Newmarket and has also failed to apply his own National Planning Policy Framework.\" The judge said: \"There is on any view a requirement for more land for housing and other economic development in the Forest Heath District.\" Edward Stanley, the 19th Earl of Derby, brought the legal challenge with Moulton Parish Council and the Rural Parishes Alliance. The judge said local parish councils had for some time argued that growth in the area should not be dispersed among the rural parishes but concentrated in Newmarket. Newmarket Horsemen's Group and some others were concerned that development in the town \"may have an adverse effect on the horseracing industry that is based there\" and lead to increased traffic. A spokesman for Lord Derby said: \"The secretary of state now has a second chance to determine the application. He should take full account of the significant benefits the planning application will bring to Newmarket when making a decision.\" The Department for Communities and Local Government said: \"We have received this judgment and will now consider our response.\"",

        "ZTE Corp obtained and illegally shipped US-made equipment to Iran in violation of US sanctions, the Justice Department said. It also sent goods to North Korea without the correct export licences. The US said ZTE lied to authorities and its own lawyer about the violations. It must now pay a 892m (PS740m) penalty as well as 300m which will be suspended for seven years depending on the firm meeting certain conditions. ZTE says it acknowledges it has made mistakes, and is working towards improving its procedures. The US said that the highest levels of management at ZTE approved the scheme which involved the shipment of 32m worth of US-made goods to Iran between 2010 and 2016. The equipment included routers, microprocessors and servers controlled under export regulations for \"security, encryption.... andor anti-terrorism reasons.\" ZTE also made 283 shipments of mobile phones to North Korea despite knowing this contravened rules around exports to the country. According to Reuters, ZTE buys around a third of its its components from US businesses such as Qualcomm, Microsoft and Intel. It also sells phone handsets to major carriers such as T-Mobile and ATT. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said: \"ZTE Corporation not only violated export controls that keep sensitive American technology out of the hands of hostile regimes like Iran's - they lied to federal investigators and even deceived their own counsel and internal investigators about their illegal acts.\" He added: \"This plea agreement holds them accountable, and makes clear that our government will use every tool we have to punish companies who would violate our laws, obstruct justice and jeopardise our national security.\" The company reached the agreement with the US Justice, Commerce and Treasury departments. As part of the deal, it must submit to a three-year period of probation, during which time it will be independently monitored to ensure it remains compliant. Chairman and chief executive of ZTE, Zhao Xianming, said: \"ZTE acknowledges the mistakes it made, takes responsibility for them and remains committed to positive change in the company.\" \"Instituting new compliance-focused procedures and making significant personnel changes has been a top priority for the company.\"",
        "Pop star Katy Perry will make her debut at the festival, following a clutch of politically-charged performances at this year's Grammys and Brit Awards. Grime will feature prominently, with Stormzy, Kano and Wiley all playing. And Barry Gibb follows in the footsteps of Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers by taking Sunday evening's \"legend slot.\" The Bee Gees star appeared at the festival last year, duetting with Chris Martin on Stayin' Alive and To Love Somebody during Coldplay's headline set. Tickets for the festival, which takes place from 21 - 25 June in Somerset, have already sold out. It will be the last Glastonbury until 2019, with the festival taking a fallow year to allow Worthy Farm's cows (and Glastonbury's villagers) some time off. Among the acts announced today are: Krautrock pioneers The Can Project - featuring original Can members Irmin Schmidt and Malcolm Mooney, alongside Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and other guests - have also been added to the line-up. Organiser Emily Eavis said \"even more\" bands would be announced soon. The headliners had already been announced, with Radiohead leading the charge on the Pyramid Stage on Friday, 23 June. Foo Fighters take the Saturday night slot, making up for 2015 - when they were forced to cancel after Dave Grohl broke his leg falling off a stage in Sweden. Ed Sheeran will close the festival on Sunday, just six years after his first appearance, on the BBC Introducing stage, in 2011. Prior to today, country legend Kris Kristofferson was the only other performer confirmed - although Laura Marling, Wiley and The Avalanches all let the cat out of the bag. Organisers say \"twice as many\" bands will play the festival this year; alongside the usual complement of film, comedy and performance art. The BBC will feature 120 acts across six stages exclusively live on the BBC Glastonbury website. And you can see live pictures from the farm 365 days of the year on the Glastonbury webcam.

        "The three children were placed in foster care after the couple's arrest by counter-terrorism officers in 2015. Mr Justice Cobb said he was suspicious the parents were going to areas controlled by so-called Islamic State. But he said their \"attitude\" had \"genuinely changed\" and he concluded that the children should return home. The judge, who is based in the Family Division of the High Court, said he was also satisfied that the couple will meet their children's needs. He said evidence showed that being in the family home will be in their best interests. Details of the case have emerged in rulings published by Mr Justice Cobb following private family court hearings in Leeds. The judge did not identify the couple. He said they were from London but lived in the north-east of England. Council social workers had asked him to make decisions about where the children should live. The couple were arrested while in a car with their children at the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone, Kent, during the summer of 2015. They had not been accused of any terrorism-related offences as a result of their arrest, but had faced fraud charges. The couple had told police that they were travelling to Germany to visit relatives, although the man admitted that he had been \"drawn into radical extreme thinking.\" Mr Justice Cobb said evidence caused him \"very considerable concern\" and he said he was \"suspicious\" that the couple had been heading for areas of the Middle East controlled by IS. But he said suspicion was not enough. Mr Justice Cobb said he had been told how the couple had co-operated with social services after the children were taken into foster care. The father said he accepted that things he had said before were \"not appropriate\" and \"not a true expression of Islam,\" and the mother had accepted that views she expressed \"were wrong.\" \"I am sufficiently satisfied.... that the attitudes of these parents have genuinely changed,\" said Mr Justice Cobb. \"I am satisfied from the information placed before me that these parents [will meet] the needs of these.... children in all material respects.\" He added: \"All relevant considerations point to the conclusion that it is indeed in the best interests of the children that they should [be] at home in the care of their parents.\"",
        "The school has stopped the game, also known as \"tag\" or \"you're it,\" to allow the children \"some time to settle down a bit,\" according to the headmaster. The ban is the latest in a line of stories from around England of educational establishments outlawing everyday activities, many of which are remembered fondly from people's own school days. BBC News looks back at other forbidden school pursuits that have made headlines: We start off with a perhaps unsurprising measure many schools enforce. British Bulldog involves charging towards fellow pupils, a drop of the shoulder to fool the'bulldogs' and a rapid dash to the safety of the other side of the yard. These figures are a little old (like the above image), but over a quarter of 653 school staff surveyed by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in 2011 said it had been banned from their school. One secondary school teacher said it was \"because of the number of broken bones it generates!\" Schools in Wiltshire, Cumbria and Clackmannanshire introduced a ban on conkers over fears the horse chestnuts could trigger anaphylactic reactions. The Anaphylaxis Campaign said a \"common sense approach\" would be better, where conkers are put in a safe place after battle and all involved give their hands a good wash. Some schools took to allowing their children to take part in conker fights provided they were wearing protective goggles. A Carlisle headteacher said it was a \"sensible\" step to shield children's eyes from pieces of flying horse chestnut. In January, birthday cakes were banned at a Blackpool primary school as teachers \"do not have time\" to check ingredients for pupils with allergies. Parents of children at Norbreck Primary Academy were told cakes taken into school would be \"sent home uneaten.\" The headteacher wrote: \"I hate to be a killjoy.... there are many reasons for this, some of them serious.\" Pupils in Birmingham had to leave school after teachers said they were wearing the wrong kind of shoes. Baverstock Academy, in Druids Heath, sent out letters informing families of new rules making plain black shoes compulsory. One parent reported the \"ridiculous\" decision led to \"chaotic\" scenes, with about 300 children being sent home. The school later relaxed the rule slightly, according to parents. It wasn't the pupils but their parents who were making a scene at a primary school in Darlington. Grown-ups on the school run were asked by the headteacher of Skerne Park Academy to wash in the morning and to not drop their kids off while wearing pyjamas. The final straw came when parents were turning up to parents' evenings and even the Christmas show in their PJs, the head said. A West Yorkshire head teacher banned books containing stories about pigs from key stage one classrooms in case they offended Muslim children. The literature was removed from classes for under-sevens at Park Road Junior Infant and Nursery School in Batley. Head Barbara Harris said the books would remain in the school library for children to read, but added: \"We try to be sensitive to the fact that for Muslims talk of pigs is offensive.\" Pupils in South Gloucestershire were banned from wearing tinsel to a non-uniform day because teachers say it could cause litter and be dangerous. Staff at Chipping Sodbury school said the festive decoration could cause injury if pupils tried to strangle each other. Children were sent home with a letter citing \"health and safety reasons\" for the ban. The local council said the day was \"far from being against the spirit of Christmas\" and was in aid of the charity Crisis.",
        "Two reports, published in November, criticised the regulator at the time for failing to take action. One of those reports, by barrister Andrew Green QC, said regulators should consider banning 10 former HBOS executives. A new investigation has now been announced by regulators. \"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have decided to start investigations into certain former HBOS senior managers,\" the regulators said. \"These investigations will determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced against them. The FCA and PRA continue to review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers.\" No details are being given as to the exact nature of the investigations, who is being investigated, or the timeframe of the inquiry. A Bank of EnglandFCA report examined the failure of HBOS, while Mr Green examined decisions taken by the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator at the time of the HBOS demise. Both were published in November. So far the only person to have been banned is Peter Cummings, who was previously the head of corporate lending at HBOS. In 2012, he was fined PS500,000, and banned from senior positions in banking. In his report, Mr Green suggested that the Bank of England's PRA and the FCA should consider prohibition proceedings against former executives. That included Andy Hornby, HBOS chief executive from 2006 to 2009. Mr Green said the FSA was \"misguided\" when it took the decision not to take action against Mr Hornby. Other former HBOS executives named in the report included Lord Stevenson, and Mike Ellis, the former group finance director at HBOS. Lindsay Mackay, the head of HBOS's Treasury division from 2004, could also be banned, November's report said. James Crosby, HBOS chief executive from 2001 to 2006, has retired. He gave up his knighthood in 2009, and surrendered part of his pension. Eight former non-executive directors of HBOS were criticised in the report, although they said they disagreed with its findings. The eight, including Lord Stevenson and Carphone Warehouse founder Sir Charles Dunstone, said the report had downplayed the \"unforeseeable\" effects of the financial crisis.",

        "The 33-year-old goalkeeper was busy in a 3-3 draw, his first taste of the Champions League group stage. Having been the number one choice for the past two seasons, Gordon was playing after Dorus de Vries picked up an injury at the weekend. \"I was happy with how I played - that's all I can do,\" he said. \"Everybody wants to be a part of nights like that. There is no bigger incentive to play well and keep your place.\" Former Hearts and Sunderland keeper Gordon started the first nine matches of the season but lost his place to summer recruit De Vries in mid-August. Gordon was a half-time replacement in Saturday's win over Kilmarnock, with the 35-year-old Dutchman suffering a chest injury. De Vries was fit enough to be among the substitutes in a thriller with Manchester City in which Gordon made two good stops to deny Ilkay Gundogan, one late in the game from a deflected strike. \"This is the highest level of club football and to finally manage that at the age of 33 is a special moment for me,\" said Gordon. \"We'd have liked to get the three points but it was an incredible effort against a top quality side.\" Asked how the match ranked in his long career, he replied: \"It's right up there. The atmosphere was just incredible. \"The noise was unbelievable. There was a couple of times when I was absolutely screaming at Kolo [Toure] to leave the ball and he just couldn't hear me. I couldn't have shouted any louder.\" Gordon, capped 44 times for Scotland, insists his self-belief has not wavered since dropping to the bench and is hoping manager Brendan Rodgers will find it difficult to reinstate De Vries. \"I've always been confident in what I'm able to do,\" he added. \"It was other people saying my confidence was gone. \"If I've not been selected, that's the manager's decision and I fully respect that. \"The other side of that is that I want to play every game. \"I think I've done pretty well in stages this season and if I can get a run in the team then hopefully I can go from strength to strength.\"",

        "Adam Purinton, 51, fled the scene of the attack at a pub in Olathe and went to a restaurant where he confided in a staff member, police say. He was arraigned in court on Monday with first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. The accused wore a safety smock to prevent him from harming himself. Police say he shot and killed Srinivas Kuchibholta at a pub on Wednesday evening. He allegedly fired on Mr Kuchibhotla and his friend Alok Madasani, two 32-year-old Indian men who worked as engineers at GPS-maker Garmin. Mr Kuchibhotla died and Mr Madasani survived. A third patron, 24-year-old Ian Grillot, was wounded trying to intervene. The FBI is investigating whether the shooting constitutes a hate crime. After the attack at Austins Bar and Grill, the suspect, who is white, drove 70 miles (112km) to an Applebee's in Clinton, Missouri, where he allegedly admitted what he had done to an employee. On Saturday at 11am, the doors of Austin Bar and Grill reopened, after a fatal shooting which has shaken people here in Olathe and beyond. \"We've come back to show we won't let the attacker change our way of life,\" said one patron who'd turned up. Austins is your regular local bar in a strip mall. It serves the usual diet of fried food and beers, with sport on big screens. But, Austins is now also the place which robbed one man of his life, and left two others injured. As Alok Madasani sat in pain in his living room, nursing an injury caused by the bullet which struck his thigh, he told me how he and Srinivas were so well known at the bar the staff knew how much ice they took in their drinks. Until that fateful night, he said he'd never heard anyone use overtly racist language in Olathe. And many other Indians I met at a vigil on Friday night echoed that sentiment. They said Olathe has always been a friendly and welcoming place. One man said he hoped this tragedy was a \"one-off,\" and that the show of support here would help heal the many hearts, which have been broken. In a 911 call, a bartender, Sam Suida, told the police dispatcher a man had come into the bar and said he'd done something \"really bad\" and that he was on the run. \"He asked if he could stay with me and my husband, and he wouldn't tell me what he did,\" she says on a recording of the call. \"I kept asking him, and he said that he would tell me if I agreed to let him stay with me. \"Well, I finally got him to tell me and he said, like, that he shot and killed two Iranian people in Olathe.\" The shooting drew worldwide attention and has gripped the Indian-American community. Hillary Clinton weighed in on the matter on Twitter on Monday, demanding President Donald Trump speak out against intolerance following the shooting. \"With threats hate crimes on rise, we shouldn't have to tell POTUS to do his part. He must step up speak out,\" the former Democratic presidential candidate tweeted. Mr Trump has yet to comment, but his press secretary, Sean Spicer, said on Monday that early reports on the Kansas shooting were \"disturbing.\" Witnesses said the suspect shouted \"get out of my country\" before shots rang out. Mr Madasani told the BBC the gunman had demanded to know if they were in the country legally. The suspect is being held in the Johnson County Jail on a bond of 2m (PS1.6m). His next court appearance is on 9 March.",

A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"School employers are responsible for the health and safety of staff and pupils whether the local authority, governing body or academy trust, and they must adhere to the Health and Safety Act 1974.\" Teachers also received smaller payouts over accidents in the workplace, including a PS55,000 package for a female member of staff in north-west England who tripped on a tear in the lino surface of her science classroom. She was later diagnosed with chronic back syndrome. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said many of the injuries would be reduced if employers \"took the welfare of staff seriously\" and followed good health and safety practices. She said: \"The consequence of negligence is careers, lives and health blighted and millions of pounds of public money spent in compensation. \"Unfortunately, there is no incentive for employers to take health and welfare seriously when they witness the government cutting funding for inspection and failing to take steps to secure compliance with the law. \"Failure to respect the rights of employees and to comply with employment law is also prevalent. \"Employers flout the law, but it's the teachers and the taxpayers who pay the price. \"While compensation is important, it can never make up for the fact that teachers suffer permanent physical and mental injury and often cannot continue in their chosen career.\" Separate data from the NUT, which keeps its overall compensation figures private, said there were two cases of personal injury compensation paid to its members last year. One included a PS46,000 payout to a teacher who suffered \"severe psychological injury\" following \"a sustained campaign of bullying and harassment by senior leadership.\" Another NUT member was awarded just under PS4,500 after she fractured a finger on a defective doorknob, causing her long-term aches and a deformity. The union said it offered legal help in 130 cases last year, including 71 involving criminal activity and 57 in employment cases.",
        "The 28-year-old, who has been first choice for the Chiefs this season, has torn a pectoral muscle. Dave Lewis started in place of Chudley in Sunday's win over Ulster while Stuart Townsend came on for his first game outside the Anglo-Welsh Cup. \"You've just got to get on with it, and we'll get on with it with a team that's got some momentum at the moment,\" head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon. As well as Townsend and Lewis the Chiefs also have highly-rated teenager Jack Maunder, Fiji international Niko Matawalu and veteran Haydn Thomas on the books at scrum-half. \"That's his (Townsend's) championship rugby debut, how well he did in a pressure situation,\" added Baxter. \"His kicking was fantastic, his defensive work was absolutely top drawer and you look at that and your mouth waters to the future we could have in the scrum-half department.\"",
        "\"Donor fatigue\" had led to funding for SW Radio Africa drying up, its manager Gerry Jackson told the BBC. The station was launched when President Robert Mugabe faced strong opposition to his rule from the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party. After four years in coalition with the MDC, Mr Mugabe fended off his rivals and was re-elected to office last year. Ms Jackson said the long crisis in Zimbabwe, and the \"massive disarray\" in the ranks of the MDC, had contributed to \"donor fatigue.\" Seizing radios The European Union (EU) had also decided to \"re-engage with Mugabe and the ruling Zanu-PF party, which may have influenced some donors who do not want a critical voice out there,\" she added. BBC World Service Africa editor Richard Hamilton says SW Radio Africa's final news bulletin, from an office outside London, was tinged with sadness. Although the Zimbabwean government jammed some of its short wave broadcasts, SW Radio Africa still had its loyal listeners - estimated at one point at around one million, he says. \"We are gone so our voice is completely gone,\" Ms Jackson told the BBC.",
        "At the start of each month Elena, a 40-year-old Muscovite, spreads all the family cash on the table and starts dividing it into small piles. \"When I do this I shake, I feel nauseous,\" she says. \"This goes to one bank, that to another, then the third one... There's one more bank, but we don't have the money for them - I had to go and buy some food. I guess we'll have to put up with their telephone reminders.\" Elena and her husband owe well over 1m roubles (about PS10,800; 17,000) to those four banks. After the cash piles are sorted the family of three is left with only 10,000 roubles (PS107; 167). That puts them below the poverty line - and recently Elena lost her job. Millions of those in debt live like Elena. According to the Russian United Credit Bureau (UCB), 40 million Russians have loans or mortgages. By June, 12.5m of those loans had not been paid for at least a month, and in another 8m cases the arrears stretched back over three months. The Russian Central Bank says total personal debt has risen to 1tn roubles (PS10.7bn; 16.7bn). At least 10 of that amount cannot be recovered by the banks. For Elena and her husband, this is a story of almost two decades of borrowing. They started getting loans in the mid-1990s to pay for their daughter's medical treatment. Then they took a bigger loan to pay off the smaller ones. It all seemed manageable, says Elena, but then new expenses came along - and two banks offered credit cards with generous conditions. \"We were a bit stupid,\" Elena says. \"They told us the minimum payment was 5,000 roubles a month and we paid that every month. But that was just the interest, not the loan itself.\" During Russia's boom years credit history checks meant virtually nothing. An individual already saddled with loans could take out another one, hoping to pay off previous debts. The small print was often too small to bother about. Then the music stopped. Money got tight after the 2008 global financial crisis and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict. The average personal loan in 2014 was 54,600 roubles. Olga Mazurova is head of Sentinel Credit Management, one of Russia's largest debt-collecting agencies. She says that often Russians are hit by a sudden drop in income, because \"the firm goes bankrupt, the working week is cut, there are layoffs or wage cuts - we see that especially in industrial cities in Siberia and the Urals.\" Few Russians have insurance for such contingencies, she says. Debtors cannot get much help. There are plans to amend the law on insolvency, to allow individuals to be declared bankrupt. But nothing will happen on that until October. Russian MPs decided that criminal courts were unprepared for the likely flood of such cases and that courts of arbitration should handle debt cases instead. Each debtor has to beg the bank to cut them some slack. But Russia's financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev says that rarely works if someone owes money to more than one institution. A former adviser to President Vladimir Putin, he knows many top Russian financiers personally - but that does not help him to lobby on behalf of indebted callers. Typically, he says, lenders refuse to restructure personal debts with the words: \"I've got a business to run and shareholders demand profits - I can't do it!\" Mr Medvedev says his success rate in helping debtors has dropped from 51 to 33 and \"this year it's probably going to be around 16.\" He had no solution for one caller, Vladimir Frolov, living near Moscow. Mr Frolov started borrowing four years ago to help his partner, living separately from him, in Ukraine. The debts snowballed. Finally, unable to get an unsecured loan, he mortgaged the flat he shares with his elderly parents. His father Anatoly, who co-signed the agreement, is bewildered when asked which bank it was. \"How should I know? They took us into some room, the light was dim and the print was tiny. I just asked if everything was alright and they told me it was.\" Besides the mortgage, Vladimir Frolov's parents took out two loans to help him, which eat up 18,000 of their 22,000-rouble monthly pension allowance. And now Vladimir has defaulted on the mortgage. The bank is suing and they may well lose their only dwelling. \"There must be a normal way out - maybe give the bank a fixed share of my wages?\" Vladimir wonders. But so far he has not found anyone at the bank to discuss his dilemma. \"Isn't there a law against this?\" asks his father, equally helplessly. \"How can they let people borrow so much without checking them first?\" After the good years many Russians are now getting a harsh lesson in capitalism - and inadequate regulations mean there is nothing to soften the blow.",
        "The 27-year-old had been set for a rematch with Nate Diaz, who beat him in their welterweight fight in March, at the Las Vegas event in July. After a dispute over promotional duties, UFC president Dana White said organisers were looking for a replacement for the Irishman. But McGregor said on Sunday: \"Happy to announce that I am back on UFC 200.\" Writing on social media, he added: \"Shout out to Dana White and Lorenzo Fertitta on getting this one done for the fans. Respect.\" But US media, including the Los Angeles Times, quoted White as saying: \"We haven't talked to Conor or his manager since the press conference. I don't know why he would tweet that.\" And McGregor's manager John Kavanagh later added: \"I'm 51 optimistic and 49 pessimistic, if you want to know my feelings on it.\" McGregor started speculation he was quitting last week when he tweeted: \"I have decided to retire young. Thanks for the cheese.\" But in a statement two days later, he said: \"I am not retired.\" White claimed McGregor was withdrawn from the card for refusing to fly to Las Vegas for a news conference and promotional photographs. In his statement, the fighter claimed he was being asked to do too much promotional work by the UFC and was not able to concentrate on his training.",

        "Social media videos shot in the Plaza Major showed injured fans and officers in body armour wielding batons. BBC journalist Phil Mackie confirmed police used baton charges to clear parts of the square. Earlier, Spanish police said eight Leicester fans were arrested for \"causing a mess\" on Tuesday night. Footage posted online showed a group of officers being targeted with missiles and fans chanting \"Gibraltar is ours\" in the Plaza Major, where Leicester's fans were told they could congregate. A witness told BBC 5 live: \"There were a couple of people who probably antagonised the police, but then they took it out all these people here. \"There were people with children, they came in with batons and there was a 70-year-old man and the kids [in the way].\" Owynn Palmer-Atkin, reporting for BBC Radio Leicester, said: \"There was a couple of flares that went off - blue smoke, then a bang, and that is when you heard the tone of the chanting change. \"The noise of the crowd seem to quieten and then become more of a panic. \"There was another bang and that is when the riot vans started charging across the square. I find it incredible a police van would travel that fast in a crowded square.\" BBC presenter Gary Lineker, a Leicester City fan and former Foxes player, tweeted: \"Just saw the footage of some Leicester fans behaving despicably in Madrid. The few idiots ruin it for the decent majority. Sickening..\" On Tuesday night, Phil Mackie said he witnessed what appeared to be an unprovoked attack on supporters. He reported seeing police charging a group of Leicester fans walking in the city centre before three were pushed to the ground, hit with batons and bundled into the back of vans. Police said six officers were also attacked in the overnight disturbances. The eight fans arrested remain in custody and will appear in court on Thursday.",
        "The chain, which floated on the stock market in June 2014, reported like-for-like growth of 1.1 for the 13 weeks to 27 June. That was markedly lower than the 6 recorded in the same period last year. BM blamed disappointing weather in May, which held back sales of outdoor seasonal products, for the decline. Chief executive Simon Arora said: \"As consumer spending improves, it is apparent that shoppers remain keen to spend with value retailers and we continue to win market share.\" Discount retailers such as Poundland, 99p Stores and BM have opened hundreds of stores in recent years and won customers from supermarket chains as shoppers seek lower prices. BM opened 25 net new stores in the quarter, with some of the new openings being among its most successful. The company now has 450 outlets in the UK and plans to open a total of 80 this year as it heads towards a target of 850. It also has 51 stores in Germany mostly under the \"Jawoll\" brand. \"We remain confident that future store expansion opportunities will allow us to increase market share in both the UK and Germany,\" BM said. Total revenue for the quarter rose 24.4 to PS456.6m compared with the same period last year. Shares rose 2.8, or 9.7p, to 349.7p in morning trading in London, valuing the group at PS3.5bn. The shares have risen more than 22 since the float last year. The flotation resulted in a PS1bn windfall for the three Arora brothers, who have led the expansion of the company.",

The pub is owned by Samuel Smiths brewery, based at Tadcaster in North Yorkshire, who have not responded to a BBC request for comment. Solicitor Euan Lawrence said it was not against the law for the brewery to ban a group of bikers from its pubs. Read more about this and other stories from across Yorkshire The independent brewery, which has around 200 pubs, recently banned people from swearing on its premises. Mr Smith said the new ban emerged when he visited his local pub. \"Before I even got to the car park a guy greeted me and said'we're not allowed in, bikers are barred'. \"I parked up and I am getting my gear off and a staff member came out to greet me and said'I can't serve you, we've barred bikes'.\" Mr Smith said the staff member told him the decision came from the brewery and no reason to bar him and other bikers was given. Euan Lawrence, from Black's Solicitors in Leeds, said bikers were not a \"protected group\" under the Equality Act. \"Whilst many people would say'well in the plain English meaning of the word discrimination then yes it is discrimination'. \"But for the purposes of the law and whether or not there is a remedy in respect of that discrimination - the short answer is there is not.\"",
        "Zohore's double helped Cardiff to a 3-1 win over Ipswich Town as the Denmark U21 striker took his tally to nine goals in his last 10 league games. \"I wouldn't swap him for many in the Championship,\" said Warnock. \"He's got every attribute and you can't coach what he has got.\" Warnock believes his management has been key in getting the best out of Zohore. \"There was not a player here like that when I came here,\" Warnock told BBC Wales Sport. \"He was not a waste of time, but he wasn't far away from being a waste of time. \"He walked about, wouldn't tackle, wouldn't chase back and he wore gloves everywhere. \"You name it really. \"But he's a good lad and the chat I had with him against Wolves at half-time (in December) was obviously vital, because he's been a revelation since then.\" Warnock says the transformation in Zohore's game is comparable to that of some Premier League and international players he has worked with in his lengthy managerial career. \"Oh yeah, Victor Moses (now at Chelsea) was one, there have been a few players who surprised me,\" Warnock said. \"A few that didn't realise (how good they could be). Phil Jagielka (Everton and England) is another, when I first got hold of him. \"Some lads don't believe in themselves and need convincing. \"The minimum you should get out of a player is 100. Then the ability goes on top. \"You need that work ethic at any level of the game. \"When you do that, you make your own luck, as Gary Player used to say.\" However, Warnock is unconcerned that rival clubs might be looking at Zohore, who he has previously stated was not for sale, even at PS20 million. \"He will not be going anywhere,\" added Warnock. \"I am happy with that. They won't sell him behind my back, I will tell you that. \"I think Vincent (Tan) is enjoying it as much as me.\" Warnock also feels he has improved winger Kadeem Harris, whose direct running led to Cardiff's third goal. \"He's another one like Ken, I think he needs me more than I need him,\" he said. \"I thought he'd been here six months, but he's been here three or four years,\" \"So he's been a waste of time, hasn't he? So hopefully the penny drops and he stays with us. \"I have talked to his dad a couple of times.

        "Oliver Whiting, 37, of Eastbourne, took the photos from social media accounts. He posted the images on adult websites, where he invited other users to join him in posting lewd comments. The judge at Hastings Magistrates' Court said his violation and degradation of women required punishment in order to deter others. Whiting had admitted 11 offences of making offensive posts at an earlier hearing. Six offences related to one victim, and five to the other. Live: More news from Sussex Whiting, of Langdale Close, was ordered to attend a sex offenders' treatment programme and banned from using social media. He was also ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Next to a picture of one woman he knew, which featured her young child, he labelled her a \"slag\" and a \"whore.\" Prosecutor Elizabeth Green said the victim was left \"distressed\" at being unable to get the US-based website to remove the image, and it still remains on there. In a statement, the victim added: \"I felt alone and that no-one would help me.\" Ms Green said a second young woman known to Whiting was left \"physically sick\" and \"shocked\" after she discovered he had also posted a picture of her next to offensive comments he had written. Whiting was charged after previously being cautioned for similar offences involving four other women, an earlier court hearing was told. Defending, Noelle Magennis said Whiting had shown \"genuine heartfelt remorse,\" been the subject of a \"public witch-hunt\" and had contacted the website to try to get the images removed. Sentencing him, district judge Teresa Szagun said: \"What you used those photographs for defies belief. \"You uploaded them to a website that encourages other men to masturbate then capture that activity and upload those photographs on that site. \"The accompanying comments that you posted were vile, aggressive sexual fantasies. \"The impact to the victims has been far-reaching, ranging understandably from fear, disgust and extreme humiliation.\"",
        "The artists wrote graffiti reading \"Homeland is racist\" and \"Homeland is rubbish,\" among others. They say they were asked to write the graffiti in June to \"lend authenticity\" to a set depicting a refugee camp. The episode featuring the set in question aired on 11 October in the US. It will be broadcast on Sunday in the UK. Some of the messages were briefly visible in the background of the scenes depicting a Syrian refugee camp in Lebanon. The artists said in a statement that they were initially reluctant about the commission \"until we considered what a moment of intervention could relay about our own and many others' political discontent with the series.\" \"It was our moment to make our point by subverting the message using the show itself,\" they said. They said that no-one working on the show checked what it was that they were actually writing, with the set designers \"too frantic to pay any attention to us\" and the Arabic script treated as \"merely a supplementary visual.\" Caram Kapp, one of the artists, told the BBC: \"In this graffiti we are trying to call for a more differentiated view of the region, and we're also trying to say that things aren't as simple as they seem on this show.\" In the second series of the show, its depiction of the Lebanese capital Beirut sparked criticism with many pointing out that its portrayal of the city's central Hamra Street thoroughfare bore little relation to reality.

        "Immigration, healthcare and outreach to Latino voters dominated the debate, which disintegrated into long periods of shouting and personal insults. Mr Trump has won three of the first four contests held so far. Next week's vote in 11 states is held on what is known as Super Tuesday. The three men are seeking to be named as the Republican candidate in November's presidential election. At long last the Republican candidates have come to the realisation that Donald Trump can actually win this race, but it may be too late. For more than two hours, Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took turns throwing punches at the New Yorker. They attacked him on his business record; they mentioned hypocrisy; they questioned his conservative credentials; and they criticised the lack of detail in his policies and his reliance on bluster. \"We're having a lot of fun up here, aren't we?\" the front-runner quipped at one point. But the truth is that Mr Trump was on his heels for much of the evening. The challenge for the men who would unseat the leader, however, is that the best time to bludgeon a candidate is before it is clear circumstances are forcing you to act. In a campaign where authenticity is worshipped above all, Thursday's fireworks could smack of the kind of political expediency many associate with traditional politicians. Both Mr Cruz and Mr Rubio drew blood with their attacks but Mr Trump will be likely to emerge unbowed. How Cruz and Rubio double-teamed Trump What makes Super Tuesday super? - The long day of voting explained The Republicans who hate Trump - Lifelong members of the party speak out Mr Rubio, who has come second in several recent contests, mounted a series of attacks on Mr Trump. \"If he hadn't inherited 200m, you know where Donald Trump would be?\" Mr Rubio said in one tense exchange. \"Selling watches in Manhattan.\" Mr Rubio also criticised Mr Trump's failed online education venture, Trump University, and assailed him for hiring foreign workers rather than Americans in his construction projects. Mr Trump shot back: \"I hired tens of thousands of people. You've hired nobody.\" The billionaire real estate mogul found himself increasingly on the defensive about his business dealings and his conservative credentials. In other exchanges The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at. Trump on Rubio: \"This guy's a choke artist [not able to deliver on stage].\" Rubio to Trump: \"You're a lousy businessman.\" \"If he hadn't inherited 200m, you know where Donald Trump would be right now, selling watches in Manhattan.\" Trump to Cruz: \"This guy is a liar.\" Cruz response: \"Falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie, and it's something Donald does daily.\" Trump to Cruz: \"You get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican senator backing you. Not one...You should be ashamed of yourself.\" \"I know you're embarrassed.\" Rubio to Trump: \"You're the only person on this stage that's ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.\" Trump response: \"I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. I've hired tens of thousands of people over my job. You've hired nobody. You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards.\" Mr Trump has been extremely popular despite his controversial comments about deporting millions of undocumented workers and banning Muslims from travelling to the US. He is currently leading in 10 out of 11 states holding contests on Super Tuesday when a quarter of the total numbers of delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination will be up for grabs. He has 82 Republican party delegates, Mr Cruz has 17 and Mr Rubio has 16. To become the Republican party's nominee, a candidate has to have 1,237 total state delegates. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will compete for 1,004 delegates on Super Tuesday. Mrs Clinton has a clear lead with 505 delegates, but the majority are super delegates who can change their mind during the course of the campaign. Mr Sanders has secured 71 delegates in the first three races.

        "He told the United Nations General Assembly that world leaders, notably Germany and Canada, have vowed to double the number from last year. \"We are facing a crisis of epic proportion,\" Mr Obama said. About 21 million refugees have been forced to flee their countries due to conflict or persecution, the UN says. Nine million people alone have been displaced by the six-year conflict in Syria while more than four million others have fled the war-torn country. \"We cannot avert our eyes or turn our backs. To slam the door in the face of these families would betray our deepest values,\" he added. The US has agreed to take in 110,000 new refugees in the 2017 fiscal year - which begins on 1 October- compared with the 85,000 refugees it expects by the end of September. The president's remarks come a day after a US and Russia-brokered ceasefire unravelled, partly due to a US-led air strike over the weekend that mistakenly killed Syrian soldiers. Tensions continued on Monday when a strike, which witnesses say came from the air, hit an aid convoy at Urum al-Kubra, destroying 18 UN lorries and killing about 20 civilians. The UN has since suspended all aid convoys to Syria in response. Both Russia and Syria have insisted their forces were not behind the strike. The president's announcement also included a pledge by countries to increase financial contributions to UN appeals and humanitarian groups by about 4.5b (PS3.5b) over 2015 levels. Participating countries have vowed to help fund schools for a million refugee children as well as assist in helping one million refugees work legally. Mr Obama used his eighth and final UN address as president to call for a \"course correction\" to ensure that extremism and violence does not drive countries into a more divided world. \"Together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home,\" he said. Though he made no direct mention of the US, Mr Obama said wealthy countries with the resources should do more to help. In what appeared to be a dig at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, he added: \"The world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent (extremism) from affecting our own societies.\" Hours earlier, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also expressed concern over the conflict in Syria, saying there was \"no military solution.\" \"Gulfs of mistrust divide citizens from their leaders. Extremists push people into camps of'us' and'them',\" Mr Ban said, taking the world stage for the last time as secretary general. \"The Earth assails us with rising seas, record heat and extreme storms. And danger defines the days of many.\"",
        "The 43bn (PS33bn) deal is set to be the biggest ever foreign takeover by a Chinese company. The deal was cleared by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) which checks deals for national security implications. About a quarter of Syngenta's sales are in North America. China National Chemical Corporation offered 465 per share for Syngenta in February. Syngenta's shares subsequently fell to about 20 below that because of concerns that CFIUS would not clear the deal. However, now competition authorities elsewhere are expected to give the deal the go-ahead. In a joint statement, Syngenta and ChemChina said: \"In addition to CFIUS clearance, the closing of the transaction is subject to anti-trust review by numerous regulators around the world and other customary closing conditions. \"Both companies are working closely with the regulatory agencies involved and discussions remain constructive. The proposed transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.\" When the deal was announced earlier this year, Syngenta chairman Michel Demare said that it would help the company's pesticides and seeds business to expand further in China. \"ChemChina has a very ambitious vision of the industry in the future,\" he said. \"Obviously it is very interested in securing food supply for 1.5 billion people and as a result knows that only technology can get them there.\" The Chinese company owns a variety of businesses, included the Italian tyre maker Pirelli, German machinery-maker KarussMaffei and Israel's biggest pesticides producer.

During that call Mr Hammond said he reiterated the UK's \"need for an immediate and unconditional humanitarian ceasefire.\" He said: \"I welcome indications that Israeli forces may begin to withdraw from Gaza within the next few days.\" Mr Hammond also told the Sunday Telegraph the crisis in Gaza could become \"an endless loop of violence.\" \"The British public has a strong sense that the situation of the civilian population in Gaza is simply intolerable and must be addressed - and we agree with them.\" In a strongly worded statement on Saturday, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had previously been \"right to say that Hamas is an appalling terrorist organisation.\" \"Its wholly unjustified rocket attacks on Israeli citizens, as well as building of tunnels for terrorist purposes, show the organisation's murderous intent and practice towards Israel and its citizens,\" he said. \"But the prime minister is wrong not to have opposed Israel's incursion into Gaza and his silence on the killing of hundreds of innocent Palestinian civilians caused by Israel's military action will be inexplicable to people across Britain and internationally.\" On Sunday Mr Miliband reiterated that criticism, telling the BBC the government needed to send \"a much clearer message to Israel that its actions in Gaza are unacceptable and unjustifiable.\" \"What I want to hear from David Cameron is that he believes Israel's actions are wrong and unjustified and we haven't heard that from him.\" He said rocket attacks on Israel by Palestinian militants \"cannot excuse the scale of the loss of life of innocent Palestinian civilians including children that we are seeing.\" The aim should be to \"force both sides to have a ceasefire and the long-term solution we need,\" he said. Downing Street said: \"The PM has been clear that both sides in the Gaza conflict need to observe a ceasefire. \"We are shocked that Ed Miliband would seek to misrepresent that position and play politics with such a serious issue.\" Some 1,700 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed since the conflict began more than three weeks ago. A total of 66 Israelis have died, all but two of them soldiers. A Thai worker in Israel also died. A UN-brokered humanitarian ceasefire, intended to last 72 hours, ended on Friday after less than five hours, with each side blaming the other. Israel says it is defending itself from attacks by Palestinian militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths in Gaza, saying fighters deliberately operate from civilian areas. Critics of Israel's actions say Gaza is so densely populated any conflict there will inevitably affect civilian areas and cause civilian casualties.",
        "Dyfed-Powys Police said training would begin on Wednesday ahead of them being deployed on the streets. Cameras are always on but only record once the officer presses a button. Police and crime commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said: \"The use of the cameras supports transparency in policing and will aid the investigation of complaints against officers.\" The move follows a three-month trial in 2015 and any member of the public has the right to request footage taken of them within 31 days. Any recordings not needed for policing purposes are automatically deleted from cloud storage after that time. The force said recordings would only be made if there was \"a policing need\" and officers would announce when they start and stop filming. Cameras will always be on standby, filming on a 30-second loop, but audio does not record until the officer presses the button. Chief Constable Mark Collins said: \"They will provide the public with more reassurance and will help officers to document valuable evidence - leading to swifter justice for victims.\"",
        "The ministry of information said it has \"successfully jammed the signals\" of the station. However, the BBC's Abdussalam Ahmed in Enugu says Radio Biafara is still broadcasting. It is not clear where it is based but it mainly broadcasts to the Igbo-speaking south-east of the country. The first republic of Biafra declared its independence from Nigeria in May 1967, but was eventually defeated after a three-year civil war that cost more than one million lives. Our correspondent says the station hosts phone-in programmes with listeners calling to talk about issues affecting their region and their desire to break away from Nigeria. It also attacks and ridicules President Muhammadu Buhari and other government officials. Although the Biafra uprising was quelled by the military, a group called the Movement for the Actualisation of a Sovereign State of Biafra (Massob) has attracted the support many young people in the region.

        "On Friday, Shane Long's first-half goal looked set to give the hosts victory before Luuk de Jong's late equaliser. \"I was very pleased - I thought we did fine,\" said O'Neill. \"The Dutch had good possession of the ball (early on), which was actually very good for us because we had to play without it for a little while.\" He added: \"Then we scored the goal, which obviously gave us a big lift. I thought we played fine, we kept possession of the ball reasonably well after that.\" Media playback is not supported on this device However, O'Neill rued de Jong's 85th-minute equaliser as the striker punished a spot of ball-watching from central defender Shane Duffy although the manager described the Blackburn man's overall performance in only his third cap as \"excellent.\" Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter appeared to do his chances of inclusion in O'Neill's Euro 2016 squad no harm as he was named man of the match after winning only his second cap. \"I think Harry did well, young (Stephen) Quinn did well also,\" added the Republic boss. Goalscorer Long was again bothered by a cut on his knee in Friday's game and O'Neill hinted that the Southampton striker may be rested in the final warm-up game against Belarus in Cork on Tuesday. Long's likely absence could see Republic record goalscorer Robbie Keane returning to the side for his 144th appearance.",
        "They were denied a win as Andre Ayew's deflected free-kick cancelled out Kelechi Iheanacho's close-range opener. The draw leaves them three points ahead of Manchester United, whose final game, against Bournemouth, was abandoned. City's vastly superior goal difference means United would need a 19-0 win over the Cherries to take fourth place. Listen to BBC Radio 5 live commentary of the goals In many ways, Manchester City's display at the Liberty Stadium was a fitting way to end an underwhelming season that began with such promise before limping to a satisfactory but below-par conclusion. Iheanacho - the on-field embodiment of a potentially exciting future - again demonstrated his sharpness in front of goal to poke home the opening goal after a Sergio Aguero shot had been saved in the fifth minute. It was the 19-year-old's 14th goal of the season and his eighth from his first 12 shots on target in the Premier League. But he and his side failed to build on it, missing numerous chances to put the game to bed, with the young forward and his usually lethal Argentine partner Aguero particularly wasteful. It left them vulnerable to a Swansea equaliser - which came courtesy of a 25-yard Ayew free-kick that deflected in off Fernando's head - and a potentially devastating second in a tense second half for the away side. In securing a top-four finish, Pellegrini has achieved the very minimum required of him before handing over to Pep Guardiola this summer, but it does not mask the failings of the Chilean's final campaign. Despite winning the League Cup for a second time in three years and going further in the Champions League than ever before, City's expensively assembled squad have underachieved in the league. Their haul of 66 points is their lowest in the top-flight since the 2008-09 season - the first under Sheikh Mansour's ownership. Pellegrini leaves the Etihad with a league title to his name, the best win percentage of any Premier League manager barring Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho and as the only City boss to have never finished below United. But after starting so strongly, his reign has limped to its conclusion with a squad in need of an overhaul. Media playback is not supported on this device In their previous two matches, Swansea had ended the top-four hopes of both Liverpool and West Ham. Despite resting goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, captain Ashley Williams and top scorer Gylfi Sigurdsson and being without Ki Sung-yueng because of his military service in South Korea, boss Francesco Guidolin came close to making it a hat-trick. Since the Italian joined the club in January, the Swans have improved significantly, losing only five of his 16 matches in charge. And they once again demonstrated their newly acquired stubbornness to extend their unbeaten home run to five games, during which they have conceded just twice. Having tied Guidolin down to a two-year deal this week, the Swans will be optimistic of building on this next season and avoiding the kind of poor form that prompted his arrival. Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin: \"I am happy because the moment was not simple in January [when he took over]. Now we have a comfortable position in the table. I am happy. I am proud. My players deserve this position because we have a good team.\" \"It was a good performance, a good result, against in my opinion he best team in the Premier League in terms of quality, a lot of big, big players. And the game was good, we played well. \"I am happy, now. Only this for us and our players. This is a good memory.\" Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini to BBC Sport: \"I wanted to win the Premier League this season, but the atmosphere from February when the club announced the new manager was maybe not the best atmosphere.

        "Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told an audience at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) that firearm officers needed greater public support. He also revealed that despite a push for more armed officers, there were not enough people willing to do the role. Sir Bernard is retiring after more than five and a half years in the post. During the speech, the Met's commissioner said public pressure on firearm officers had meant \"we simply don't have enough people now wanting to do these jobs.\" \"This a dangerous place to be.... we can't afford to have officers think twice because they fear the consequences of shooting someone.\" \"That's how they get shot or the public gets hurt or a criminal gets away with a gun,\" he said. Sir Bernard also stated that armed officers did not fire a shot at a suspect in more than 3,300 incidents involving firearms in 2016. \"It's an urban myth that officers are trigger-happy,\" he said. The Met has said it will increase firearm officer numbers by 600, with more than 400 extra staff trained or selected to date. According to a staff survey, nearly half of Met Police officers believe more officers should carry guns.",
        "It says increases will be needed if current trends in teacher recruitment and retention continue. Nevertheless, the STRB has recommended a pay rise of just 1 for teachers in England and Wales from this September. The rise applies to all leadership and teacher pay ranges and to allowances. Teachers' unions expressed disappointment at the 1 rise, saying it would do nothing to ease recruitment and retention issues. The STRB report said: \"For September 2016 we [...] recommend a 1 uplift to the minima and maxima of all classroom teacher pay ranges and leadership pay ranges in the national pay framework, and to classroom teacher allowances.\" But it went on to warn of a need for higher teacher salaries in the future. \"However, if current recruitment and retention trends continue, we expect an uplift to the pay framework significantly higher than 1 will be required in the course of this Parliament, to ensure an adequate supply of good teachers for schools in England and Wales,\" it said. \"Accordingly, we recommend the department and our consultees take steps to help schools prepare for such an eventuality. \"Given the budgetary context, this will require school leaders and governing bodies to be confident in both managing their workforce and in setting pay policies which enable differentiated performance-based awards to individuals, such that teachers and leaders can be appropriately rewarded within the available budget.\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \"The STRB is clear this is subject to the recruitment and retention evidence that the government is able to produce in relation to a future remit. \"At a national level we are retaining and recruiting the teachers we need with 15,000 more teachers in our classrooms than in 2010, and the number joining the profession outnumbering those who retire or leave. \"We recognised the recruitment challenges provided by a growing economy and regional demands and are investing over PS1.3bn up to 2020 to attract new teachers into the profession.\" But teachers' unions expressed dismay at the recommended 1 increase and accused the government of limiting teachers' pay. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT union, accused a \"hostile government\" of \"unnecessary and unjust pay restraint.\" \"Had the review body not been constrained by the arbitrary pay cap imposed by the government, there is no doubt that it would have been recommending a pay uplift higher than 1 for teachers,\" said Ms Keates. Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"The publication of this report and the Secretary of State's response are extremely late, having been delayed by government'purdah' periods for the London mayoral election and the EU referendum. \"This has left schools and teachers uncertain for far too long about the critical issue of pay awards. \"Even more disappointing, however, is that these pay awards are once again limited to an uplift of 1 when we are in the midst of a teacher recruitment crisis. \"Furthermore, schools are expected to fund these awards without any additional funding from the government at a time when budgets are under severe strain because of real-terms reductions.\" Kevin Courtney, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers said: \"The STRB, unlike the government, has recognised the mounting crisis in recruitment and retention. \"The NUT is hugely disappointed that the STRB decided to accept the 1 pay limit this year but strongly supports the STRB's view that the government must urgently find more money for schools to allow them to employ more and better-paid teachers.\" Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \"ATL welcomes the STRB's report which couldn't be clearer: there are increasing challenges in teacher recruitment and retention, and the Chancellor's imposed public sector pay limit of 1 is contributing to this. \"The next Prime Minister, their Chancellor and Secretary of State for Education must take heed of the review body's call for a future uplift'significantly higher' than 1 to address teacher recruitment and retention, improve teachers' working lives, and save the next generation's education.\" The STRB provides independent advice to the Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Education on school teachers' pay and conditions in England and Wales. Its latest recommendations come a day after thousands of lessons were cancelled across England because of a one-day strike by the National Union of Teachers.",

        "The Electoral Commission said 38 MPs had highlighted people, including students, claiming to have voted twice, which is a criminal offence. It said individual electoral registers run by councils should be better joined up to help identify duplicate entries. Labour warned against making it harder for young people to register to vote. A record number of 46.8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election, 500,000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46.4 million figure for the EU referendum. Of these, 68.7 actually voted on the day, the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997. There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline. In total, 2.9 million applications were received over the six-week period. Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10, including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury, Cambridge, Bristol West and Leeds Central. However, concerns over the number of duplicate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year's EU referendum - continue to persist. At the moment, there is no direct link between electoral registers, which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain, and the online registration service now used by a majority of people. The two systems use different databases and cannot communicate directly with each other. Between 1 December 2016 and the 22 May deadline, about 4.9 million applications to vote were submitted, the majority of them done online. But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1.4 million, suggesting \"a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been duplicates.\" With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered, the proportion of duplicate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30 and 70 in different areas. The watchdog said this had caused significant administration and financial burdens for electoral officials and should be addressed by clearer information on registration sites, including potentially a verification function which it said was used in Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland. Despite efforts to flag up to people that they did not need to register if they had been sent a poll card or had voted in May's local council elections, the watchdog said it appeared to have made little difference and urgent action was now needed. \"The relative ease of submitting an application to register to vote using the online service, in comparison to the difficult of contacting a local authority electoral services team by telephone or email to check if they were already registered, meant many people simply submitted another application,\" the report said. Although there was a lack of evidence to back up claims on social media that some people had voted twice, the watchdog said it took the issue very seriously and anyone with information should contact the police. It stressed that although some people - including students and those with second homes - may lawfully be able to register in more than one constituency and cast more than one vote in local elections, voting twice in a general election was an offence punishable by an unlimited fine. The \"dispersed and unconnected\" nature of the 381 electoral registers in Britain means it is not possible to collectively cross-check entries, the watchdog said, and being able to do so would significantly reduce the risk of double voting. It is also calling for people who are registered in two seats to choose in advance which one they will vote in at future general elections. Labour's shadow minister for voter engagement, Cat Smith, said voting twice was a serious offence and police needed to have the resources to prosecute people suspected of doing so. But she warned against a knee-jerk reaction, given the rise in registration and turnout, particularly among younger voters. \"A blanket ban on being registered at two addresses would exclude those who for reasons of work or study need to be registered in two places,\" she said. \"This cannot be an attempt to make it harder for young people and students to register to vote.\"",

It may be a poor substitute for Albert Square, but choose a character to dress up as and pop down the local market to pick your outfit. Will it be Whitney, will it be Max, will it be Ian? Whoever you pick, gold hoop earnings, plastic leather jackets, fake fur and tracksuits could be on the shopping list. You won't go far wrong with a chef's apron either. Fill your basket with cheap crisps, sweets and drinks. You may not be on first name terms with the cashier, or get into a row while you're in there, but if you try really hard you may just believe you're in the Minute Mart. For the main course, it's just got to be fish and chips. In honour of the Beale family, make it plaice. Make your guests really feel like they're stepping into Albert Square. A street sign on the front door, framed pictures of the cast around the room and the EastEnders theme tune on a loop would certainly help set the mood. If you really want to push the boat out, why not create your own Queen Vic, complete with a bar, a royal sculpture and a licence above the door? No Who Killed Lucy Beale party would be complete without some sort of competition to guess who the culprit actually is. Whoever gets the killer right, gets the prize. Yay! Sure, this may just be a bit of fun but at the heart of all this is the loss of a young woman's life (sort of). Yes, she had a history of causing trouble and getting up people's noses, but do take a minute to remember Lucy Beale. RIP Lucy, never forgotten. We are in no way condoning physical violence, but come on, no EastEnders event would be complete without a bit of a verbal bust up. After the big reveal, just let all that vent up frustration out of your system. Frowning all night and generally being a bit glum could also help you get in the mood. Have fun! In true EastEnders style, after the party, head to a trendy club around the corner. Ideally, you'll know practically everyone in there and the music will be so quiet you'll hear what the bloke at the end of the bar is saying. You'll probably get into a row with whoever's serving the drinks as well. Now you're really getting into the spirit of it. If you're nursing a sore head the next morning after all that \"loud music,\" get down to your local greasy spoon for a fry up. And hopefully it will stop you feeling like this...

        "The 20-year-old England international passed a medical and agreed personal terms with the club on Thursday in a deal reported to be worth PS20m. Henderson, the club's first summer signing, signed what Liverpool described as'a long-term deal'. \"I'm over the moon, overjoyed to be here and I'm really looking forward to it,\" Henderson told the Liverpool website. \"Obviously it's hard to leave your local club. I'm a Sunderland lad, I've supported them all my life. \"But I'm really looking forward to the future now and obviously this is a massive opportunity for me. I'm really excited by it.\" Steven Gerrard is one of the best players in the world, you want to be playing with him and training with him to try and improve yourself as a player The midfielder, whose one and only cap for England came last November against France, has now joined the England Under-21 squad in Denmark ahead of the European Championship. The Black Cats had rejected Liverpool's previous offer for the player, which was thought to be worth PS16m. Striker David Ngog, 22, could move in the opposite direction as part of the deal, but that is yet to be confirmed. Henderson will provide competition in the Reds' midfield, which already boasts internationals Steven Gerrard, Lucas Leiva, Raul Meireles and Christian Poulsen. \"Coming to a massive club like Liverpool, there is always going to be competition,\" added Henderson. \"Hopefully I can keep working hard, keep improving, and get my chance on the pitch. \" (Gerrard) is one of the best players in the world, you want to be playing with him and training with him to try and improve yourself as a player. Hopefully I can learn a lot from him.\" Reds director of football Damien Comolli said of the deal: \"I'm very pleased because he was one of the targets we had and when you get your first target it's always a good sign because you think the others will come through as well. \"He has got all the skills technically that we needed,\" he added. \"He's good with the ball, he's creative, he's got good passing, he's physically very good. \"That's everything we wanted in a midfielder and he's versatile as well. For manager Kenny Dalglish he will be the player we wanted.\" The Sunderland-born Henderson, who had a loan spell at Coventry City early in his career, signed a five-year contract at the Stadium of Light in April 2010. He came to prominence as Steve Bruce's Black Cats made a fine start to the season and was rewarded with an England call-up by coach Fabio Capello. And though his form dipped as Sunderland struggled in the second half of the campaign, Henderson is still regarded as one of England's brightest young prospects. Manchester United had been regarded as the long-time favourites to sign Henderson after he made an outstanding start to last season, but their interest cooled and manager Sir Alex Ferguson has moved on to other midfield targets.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device Spirit of Shankly (SOS) will vote on the issue on Saturday. Its chair, Jay McKenna, said the impact of the Hillsborough disaster might have left fans \"behind the curve\" in the debate about reintroducing standing. The club said it would \"listen\" to fans' views if legislation requiring all-seater stadiums were ever changed. Liverpool said their fans were in a \"uniquely complex and difficult position\" when contemplating safe standing because the requirement for all-seater stadiums in England's top flight came in response to the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 fans were killed in a crush at an FA Cup semi-final in 1989. SOS has discussed the issue with members since September and on Tuesday will meet with survivors of the disaster and families of those killed. It will hold an open meeting in the city this weekend, then open an online vote. The vote will seek to clarify an official stance on safe standing for the group's members but a separate vote will also collate the views of non-members in order to build a supporter-wide consensus. \"We think it's important that everybody has a say,\" added McKenna. \"It can be a factual and emotional debate. We are fully aware of that. In the past nobody has wanted to talk about it, perhaps for fear of upsetting people. If we don't have this conversation, it will happen around us. \"We just want to know, are you in favour of it or not?\" Government legislation would need to change for safe standing to be introduced. The Premier League wrote to its 20 clubs last month to assess whether they would be interested in trialling safe standing. Debate over the issue has grown since Celtic introduced around 3,000 rail seats at Celtic Park at the beginning of last season. The Scottish club will be represented at Saturday's open SOS meeting, as will the Sports Ground Safety Authority, who oversaw regulation surrounding the move to all-seater stadiums. But Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, which helps families of more than 70 of those killed at Hillsborough, reiterated the body's objection to safe standing. \"We have had a vote not so long ago with the families and they voted against any form of standing whatsoever,\" she said. \"We don't call it safe standing we call it unsafe standing.\" A separate organisation - the Hillsborough Justice Campaign - said it remained \"neutral\" on any move to safe standing but chair Kenny Derbyshire said it was now \"imperative\" people had their say. In April 2016, inquests concluded the 96 people who died as a result of Hillsborough were unlawfully killed. In June, it was announced six senior figures will face charges for the disaster.",

The researchers will apply a systematic approach and employ the latest advances in genetic testing, aiming to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals. \"There have been DNA tests done on alleged yetis and other such things but since then the testing techniques, particularly on hair, have improved a lot due to advances in forensic science,\" the Oxford geneticist told Reuters news agency. Modern testing could get valid results from a fragment of a shaft of hair, added Prof Sykes, who is leading the project with Michel Sartori, director of the Lausanne Museum of Zoology. A 1951 expedition to Mount Everest famously returned with photographs of giant footprints in the snow, fuelling speculation about giant Himalayan creatures, unknown to science. Since then, many eye-witness reports of such creatures have emerged from remote regions of the world. These humanoid beasties are variously known as the \"yeti\" or \"migoi\" in the Himalayas, \"bigfoot\" or \"sasquatch\" in North America, \"almasty\" in the Caucasus mountains and \"orang pendek\" in Sumatra, but there are many others. Tests up to now have usually concluded that alleged yeti remains were in fact human. But, said Prof Sykes, \"there has been no systematic review of this material.\" The project will focus on an archive of remains held at the Lausanne museum that was assembled by Bernard Heuvelmans, a Belgian-French biologist who investigated reported yeti sightings from 1950 up to his death in 2001. Other institutions and individuals will also be asked to send in details of any possible yeti material. Aside from the yeti question, Prof Sykes said he hoped the project would add to the growing body of knowledge on the interaction between different human species in the past. \"In the last two years it has become clear that there was considerable interbreeding between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals.... about 2 to 4 of the DNA of each individual European is Neanderthal,\" he said. Those who are favourable to the idea of as-yet undescribed creatures say the yeti and orang pendek could represent survivals of Homo erectus, Homo floresiensis (the Indonesian \"Hobbit or Gigantopithecus - a giant ape that once inhabited the forests of East Asia. The idea has even spawned the term \"cryptozoology\" to describe the search for such beasts. Others are highly sceptical of such tales, and consider the subject unworthy of serious scientific investigation. Asked about the project's chances of success, Prof Sykes said: \"The answer is, of course, I don't know,\" adding, \"it's unlikely, but on the other hand if we don't examine it we won't know.\"",
        "The fine follows the conviction of former RBS trader, Shirlina Tsang, for fraud last year. She was sentenced to 50 months in prison after being caught falsifying records of emerging markets trades. Hong Kong regulators said RBS's controls were \"seriously inadequate.\" The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) also said there were \"significant weaknesses in its procedures, management systems and internal controls.\" But the regulator said the fine took into account the bank's speedy action in alerting the authorities once it had discovered the illegal trades, which took place in its emerging markets rates business in 2011. \"This deserves substantial credit and is the reason why today's sanctions are not heavier ones,\" Mark Steward, the SFC's head of enforcement, said in a statement. RBS responded with a statement, reading: \"We put in place a comprehensive remediation programme that strengthened our governance and supervisory oversight, and our control environment.\" The fine is relatively small compared to others the bank has received in the last few years. In December RBS agreed to pay 391m euros (PS320m) in penalties to the European Commission for its role in the attempted rigging of Yen Libor and Euribor - the Tokyo and euro equivalents of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. In the same month it was fined 100m (PS60m) by US regulators for violations of US sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Burma, and Cuba. The bank was found to have removed location information on payments made to US financial institutions from countries such as Iran and Cuba.",

        "The Test was as good as saved. Needing to bat through the day, England had all 10 wickets in hand at lunch and were 103-0 soon after. That they ended 207 all out, losing by an innings and 75 runs, was gut-wrenching. It rendered all the talk of fight, spirit and character that we have heard from within the camp as worthless. Was it Alastair Cook's fault that England lost in that way? Absolutely not. He actually batted very nicely to get England through the morning session, only to be let down by the majority of team. However, when you have presided over something so cataclysmic in sport terms as that, then it is only natural that both Cook and the powers that be in English cricket may be thinking differently about his future as captain than they were at the start of the match. Going back to how the speculation about Cook's future began - a story at the start of the tour where he said he was looking forward to not being captain - I believe he simply gave an honest answer to a question he was asked. The truth is that England do not appoint captains forever. Cook and director of cricket Andrew Strauss do meet for debriefs at the end of every series. The captaincy is regularly reviewed. However, Cook's candid comments gained more attention because it was quite widely known that he was nearer the end of his tenure than the beginning. Before this final-Test defeat, it was quite likely Cook's future was largely in his own hands. I still suspect part of the England hierarchy will want him to stay on for next winter's Ashes series, but it might also be that the likes of Strauss and the rest of the management team feel they have to draw the line now. As for Cook, if he was feeling bullish about his future as skipper, he may not be any longer. He is probably coming to the realisation the decision on the captaincy may not be as much in his hands as he thought. Indeed, everyone involved could reach the conclusion it is the right time to make a change, so that new energy, focus and direction is brought to the job. There is sense in that. If Cook either resigns or is sacked, then the players in his team must share the responsibility. I have said previously that, even although England were expected to lose this series, we wanted to see improvement in individual players who were leaving with new skills that would have made the trip worthwhile. When you see a collapse like the one in Chennai, you wonder how much has been learned. In that respect Moeen Ali, as just one example, will have the finger pointed at him for an awful stroke that began England's ultimate demise. With runs not even in the equation, he skipped down the pitch at Ravindra Jadeja and was caught at mid-on. It was completely reckless, and beyond me to explain what he was trying to achieve. That is not a personal attack on Moeen, but merely an example that highlights how England have not just failed to take their chances, they have actually given them away. We knew how difficult this assignment would be. Seven back-to-back Tests in Bangladesh and India is the hardest tour England have ever had; it has been relentless. We also knew England would probably lose, mainly because their spinners are not of the same quality as India's. But that does not excuse the familiar batting collapses or the regular missed chances in the field. Again, the blame for those cannot all be laid at Cook's door. And so we wait for a decision on his future. There are three one-day internationals and three Twenty20s after Christmas, but they are not likely to deflect attention from speculation over the biggest job in English cricket. If Cook does go, Joe Root is the natural candidate to replace him. At 25, it may be a year earlier than England would have liked him to take the job, but he has risen to every challenge put in front of him so far. Whatever happens, Cook will remain the object of a tremendous amount of goodwill and respect. I doubt there would be any problems with him returning to the ranks. England will want him to score lots of runs for a number of years to come and I would expect him to do just that. Jonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt",
        "El Mundo said it had original ledger entries handwritten by the former treasurer of the governing Popular Party (PP), Luis Barcenas. It said it had delivered the documents to the High Court. Mr Rajoy and other PP members have repeatedly denied that they received illegal payments. Another Spanish paper, El Pais, published similar documents earlier this year. It is claimed that Mr Barcenas ran a PP slush fund that took donations from construction magnates and distributed them to party leaders in cash. Mr Barcenas is in custody facing trial for corruption and tax fraud. He denies the allegations. However, in an interview published in El Mundo on Sunday, Mr Barcenas for the first time admitted that the handwriting in the ledger was his. He added that the photocopies originally published by El Pais were a fraction of the documents he had in his possession. El Mundo said the documents it had seen showed that Mr Rajoy received payments in 1997, 1998 and 1999 when he was a minister in the government of Jose Maria Aznar. They included, it said, two payments to Mr Rajoy of 2.1m pesetas (12,600 euros; PS11,000) in 1998. The alleged payments are said to have been undeclared and untaxed. Spanish opposition leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba in February called on Mariano Rajoy to resign over the allegations. \"The Luis Barcenas originals published by El Mundo today pulverise the alibi used until now by the PP to deny the authenticity of its ex-treasurer's papers,\" El Mundo said. The PP responded with a statement saying: \"The Popular Party reiterates that it does not know of the notes nor their content, and it does not in any way recognise them as the accounts of this political organisation.\" This is another twist in possibly the most important corruption scandal to hit modern Spanish politics, says the BBC's Tom Burridge in Madrid. The allegations have caused anger among Spaniards already suffering a deep and long recession and biting austerity cuts.",

        "Media playback is not supported on this device An early Zak Jules own goal got Dee started but Louis Moult soon levelled. The Well defence then went missing, with a Marcus Haber double and goals from Mark O'Hara and Craig Wighton making it 5-1 at half time. The home side went close through Craig Clay and Chris Cadden but were unable to reduce the deficit. In their three previous games, Well lost 3-0 to Hearts, 7-2 at Aberdeen and 2-0 at Celtic, while Dundee's victory was their second in succession following the 2-1 triumph over Rangers. The result was the biggest away win of the season in the Premiership and means Dundee remain in sixth spot, with Well now just two points clear of second-bottom Inverness Caledonian Thistle. On-loan Reading defender Jules was in for the injured Stephen McManus and he made an early impact, although not one he would have wanted. It was a simple high ball into the box but Jules got his footing all wrong and looped a header over the advancing Craig Samson and into the net. Moult's equaliser came midway through the half as he reacted quickest in the box to shoot low past Scott Bain from close range. The visitors were moving the ball around efficiently and they were back in front when Haber fired a right-foot shot across Samson into the bottom right hand corner of the net. Mark O'Hara finished the third after excellent build-up play before former Well favourite Henrik Ojamaa set up Wighton to blast in number four. Paul McGowan then curled an effort inches wide of Samson's left hand post as confidence flowed through Paul Hartley's Dundee dominant outfit. With seconds remaining in the first half, a Wighton free-kick from the left found Haber totally unmarked at the back post and he duly nodded in the fifth for Dundee. As the half time whistle blew the home fans' boos rung out around the stadium. Media playback is not supported on this device Dundee had not recorded an away win since the end of October, but Lanarkshire is clearly lucky for the Dens Park men as that triumph in October came at Hamilton. Despite the four-goal deficit Motherwell returned for the second half with the same personnel and made a better impression, albeit against a Dundee side who had taken their foot off the gas. Well's Craig Clay had two good efforts but Bain was up to the task, while Ojamaa had a couple of pot shots at the other end with no joy. The home fans were furious at the end of the match as Motherwell face up to a relegation battle. Dundee boss Paul Hartley: \"The first half we won the game with some outstanding play and goals, and carried it on from last week. \"We told them at half time to make sure we don't concede any goals. In the second half we didn't pass it as well and sometimes that happens when you have such a commanding lead, but overall the players were outstanding. \"We worked a little bit in the week about getting balls to the back to (Mark) O'Hara and (Marcus) Haber and that managed to pay off today, but the overall team performance was excellent.\" Match ends, Motherwell 1, Dundee 5.

        "In December, the government announced finalised plans for a cull, initially in pilot areas, as a way to curb the spread of tuberculosis in cattle. In applying for judicial review, the Badger Trust says culling will not stop TB and may in fact help spread it. Other campaign groups are considering action under the Bern Convention, which protects European wildlife. The government's plans are likely to result in farmers funding contractors to shoot badgers in a number of areas of England, with two initial pilots in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset taking place later this year. \"We have identified some serious flaws in the way by which the Secretary of State [Caroline Spelman] reached her decision to cull badgers,\" said Gwendolen Morgan of Bindmans solicitors, lawyer for the Badger Trust. \"Given that Defra's proposals come at an enormous cost to farmers, and threaten to prompt rather than prevent the spread of disease, we hope that this ill-conceived decision will be struck down by the court.\" She pointed to government projections that culling would reduce TB incidence by 12-16 over nine years. TheProtection of Badgers Actsays licences to kill can be granted for \"preventing the spread of disease\" - and the trust argues that the slow-down in the rate of increase, or \"reduction in new incidence,\" projected by Defra does not qualify as \"prevention.\" The government's plan involves having Natural England issue culling licences. The Badger Trust says the guidance given to Natural England is unlawful. Potentially the most important element of its case concerns the methods used to kill badgers. In the landmark UK study, the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), badgers were trapped before being shot. However, the government plans to allow licensed contractors to shoot badgers as they roam - \"free shooting\" - which is likely to be less efficient and to increase disruption of badger families. The RBCT showed that when badger's social groups are disrupted, they roam further, carrying the TB bacterium to more farms. For this reason, the trust argues that after the pilots, farmers may be forced to resort to trap-and-shoot, because free shooting will either prove ineffective or a hazard to public safety. That would escalate the cost by anything up to a factor of 10 - and the Badger Trust says this possibility damages the government's economic case for a cull. As the majority of new cases arise through infection from other cattle rather than from badgers, the trust says the government should simply invest in stricter cattle control measures. Regulations on farmers were recently tightened and testing regimes intensified - but the National Farmers' Union, the government and other proponents believe culling is needed in badly affected areas in addition to existing measures. In 2010, 25,000 cattle were slaughtered as a result of TB infection, and the disease is costing the UK taxpayer in the region of PS100m per year. They also argue that culling would in the end benefit badgers, as TB infection is seriously debilitating to them. \"Nobody wants to see badgers culled, but no country in the world where wildlife carries TB has successfully controlled the disease in cattle without tackling its presence in wildlife as well,\" said a Defra spokeswoman. \"Unless further action is taken now, it will continue to get worse.\" Badgers are protected under UK law, and also under the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. Campaigners are also considering using this as another weapon to use in the long-running battle over culling. Last year, wildlife groups began programmes of vaccination, and some animal groups believe this will in the end remove any need for culling. The Welsh Assembly Government is due to announce its decision on a proposed pilot cull in West Wales early this year. Follow Richardon Twitter",

        "Her decision was linked to a French inquiry into claims that her centrist MoDem party wrongly used EU funds to pay party workers. She is a former MEP. Her party is allied to the president's La Republique en Marche (LREM) party. Ms Goulard is the second leading figure in President Emmanuel Macron's cabinet to leave ahead of a reshuffle. One of the president's closest confidants, Richard Ferrand, announced his resignation from the cabinet on Monday after becoming ensnared in allegations that he had used insider information to secure a lucrative property deal for his wife while he was head of a mutual health insurance fund. While both ministers have denied any wrongdoing, their cases threatened to overshadow a president who ran on a ticket of fighting political sleaze. Mr Macron has already announced details of his bill to clean up politics, which involves stopping politicians hiring members of their own family, a ban of up to 10 years for MPs and senators convicted of corruption or fraud, and reform of party financing. The man who presented the proposals is MoDem leader Francois Bayrou, the justice minister whose party won 42 seats in Sunday's elections in areas that went uncontested by LREM. Mr Macron's party secured a majority in parliament with 308 of the 577 seats. In a statement, Ms Goulard said that the president's commitment to restoring confidence in public office \"must take precedence over any personal considerations.\" As the inquiry continued, she wanted to be in a position to show her \"good faith,\" she said. The president's allies have voiced confidence in Mr Bayrou, despite the embarrassment of the fake jobs inquiry. \"Mr Bayrou is destined to stay in the government,\" said Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. The justice minister refused to comment on Ms Goulard's resignation on Tuesday, describing it as a personal decision. He has also insisted that party workers have never taken on fake jobs as assistants to MoDem MEPs in the European Parliament. Many saw the president's hand in Ms Goulard's resignation, reports the BBC's Hugh Schofield. She was one of five women given top jobs in the Macron cabinet last month and accompanied the president on his visit to Mali last month, his first trip outside Europe. Doubts have also been raised about the future of another MoDem politician, European Affairs Minister Marielle de Sarnez. Like Ms Goulard, she is part of the Paris prosecutor's inquiry.",
        "Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Denbighshire, was closed more than three years ago and a report found some patients were treated like animals. It has emerged that at least seven patients' families were told treatment may have contributed to their deaths. Betsi Cadwaladr health board said an investigation was under way. It acknowledged the quality of care provided could have been a contributory factor to the deaths of some patients. A review of mortality rates on the ward has never been published although it is understood it has been completed. Relatives of one patient told BBC Wales Today they were told medical care on the ward was inadequate. Correspondence seen by the programme included an apology from the health board to the family, who do not want to be identified. One letter said: \"Experts found that there were problems in the health care which may have contributed to the death.\" It added that \"the board is very much engaged in a thorough search for the truth about the Tawel Fan ward.\" But the family were unconvinced lessons had been learned and said questions remained unanswered and, as far as they were aware, nobody had lost their job, let alone be prosecuted. The scandal of Tawel Fan pushed the already troubled health board into close supervision by the Welsh Government. It remains in special measures which costs PS5m a year. An initial report into what happened at Tawel Fan was published almost three years ago. Two more reports are due later this year.

        "There is a general belief here that if you typed Ghana or Ghanaian into a search engine, the words that would be suggested automatically as a follow-up should be politics and football. It is these two subjects that spark animated discussions and get the juices flowing. Even though in football, we have not won anything on the continental or world stage for a very long time, we still believe that the Black Stars, our national team, are special. One of the inner sources of the strength that help Ghanaians survive is the fact that our national team regularly beats the national team of the United States at football. Trying to get a visa from Ghana to the United States is one of the most humiliating experiences for Ghanaians. But we are able to endure it all by simply repeating over and over again under our breaths: \"World Cup 2006, we defeated you, World Cup 2010, we defeated you.\" Now, we discovered quite unexpectedly that defeating the US at football has even deeper implications, when news broke that our government had accepted two Yemeni ex-detainees, Khalid al-Dhuby and Mahmoud Omar Bin Atef, from Guantanamo Bay, where the US detains terror suspects, to live in Ghana. Elizabeth Ohene: \"They are excited to come to Ghana because of Asamoah Gyan, the captain of the Black Star - they know him and they like him very much\" The government has struggled to explain this decision. We have been told the two men pose no danger whatsoever to Ghana; they were innocent 20-year-olds when they were arrested and to drive home their innocence, our president compares them to his own 20-year-old son. We have been told that even though the two men are such thoroughly harmless and nice people, their every move will be monitored. Normally taciturn officials from the US embassy are suddenly all over the radio and television trying to assure us we should all be proud of our government for bringing to Ghana men the US Senate deems too dangerous to enter their country. When none of these interventions appeared to be calming the protests, the two thoroughly harmless and nice men were brought out to state their own case on national radio. Guantanamo Bay prison: The pair said they do not belong to any terrorist group, and have been wrongly arrested for 14 years without any charge. They have suffered but are not looking for revenge. They want to live in Ghana quietly and peacefully, and put their lives together. All that did not sound very convincing to any of us here; what everybody really wanted to know was why they had been brought to Ghana - did they just pick us on the map because Ghana happens to be the physical centre of the world? And suddenly it all comes tumbling out. They are excited to come to Ghana because of Asamoah Gyan, the captain of the Black Stars, they know him and they like him very much. A lot of the detainees like Ghanaians very much, and during the 2010 World Cup, most of the people there in Guantanamo Bay - no, not most of them, all of them - were with Ghana and when the Black Stars beat America, they were very happy. So now we know.... beating America at football has consequences. I am afraid I don't know what happened to our secret supporters in Guantanamo in 2014.

        "Kostadin Kostov, 42, is accused of murdering 38-year-old Gergana Prodanova, who was last seen in Exeter. She was reported missing on 8 August by work colleagues when she failed to turn up for work. Kostov is due to appear at Exeter Magistrates Court on Monday. Police said inquiries were ongoing and extensive searches were continuing in the Mount Pleasant area of Exeter. Devon and Cornwall Police said following the disappearance and the subsequent launch of a murder investigation a team of search officers are continuing their efforts to trace Gergana Prodanova. The force said around 30 officers are conducting house-to-house enquiries, as well as using the police helicopter, drone, and support from specially trained dogs. Officers said around 2,000 properties in the Mount Pleasant area of Exeter have been visited by police. Det Supt Paul Burgan said: \"Her family in Bulgaria need to know what has happened to her, especially her three children. \"While we have a huge team searching for Gergana we also need the public to help and this is a plea for our community to search their outbuildings for any sign of Gergana.\"",
        "Two-year-old Mandarin Princess, trained by Charlie McBride, was declared winner of Thursday's 13:40 race at Great Yarmouth after beating Fyre Cay. But a scan afterwards identified the horse as three-year-old stablemate Millie's Kiss, who had been due to run in a later race at the same course. \"It's an honest error and no-one stood to gain anything by it,\" said McBride. Stewards referred the matter to the British Horseracing Authority (BHA). The result officially stands for betting purposes, but some bookmakers have said they will pay out on the horses finishing first and second. McBride told the Racing Post he did not notice it was the wrong horse because he was \"stressed and rushing\" after being delayed collecting the saddle. \"I took a young girl who has been with me for two or three months to the races - she's ridden both fillies and knows them both,\" he said. \"After we checked them in we got some lunch and I sent her to get the two-year-old ready and I went to the weighing room to get the saddle. \"I like to weigh my horses out early but I had to wait over 20 minutes for the saddle. \"The filly was already out when I got back and as I was stressed and rushing I didn't look that closely - I just assumed it was the right horse.\" The BHA described the incident as \"unprecedented\" since a microchipping identification system for horses was introduced in 1999. It said: \"The scan identified the horse to be Millie's Kiss, the trainer's other runner in race four. \"They (the stewards) interviewed the trainer, the stable groom, the veterinary officer and the equine welfare integrity officer responsible for the sampling unit. \"Having heard their evidence they referred the matter to the head office of the British Horseracing Authority and ordered Millie's Kiss to be withdrawn from race four.\" Millie's Kiss had been due to run for Newmarket trainer McBride in the 15:15 race. The responsibility lies with the trainer to present and run the correct horse in the race. Stipendiary steward Tony McGlone told At The Races all horses are scanned before they are brought into their stables at the course. \"We sent the horse for routine testing as normal and the veterinary officer scanned the horse and found it to be the incorrect horse,\" he said. Punter Nicholas Quinn said the controversy had left racegoers bemused. \"This looks very bad for British racing. The one thing you shouldn't have to hope for is that the right horse is in the right race,\" he said. John Egan, who rode the'winner', said he was surprised the horse was not disqualified or the race declared void. \"At the end of the day, we're all human. Mistakes happen. I feel most sorry for Charlie,\" he said. John Mear, a member of the Four Winds Racing Partnership that own Millie's Kiss, said they were \"shocked and upset\" for the trainer. \"It's nothing untoward. He's just made a genuine mistake. He must be absolutely heartbroken,\" he said. \"The issue had not been established until after the result had been made official. After the weighed in has been declared on the racecourse, the result cannot be amended by the stewards. \"The responsibility lies with the trainer to present and run the correct horse in the race. \"Having said that, and while we have not seen an incident of this nature in recent times, we will of course determine what steps need to be put in place to prevent it from happening again. We sympathise with the betting operators and betting public who have potentially been affected by this incident.\" BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght Though this may read like something out of a Dick Francis novel, sources at the British Horseracing Authority are indicating this looks more like a cock-up than anything else. Both horses are bay coloured fillies, and the BHA will seek to find out how they were confused by Charlie McBride andor his staff; whatever, McBride is looking at a substantial fine. All horses are microchipped so they can be checked on arrival at the track, but, after this, a second ID check, probably in the paddock before the race, is likely to be brought in.",

        "In 2013 a working group, set up by the Scottish government, recommended eligible couples should be offered up to three treatments. But that would only be after health boards had reduced IVF waiting times. Infertility Network UK said it was a \"no-brainer\" there should now be three cycles as waiting times have fallen. New IVF criteria was introduced in July 2013, following recommendations by the National Infertility Working Group. The changes were designed to standardise fertility treatment across Scotland to prevent a \"postcode lottery.\" Giving evidence to Holyrood's health committee, the charity's chief executive Susan Seenan said: \"The group recommended three cycles and said that once the waiting times were down to below 12 months, at the latest early 2015, they would consider moving to three cycles. \"It just doesn't seem to be happening as fast as we would like it to. \"We just think now that the waiting times are down, that it is a no-brainer - we should move to offering everybody who is eligible three cycles.\" Susan Seenan added: \"Everybody in the group was agreed that...three cycles was the best possible way to move forward for patients. \"Why anybody would not want to move forward with that, I have no idea, unless it is finance related.\" A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said Scotland was \"leading the way\" in the provision of NHS IVF treatment, with PS12m of investment over the last three years. She said the number of IVF cycles that couples were entitled to was under review. The spokeswoman added: \"The reconvened expert group has met twice and its review will consider a range of issues, including the number of IVF cycles, to ensure access to IVF treatments remains fair, reliable and timely. \"The views of patients and our stakeholders, including Infertility Network Scotland who are part of the Infertility Group, will be instrumental to this process, along with data collection and modelling.\" Fertility treatment is currently available to those under 40, and is not offered to women who are obese. In addition, couples need to have been in a stable relationship for two years and neither partner can smoke for three months before treatment begins. Both partners also need to be methadone-free for a year before IVF starts. Women aged between 40 and 42 are eligible for one cycle of fertility treatment if they have never previously undergone the procedure.",

        "The report warns that a failure to reintegrate returnees may lead to further radicalisation. Somalia's Islamist al-Shabab militants are believed to be recruiting heavily in neighbouring north-eastern Kenya. Kenya has seen a series of militant attacks with one at a university earlier this year killed 148 people. Although the report does not mention where the returnees came from, Deputy Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (Supkem) Hassan Ole Nadu has confirmed to the BBC that they were fighting for al-Shabab. The 36-page report was compiled by the IOM, Supkem and the Kenya's interior ministry. Researchers found that although most adults joined the group voluntarily, nearly a third of children interviewed said they were forced to enlist. The return of the youth, the report says, provides both \"opportunities and threats for and to Kenyans.\" \"On the one hand, they present an opportunity to counter the radicalising ideologies and recruitment strategies of armed groups,\" the report says. \"On the other, the response of the security forces is widely perceived to be promoting further radicalisation as the returnees themselves believe that they are unsafe and have limited reintegration options.\" Security in the country was identified by participants as the main obstacle to their successful reintegration in the country. A total of 185 respondents were interviewed, representing nearly 30 of the estimated total of 684 returnees in the country. The majority were between 18 and 34 years old.",
        "He made the pledge in a Ramadan message to Muslims, who have been worst affected by the ban. The government shut 13 Somalia-linked firms in April, saying it wanted to prevent militant Islamists from using them to finance attacks. Kenyans Somalis accused the government of blanket punishment. Somalis around the world rely heavily on the firms to do business and send cash to relatives in Somalia, where the banking sector is almost non-existent. Mr Kenyatta, in his message to mark the Islamic holy month, said he had noted proposals to lift the ban on the firms. He had therefore directed the central bank to \"immediately issue comprehensive regulations\" for the activities of the firms, \"upon which their suspension would be lifted.\" The ban was imposed after Somali militant Islamist group al-Shabab killed 148 people in an attack on Garissa University College in north-eastern Kenya. There has been a similar crackdown on the companies in the UK and US where the governments have adopted strict money-laundering laws making it difficult for banks to deal with them. The United Nations estimates that Somalis in the diaspora, almost all of whom are Muslim, send home about 1.6bn (PS1.1bn) annually, significantly more than foreign aid. More than 40 of Somalis receive remittances, the bulk of which are used for basic needs, including food, clothes, medicine and education, according to a UN survey. Somalia has not had a functioning government since the fall of Siad Barre's government in 1991, and has been beset by religious and clan conflicts.",
        "They say 40 of coral has died at the Dongsha Atoll in the South China Sea. Nothing as severe has happened on Dongsha for at least 40 years, according to experts. Anne Cohen of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, US, said the high water temperatures of 201516 were devastating for reef systems globally, including Dongsha. Coral bleaching - where corals turn white and may die - was the worst on record for Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef in 2016. The barrier reef has absorbed a lot of the attention, but other reefs around the world were also severely affected, said Dr Cohen. \"The 20152016 El Nino was devastating for reef systems in other parts of the world as well, including Dongsha Atoll and reefs in the central Pacific, where some of the most pristine coral reefs are located and of course, the US Pacific Remote Marine National Monument,\" she said. \"We observed devastating bleaching in that area as well.\" Only last week, scientists published observations of three major die-offs of coral at the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, 2002 and 1998. They concluded that the only way to preserve the world's coral reefs is to take drastic action to reduce global warming. The study of the Dongsha Atoll, reported in the journal, Scientific Reports, echoes this finding. \"Based on what we observed on Dongsha, a 2 degree cap on ocean warming may not be enough to save coral reefs,\" Dr Cohen told BBC News. \"This is because coral reefs are shallow water ecosystems and a tweak in the local weather can turn that 2 degrees Celsius into a 6 degrees Celsius warming.\" The Dongsha Atoll, located in the South China Sea, near south-eastern China and the Philippines, is rich in marine life and is regarded as one of the world's most important coral reefs. The researchers said on its own, a 2 degrees Celsius rise in temperatures was unlikely to cause widespread damage to coral reefs in the region. But, a high-pressure system caused temperatures to spike to 6 degrees, leading to the death of 40 of coral over the course of six weeks. They argue that predictions of the future of coral reefs may be \"overly optimistic\" for some reefs in shallow water. Bleaching happens when high water temperatures cause corals to expel the algae they depend upon. The Australian government confirmed in March that widespread coral bleaching is happening on the Great Barrier Reef for the fourth time in history. Follow Helen on Twitter.",
        "The idea will be looked at as part of a wider study of transport issues across southern Scotland. Campaign for Border Rail spokesman Simon Walton said they would have preferred a report looking solely at rail services in the area. However, he said it was welcome progress nonetheless. Transport Scotland announced earlier this week that it intended to award the contract to look at wider transport issues across the south of the country to Jacobs UK Ltd. It is hoped the study can get under way later this month and will take about seven months to complete. Mr Walton said it was good to see the CBR's case for extending the railway was being recognised. \"It is a first step if not exactly a giant leap - it is certainly a move in the right direction,\" he said. \"We at the CBR would have been happier with a feasibility study looking solely at railway extension but this is a positive move. \"It does back our findings that it makes sense locally, socially and strategically to take the railway through Hawick and on to Carlisle.\"",
        "But the original timescale, which envisaged the closures taking place by the end of 2015, has slipped. Calls have been made by Opposition MSPs for the work on the reorganisation to be postponed pending a review of the way calls to police are handled. The review, by HM Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland (HMICS), is due to report in October. The closure of the Aberdeen control room was originally scheduled to be completed the previous month. But a north-east MSP has said the programme, which has already seen control rooms in Dumfries, Stirling and Glenrothes closed, should be halted until the HMICS review is published. It was ordered following the deaths of two people in a car crash on the M9 in Stirlingshire on July 6, and will examine the case for shutting regional control centres. Although the incident was reported to police at the time, officers only attended the scene three days later after a second call from a different person. John Yuill, 28, was found dead and 25-year-old Lamara Bell critically injured. She later died in hospital from injuries including broken bones and kidney damage caused by dehydration. The initial call had been handled by the Bilston Glen call centre which takes calls from Central Scotland and Fife following the closure of Stirling and Glenrothes. Lewis Macdonald, Labour MSP for north-east Scotland said the programme of closures - which has already seen a number of skilled staff leaving Aberdeen - should be halted by police until after HMICS has reported. He said: \"It would be absolutely unacceptable for them to continue with the closure plans while the decision is being looked at and while the future delivery of police control rooms across Scotland is under review. \"So I hope that we will hear from Police Scotland very, very shortly to the effect that they will take no steps leading to the closure of the Aberdeen control room, the service centre which answers 101 calls in Aberdeen or indeed the control room in Inverness. \"Because it is quite clear the local knowledge that is accumulated in these control rooms cannot be replicated, will be lost if they close and will simply heap further pressure on the control rooms in the Central Belt.\" In a statement Assistant Chief Constable Val Thomson, commander of Police Scotland's C3 Division which is developing the control room reorganisation, said: \"We remain committed to the C3 change programme and are in discussion with the Scottish Police Authority (SPA).\" A police spokesman said any decision on closures would have to be ratified by the SPA, which oversees the single police force. It said the original timescale was now unlikely to be adhered to. A spokesperson said: \"Consultation with staff has not started yet. The timeline over the coming months needs to allow both proposals from staff via official consultation and any key findings from the HMICS work to be considered, before any final decisions are made.\"",
        "All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination of the fossil remains of a very long-necked, 245 million-year-old marine reptile from China revealed it was carrying an embryo. Jun Liu, first author of the new study in Nature Communications, told BBC News that the animal would have measured between three and four metres long, with a neck that was about 1.7m long. The embryo may have been around half a metre long and is positioned inside the rib cage of the adult Dinocephalosaurus fossil, which was discovered in 2008 in Luoping County, Yunnan Province in southern China. Researchers had to consider whether the smaller animal might have been part of the adult's last meal. But it's facing forward, whereas swallowed prey generally face backwards because predators consume the animal head first to help it go down the throat. Another line of evidence in favour of the live birth idea is that the small reptile inside the mother is clearly an example of the same species. Co-author Prof Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol, told BBC News that the fossil was important because the Archosauromorpha form one of three large groupings of land-based vertebrates (backboned animals), each including about 10,000 species. Since we now know that no fundamental biological barrier to live births exists in this group, palaeontologists would be \"looking very closely\" at other fossils. He suggested one target would be a group of aquatic crocodile relatives - whose mode of reproduction was not well known. Prof Liu, from Hefei University of Technology in China, said the discovery pushes back evidence of reproductive biology in the archosauromorphs by 50 million years. The mode of reproduction in Dinocephalosaurus also points to how the sex of its offspring was determined. Co-author Prof Chris Organ, from Montana State University, added: \"Some reptiles today, such as crocodiles, determine the sex of their offspring by the temperature inside the nest. \"We identified that Dinocephalosaurus, a distant ancestor of crocodiles, determined the sex of its babies genetically, like mammals and birds.\" Prof Benton explained: \"This combination of live birth and genotypic sex determination seems to have been necessary for animals such as Dinocephalosaurus to become aquatic. \"It's great to see such an important step forward in our understanding of the evolution of a major group coming from a chance fossil find in a Chinese field.\" The possibility that an eggshell once surrounded the embryo but was not preserved in fossilisation could not be ruled out, said Prof Benton. But living Archosauromorphs all lay eggs very early in embryonic development, whereas this embryo is very advanced, with well developed bones. Furthermore, the team says Dinocephalosaurus's long neck and other features of its anatomy suggest it could not have manoeuvred easily out of the water, meaning a reproductive strategy like that of turtles - which lay eggs on land before returning to the water - was probably not an option.

        "Carmarthenshire council funded chief executive Mark James in his case over remarks made on Jacqui Thompson's blog. Mr James said in 2012 he would not keep any damages he won. Mrs Thompson, of Llanwrda, must pay Mr James damages of PS25,000 in instalments but Mr James's lawyers would not say if this had been or would be given to the council. As well as the damages, Mrs Thompson must also pay about PS5,000 in interest and nearly PS15,000 in costs for March's enforcement hearing - all the money is due by 2032. BBC Wales understands the legal fees paid by the council on Mr James's behalf were in excess of PS35,000. The authority's pledge to cover these fees was found to be unlawful by the Wales Audit Office. Mr James said in 2012 he was not motivated by money and vowed any damages he won would \"be paid over to the authority.\" When asked if this was still the case, his solicitors, Acuity Legal, said Mr James \"did not intend to give any further statements or any interviews on this subject.\" At a hearing at Carmarthen County Court on 23 March to determine a possession order on Mrs Thompson's house, Mark Spackman, on behalf of Mr James, said this was his intention \"on a voluntary basis\" but was \"irrelevant\" to the hearing.

        "Police officers are allowed to search people for items such as drugs, stolen goods and weapons. But there has been controversy over \"consensual searches,\" where people are searched without any legal basis. If approved by parliament, the code will end consensual searches from May. Ministers asked an advisory group of experts to draft the code following a BBC Scotland investigation which revealed that hundreds of children under the age of 12 were being subjected to consensual stop searches. The new code states that stopping and searching members of the public is a \"significant intrusion into their personal liberty and privacy.\" It must therefore be done for a good reason, and be both \"necessary and proportionate,\" it says. This means that the officer must have a \"reasonable suspicion\" based on \"facts, information andor intelligence\" that the person being searched is likely to be carrying an illegal item. But officers will not be allowed to search someone based purely on their appearance - for example age, race or gender - or because they have previous convictions. The codes states: \"A stop and search will not be carried out in a manner which is abusive, discriminatory, or which amounts to harassment or intimidation.\" The person being searched must understand why it is being carried out, with the officer also required to carry it out \"with respect for individual needs - including religious and cultural values and beliefs.\" And officers must be \"fully accountable\" for the searches they carry out, with all stop and searches accurately recorded, and open to scrutiny. The code also sets out specific guidelines for dealing with children and vulnerable adults, and acknowledges that that they may require additional support to help them comprehend and participate in the search process. It says: \"In taking a decision to search a child or a young person, a constable must treat the need to safeguard and promote the well-being of that child or young person as a primary consideration. \"Where a constable believes it to be more harmful to a child or young person to carry out a search than not, then the search should not proceed and other measures to safeguard them should be considered.\" It also says that officers should use \"age-appropriate terms\" when speaking with children and young people and avoid the use of technical or legal language, unless required to do so by law. The Scottish government announced on 4 November 2016 that there is not enough evidence to support creating a police power to search children for alcohol at this time. The situation will be re-assessed after the code has been in force for 12 months A code of practice underpinning the use of stop and search is required under The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said stop and search was a valuable tool for combating crime, but that it was important to strike a balance between protecting the public and recognising people's human rights. He said: \"This new code is about finding that balance and maintaining the trust between the police and the public. \"With this new code we will ensure stop and search is carried out with the fairness, integrity, respect and accountability that we expect from our police officers in all of their duties.\" Research published by Edinburgh University in 2014 showed police in Scotland were far more likely to carry out stop and searches than their colleagues in England and Wales. The figures also suggested that young people were the most likely to be searched. But the number of stop-and-searches has fallen dramatically since then, with 888 consensual searches and 20,665 statutory searches conducted between 1 April and 30 September last year. This compared with 450,173 consensual searches and 192,470 statutory searches in 201314. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said Police Scotland had made \"real progress\" on the issue, and \"very much welcomed\" the new guidelines. He added: \"We are currently training all our officers in advance of its introduction to ensure we are fully prepared.\"",
        "James Holmes, 24, is accused of opening fire at a midnight showing of the new Batman movie last Friday, killing 12 and wounding 58. Judge William Sylvester has denied a request by Denver-area media for expanded coverage on 30 July. The suspect's lawyers had objected to the media's request. His first court appearance on Monday was filmed, despite the defence team's objections. He appeared dazed as he sat in court in a burgundy jail suit with dyed orange hair, prompting media speculation about his mental state. According to a report on ABC News , the suspect has been forced to wear a face guard because he kept spitting at prison officers. Judge Sylvester's order on Tuesday follows calls from some victims' family members to avoid using the suspect's name and his photos. \"I don't want the media to be saturated with the shooter's name,\" said Jordan Ghawi, whose 24-year-old sister Jessica was killed in the shooting. Police were not allowing residents of Mr Holmes' apartment building to return on Tuesday, as investigators continued to work there. Officials reportedly found 30 grenades and several gallons of gasoline inside the apartment, rigged into a booby-trap. Twenty of the wounded remained in hospital on Tuesday, including six in critical condition. Batman star Christian Bale visited victims at the Medical Center of Aurora in the afternoon, the hospital's president confirmed. \"It was good for the patients,\" Bill Voloch told the Denver Post. \"We hope it was therapeutic for them, and all the staff really appreciated him coming.\" Mr Voloch said that the actor had asked to visit, but requested that the media not be notified. A Facebook photo of Bale at the hospital was posted online. The BBC's Alastair Leithead says the actor also met paramedics, doctors and police officers involved in treating people in the aftermath, as well as visited a makeshift memorial to the dead. Meanwhile, a heavily pregnant 21-year-old woman who escaped the cinema shootings gave birth to a baby boy on Tuesday morning. Katie Medley's husband Caleb, a 23-year-old aspiring comedian, was shot in the head and remains in a critical condition. A small group of Democratic lawmakers in Washington renewed calls on Tuesday to ban high-capacity gun magazines. But with November's elections looming, congressional leaders and President Barack Obama said there would be no movement on gun control in the near future. Senator Robert Menendez, among the few calling for tougher laws, conceded calls for legislation were unlikely to succeed, but said it was important to start a debate. \"I hope that this does spark a national conversation about where we go in terms of reasonable gun control measures,\" Sen Menendez said.

Further questions were raised about his attitude when he held his racquet by the strings when facing match point in a Madrid Open match last year. Tomic's career has also been affected by off-court controversy. In July 2015, he was charged with resisting arrest and trespassing by police in the United States after refusing to leave a hotel room.

Moseley Road Baths is the oldest of only three Grade II-listed swimming pools still in use in the UK. Owned by Birmingham City Council, the building is scheduled for closure in 2016. The Friends of Moseley Road Baths is campaigning for the repair and restoration of the complex so it can continues as an operational swimming pool. An estimated PS42m needs to be spent on Wentworth Woodhouse to address structural damage, plasterwork falling from the ceilings and wet and dry rot taking hold in the historic interiors, said World Monument Watch. The Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust's long-term vision proposes extensive public opening of the house and gardens and residential, business and events uses for various parts of the estate. John Darlington, executive director of World Monuments Fund Britain said: \"Wentworth Woodhouse is an extraordinary building. Its enormous scale is matched by the historic importance of its interiors - representing a roll-call of great British craftsmen - and by the intriguing stories of politics, industry and social change that reverberate within.\" He added: \"Moseley Road Baths is a rare survival: a public building that echoes the class and gender divisions of the early 20th century, but one that is still cherished by local communities today.\" The 2016 World Monument Watch list also includes the Kua Ruins in Tanzania - the remains of a medieval Swahili town at risk from the effects of a harsh climate and looters. Also on the list is Dalieh Raouche in Beruit, a coastal promenade that is the latest victim of a development frenzy that has destroyed many of the city's open spaces. And the near-forgotten remains of World War II concentration camps in Italy are listed as at risk.",

        "GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were \"misguided.\" At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than PS11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, AE attendances and emergency admissions by 1, compared with 201415. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to \"incentivise best quality practice\" and \"drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care.\" \"Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,\" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the \"full impact\" of the incentive scheme and was \"confident that there is no conflict of interest.\" Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a \"financial contaminant\" to patient-doctor trust. He said: \"It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. \"We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms.\" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than PS6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25 with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 201415. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. \"It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,\" he explained. \"The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service.\" Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out PS22bn of efficiency savings by 2020. NHS leaders want to cut patient referrals that are deemed inappropriate, particularly when patients could be cared for locally. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are groups of GPs that work together to plan and design local health services. There are more than 200 CCGs across England and, according to Pulse, at least nine are offering payments for keeping within targets for outpatient referrals and follow ups. It is not clear how extensive the practice is elsewhere. Some have questioned the wisdom of the move, saying patients could miss out on vital care. But CCGs have defended their stance, saying it is about good practice, not about keeping people who need treatment out of hospital. In November the NHS advisory board said GPs in England should nearly double the number of patients referred to hospital for cancer tests. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said delays in spotting symptoms could be costing thousands of lives each year. NHS England said: \"We explicitly want to increase not deter appropriate referrals for cancer checks.\" Dr Rosie Loftus of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings outlined in Pulse as \"very worrying.\" \"This is yet another sign of an NHS which is seriously over stretched and not giving GPs the resources and support they need,\" she said. NHS Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group, which offers payments for practices moving towards the average referral rate, said, like all CCGs, it wanted to reduce the number of patients being sent to hospitals unnecessarily. \"The part of the payment relating to the rate of referrals is a small part of the funding and is not designed to stop GPs referring patients who have a clinical need for hospital treatment such as cancer patients,\" said a spokesperson.",
        "While it limits recruitment from outside the EU, it has \"stimulated recruitment\" from EU countries, the home affairs select committee said. Net migration rose by 30 in the year to June, to 336,000 - more than three times David Cameron's intended target. The PM has said he will not abandon his aim to reduce the figure to 100,000. Under the immigration cap, introduced in 2011, the number of \"tier 2\" visas issued to skilled workers from non-EU countries is limited to 20,700 a year. But a report by the select committee concluded the limit had been \"counter-productive.\" It added that \"a large number\" of applications from nurses with job offers in the UK were being rejected because of limits on the number of visas issued each month. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said the government's immigration cap was having \"no effect\" on bringing down net migration - the difference between those coming into the country and those going out each year - but \"could have caused a crisis in the NHS this winter.\" He said: \"When the cap was reached earlier this year, we saw the perverse effects of the system, as the cap prioritises higher-paid jobs. \"In June, nurses were being prevented from working in the UK, which necessitated the government taking emergency measures to allow recruitment to continue. \"Whilst this was a very welcome move, it is clear to see that the system could have caused a crisis in the NHS this winter. \"A system which encourages panicked adjustments to be functional is not fit for purpose. Nurses should remain on the shortage occupation list.\" A total of 641,000 people moved to the UK in 2014, the Office for National Statistics said.",

        "In February 2016 ministers said funding would stay at PS6.7m in 2016-17, whilst S4C's remit and funding was reviewed. MPs urged ministers to drop plans to cut their contribution to PS6.1m as the review had not yet begun. Culture Minister Matt Hancock said secretary of state Karen Bradley was considering the matter. Most of S4C's PS80m budget comes from the licence fee. The Wales Office does not expect the investigation to be completed until the end of 2017. During a Westminster debate on Wednesday, Mr Hancock said the Department of Culture, Media and Sport's contribution to S4C's budget was currently set to fall to PS6.1m in 2017-18. \"We are aware of commitments given by our predecessor [ex-Culture Secretary John Whittingdale] around timing - and this is an issue the secretary of state [Karen Bradley] is currently considering,\" he said. Ceredigion MP Mark Williams, who called the debate on S4C's future, said: \"It is absolutely right that a review takes place to ensure that it has the funding necessary to fulfil its remit and strategy over the longer term. \"The comprehensive review into S4C announced in February last year, by the former secretary of state, along with a reversal of a cut, prior to the outcome of the review, was welcome. \"But we are now in 2017 and still waiting for a promised review, and there is cross-party concern about the delay.\" Mr Hancock said there would be an announcement about the review \"shortly\" and promised that it would be chaired by someone with \"a thorough understanding of Wales and an interest in the Welsh language.\"",

Johnson County District Judge Thomas Kelly Ryan said: \"Your attempt to bring hate to this community, to bring terror to this community, has failed.\" Miller responded to the sentence, by shouting \"heil Hitler\" before he was removed from the courtroom. He was convicted of one count of capital murder, three counts of attempted murder, and assault and weapons charges. Miller, also known as Frazier Glenn Cross, represented himself during the trial. He admitted to killing William Corporon, 69, and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood, 14, outside the Jewish Community Centre in Overland Park, Kansas. Terri LaManno, 53, was killed outside a Jewish retirement centre. Miller told the jurors he \"knew\" they were going to put him on death row, and he did not care what sentence he would receive. He said he was motivated to kill Jews before he died because he believes they have too much power. Before the shooting, Miller founded several white supremacist groups and later ran twice for elected office on a white power platform.",

        "Media playback is not supported on this device The Sweden striker, who is out of contract after four years at Paris St-Germain, could follow former manager Jose Mourinho to Old Trafford. Football finance expert Rob Wilson says the 34-year-old would be United's most marketable player since Cristiano Ronaldo, and linking up with the three-time European champions would be a \"match made in heaven.\" Wilson says Ibrahimovic's shirt sales alone would help cover the cost of finishing fifth in the Premier League this season and missing out on the riches of playing in Europe's elite competition, worth up to PS50m. \"It would not surprise me if Zlatan sold more shirts than Ronaldo or Lionel Messi,\" Wilson, a lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University, told BBC Sport. \"The cost of missing out on the Champions League is PS30-50m. Zlatan will help plug that gap significantly with the number of shirts shifted by United. \"It is a match made in heaven. The football club is commercially so aware who will exploit every commercial opportunity. \"To them, they are signing a player who understands commercial endorsements and behaves in a way that allows him to maximise them. \"Put that together and you get the holy grail stakes of shirt sales, and stacks of corporate sponsorship. \"Zlatan is also the sort of player who brings ad hoc ticket buyers to a match, even if it is the Europa League or League Cup. \"It is matching the world's biggest sporting brands with one of the most marketable players, who has cult following, plus it is his career swansong. \"If you marry that with Manchester United, he will probably shift more shirts in the next year than any player in the squad because of the superstar status that he has.\" Wilson claimed that Ibrahimovic could become the face of Manchester United. \"Zlatan has a global profile, and global appeal,\" he said. \"Fans will buy shirts with Ibrahimovic on the back in Africa, South East Asia - markets United had a foothold in but not the leverage. \"Only a few select few players can do that: Gareth Bale, Neymar, Lionel Messi and Ronaldo.\" If they are the off-pitch benefits of signing Ibrahimovic, what else will the enigmatic Swede bring to Old Trafford and the Premier League? Since making his debut for his hometown club of Malmo in 1999, Ibrahimovic has played for some of Europe's biggest clubs: Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan and PSG, commanding transfer fees of more than PS120m. He has scored 392 goals in 677 games and last season was his most prolific, with 50 goals in 51 matches - a record for PSG - while his 38 league goals is also a club record. Media playback is not supported on this device Ibrahimovic does not do ordinary goals. He scored four against England in a friendly in 2012, including an amazing overhead kick and then there are the free-kicks, long-range goals, back-heels, flicks and scorpion goals. Manchester United's FA Cup victory on Saturday was their first trophy since the Premier League title in 2013, when Sir Alex Ferguson retired. But Ibrahimovic is used to regular success and has won 12 trophies in four seasons at PSG, including the domestic quadruple twice. While he may not have the same Ballon d'Or collection as Messi or Ronaldo, at least Ibrahimovic can console himself with being - beyond doubt - the best player in Sweden. The striker has won a record 10 Guldbollen (Golden Ball), the award given to the best male footballer in his home country. Ibrahimovic is one of the most quotable figures in world football. Here are just a few examples: Johanna Franden, international football correspondent for Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, has spent four years in Paris reporting on Ibrahimovic. \"He will play up to that image that people had of him,\" Franden told BBC Sport. \"When he says these things there is still a smile behind it, but for the last 15 years he has had so many people telling him how good he is that I think he does believe all of it.\" Ibrahimovic has always enjoyed a spiky relationship with the media and his critics. In 2015, after the semi-final of the French League Cup, he ordered his team-mates not to talk to journalists. When questioned why, he said: \"Because I am the boss.\" \"Only God knows\" was Ibrahimovic's answer when quizzed by a journalist about Sweden's chances against Portugal in the 2014 World Cup play-offs. \"Well, it's a bit hard to ask him,\" the reporter said, to which the player replied: \"You're talking to him now.\" On another occasion, he was forced to apologise for describing France in not so endearing terms. \"There will be a clash [with the media],\" said Franden. \"He will not hold back. He is not scared by the media; he will tell the journalists what he thinks. \"You expect if there is any discontent it will leak out. \"He can handle the pressure, but he keeps his private life private, he does not invite the press in and his partner Helena Seger will be in the limelight more than she has been so far.\" Ibrahimovic could soon be linking up with England captain Wayne Rooney. In a BBC documentary, he said of Rooney: \"I'd prefer to have him in my team than play against him. I've not been lucky enough to play with him but I enjoy seeing him on the pitch. If I cannot play with him, I will watch him.\" But it is fair to say Ibrahimovic has not always enjoyed the best relationship with team-mates and it is safer to stay on his good side. He once put AC Milan team-mate Gennaro Gattuso in a bin after a training session, in retaliation for being teased by the Italian. A fight with AC Milan team-mate and 6ft 5in American Oguchi Onyewu ended with a broken rib for Ibrahimovic, he once threatened to break Ajax team-mate Rafael van der Vaart's legs and another time he hit Mido after the Egyptian threw a pair of scissors at him. Earlier this year, Ibrahimovic told his PSG team-mates at half-time to \"play as I tell you and everything will be fine.\" \"It is a good time for him to go to United, as there is not such a clear leader in the squad,\" said Franden. \"If he goes to United it is because Mourinho has told him he will be the number one, the most important voice in the locker room. \"Zlatan wants to be the most important player on the pitch. He is not a leader in the way he talks, but he expects team-mates to listen to him especially when he is not happy. He is also extremely demanding of himself. \"He will be a good example to the young players in how disciplined he is and how hard he works. He is always early for training and one of the last to leave. He eats healthy and does not drink or smoke.\" Former United assistant manager Rene Meulensteen told BBC Radio 5 live: \"In some ways Ibrahimovic is the perfect fit for Manchester United at this moment in time. They have young players in the dressing room and he is a leader, a winner. \"He would bring a lot to the club and really put United back to winning ways\" Ibrahimovic is joining United to link back up with Mourinho, who coached him at Inter Milan for a season from 2008-09. \"From being a cat, I felt like a lion,\" was how Ibrahimovic described the impact of Mourinho in an interview with Radio 5 live. \"He was amazing. He dragged out of me things that no other coach has done before. When I played I felt like a Terminator, I felt so confident under him.\" In his book I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic, he described Mourinho as a manager he was \"willing to die for.\" \"The first time he met my partner Helena, he whispered to her:'Helena, you have only one mission: feed Zlatan, let him sleep, keep him happy'.\" \"Mourinho knows what he is bringing. Zlatan has always wanted to work with him again,\" said Franden. \"He had been very eager and was disappointed Mourinho had not got him in before. \"He said at Inter that Mourinho was the best he had worked with and was disappointed Mourinho has, until now, not picked up the phone to ask him to come. Mourinho has always praised Zlatan. \"When Zlatan left Inter some players said they were two seconds away from getting physical with each other. There was not enough air to breathe but Zlatan is willing to work with him. They are two big egos and they do clash.\" \"If Mourinho lights up a room, Guardiola draws the curtains,\" wrote Ibahimovic about former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, who takes over at Manchester City next season. He referred to the Spaniard as a \"spineless coward\" in his autobiography, and Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed Ibrahimovic said he \"might punch Pep\" during his time at Barcelona. Barcelona bought Ibrahimovic for PS57m and he scored 21 goals in 51 matches, but he felt he was used incorrectly by Guardiola and once confronted him on the training ground over lack of playing time. \"I said I was being used in the wrong way and that they shouldn't have bought me if they wanted another type of player,\" he wrote about a meeting with Guardiola. \"I told him what a friend had said to me:'You bought a Ferrari but drive it like a Fiat. Expect fireworks at the Manchester derby next season. Former team-mate Peter Schmeichel said Ibrahimovic could have the same affect at Old Trafford as Eric Cantona, the iconic French striker. \"United need inspirational players, players that stand alone,\" said the former Denmark keeper. \"We had Cantona in the mid-90s. A lot of what happened in the 1990s would not have happened without him. Now it is time to have someone like that again. Zlatan fits that bill. \"In the last five years Zlatan has only improved his fitness, his abilities and output. His stats are unbelievable. Not just say in the French league, because he does it in Europe and for Sweden. He finds the goals, he finds the tricks, he finds what the crowd needs. I said this before, he was born to play for United.\" Ex-United midfielder Paul Scholes added: \"Zlatan joining United does excite me. I know it might only be one or two years at the most, but he is a fit lad, looks after himself and is a great character, he could pull it off without a shadow of a doubt.\" Brazil left-back Maxwell and Ibrahimovic first met at Ajax in 2001 and have followed each other to Inter Milan, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain. They are close friends. The pair have won 10 league titles together, so could we see Maxwell join his friend across the English Channel?

        "Thunderstorms are short, sharp and shocking - for some literally. If you can hear the clouds rumbling, chances are the storm is close enough for you to be hit by lightning - it can strike up to 10 miles away from the centre of a storm. Count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder - if it is less than 30 seconds, there is a threat. If thunderstorms are forecast, postpone or cancel outdoor activities - especially golf and rod fishing. If a storm is approaching, take cover inside or in a car with the windows wound up - sheds, isolated trees and convertibles do not afford sufficient protection. Boaters and swimmers should get to shore as quickly as possible, as water conducts electricity. So too do metal pipes and phone lines. Unplug all non-essential appliances, including the television, as lightning can cause power surges. Do not use candles if the lights go out, as this poses a fire risk, and instead use a torch. Do not make phone calls, unless it is in an emergency, or put up an umbrella - the metal directs the current into the body. It is also best to put off baths, showers and dish washing, in case lightning strikes the house and sends a jolt of electricity through the metal plumbing. If caught outside in a thunderstorm, find a low spot away from trees, fences, and poles. If your skin tingles and hair stands on end, lightning is about to strike. Crouch down immediately, balancing on the balls of your feet, placing hands on knees with head between them. This makes you into the smallest target possible, and minimises contact with the ground. If someone has been hit by lightning, call for help as they will need urgent medical attention. It is safe to touch them - people struck by lightning carry no electrical charge that can shock other people. Check for a pulse and for breathing - if you know first aid, begin artificial respiration and CPR if necessary. If they are breathing, check for other possible injuries. Lightning strike victims have burns in two places - where the electric shock entered and then left the body, usually the soles of the feet. They may have broken bones or loss of hearing or sight. If waters start to rise, head for higher ground. Do not try to drive to safety, as cars can float in as little as a couple of feet of water, the depth of which is often very difficult to judge. Be wary of venturing out too soon - the BBC Weather Centre advises waiting 30 minutes after the last flash of lightning. Avoid downed power lines or broken cables. And one final tip - it is a myth that lightning never strikes the same place twice and always hits the tallest object. Lightning strikes the best conductor on the ground - whether it has been struck before or not. Sources: The Met Office and BBC Weather",
        "The Mosque and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB) recognises the problem of abuse in the after school classes. Ahmed Beg, from the board, said: \"We are working to raise standards and want the teachers to be qualified.\" Irfan Patel, 33, was found guilty on Friday of cruelty against children at a Lancashire mosque. A Lancashire mother, who wanted to remain anonymous, was horrified to discover her son's madrassa teacher had been hitting and abusing him. \"I never sent him to be beaten - I sent him to learn the Koran,\" she said. He was not the only one to suffer at the hands of a teacher at a madrassa, an after school class where children learn about their faith. In the last year, three teachers from madrassas in Lancashire have been convicted of beating children, the latest case involving Patel. In August Kurram Hussain, also from Blackburn, was found guilty of what magistrates called \"gratuitous degradation\" in beating two boys aged 10 and 11. That followed Ibrahim Yusuf's conviction while teaching at an Accrington madrassa in 2011. The mother said police had told her that her son's teacher had punched him in the stomach and \"slapped his face, and hit his hands with a pencil.\" \"And he made him stand like a chicken. If he fell down, after five minutes my boy said he made him do another five minutes.\" The stress position her son was forced to adopt is a torture tactic used in war zones. Corporal punishment has been banned in mainstream schools since the 1980s. However, madrassas are classed as supplementary schools where it is still legal in religious settings as long as it does not exceed \"reasonable chastisement.\" The schools are unregulated and teachers often have no training. Nazir Afzal, the chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, handled all three prosecutions. He thinks abuse is far more widespread. \"When we talk about three successful prosecutions in the last year in the North West and probably a dozen nationally, we're talking about literally the tip of the iceberg,\" he said. \"In order to meet the demand, schools are being set up left right and centre. \"There is no Ofsted, no inspection regime, they're reliant entirely on a particular committee enforcing standards, ensuring discipline is correctly maintained. \"And if they are not up to the job, there's nothing to prevent children being harmed pretty much on a daily basis.\" One school leading the way in the reform is Jamia Ghosia Academy in Blackburn. It has become more like mainstream schools and is seen as a model of good practice by teachers at madrasssas in other parts of the country. Classes are small and interactive, staff are checked for criminal records, CCTV is in place to protect pupils and corporal punishment is banned. Head teacher Ustad Muhammad said: \"In terms of corporal punishment, I'm not going to accept that in any form or any way because no child learns with that. \"You have to be patient. Children can be rowdy, can shout, can do certain things but that's the whole idea of having teacher training and learning certain types of skills.\"",

        "The Friends of Sherwood Forest say the PS5.3m centre, located on the edge of a country park, will devastate the area. \"It has all sorts of wildlife - insect life and newts,\" the charity's group spokesman Adrian Wilson said.

The current centre is in Sherwood Forest Country Park, on land designated as a site of special scientific interest but plans are to move it to Forest Corner, on grassland on the edge of the park.

The striker added a second two minutes later and substitute Joe Dodoo made it 3-0 in 83 minutes. McInnes admits he was taken aback by the sudden turnaround and was disappointed by the manner in which his troops responded. \"I think we had real control of the game,\" he added. \"I thought we were better team, certainly in the second half. We started both halves really well but we allowed the first half to get a bit untidy and we didn't pass the ball the way we normally do at home. \"We started the second half strongly and the game was played in their defensive third. Their keeper made a couple of very good saves, particularly from (Adam) Rooney - I thought it was past him to be honest. \"When I was contemplating changes at 0-0 I didn't feel a threat and I thought the goal was coming but unfortunately for us we played a part in our own downfall by giving away a poor goal and we had a crazy five minutes after that. \"Our reaction to losing the first goal was what I'm most disappointed with. From being in charge of the game and looking the most likely we've allowed Kenny Miller the opportunity to show his quality, and he showed it. \"Mentally we've got to be better than that. We normally respond well to going behind - it doesn't happen too often but we have to react better than that and if there's one lesson from today, it is that. \"It's a sore one for us, no doubt about it. In the eyes of our supporters that's a huge disappointment today and we understand that. \"We lost the fight today but it's important we still win the battle for second place, and hopefully get ourselves into a cup final \"We've been on a very good run but that doesn't give you any guarantees, and it's a reminder that there is still work to be done. When you lose a game like today and the huge feeling of disappointment, wishing we could play it all over again, we've got to channel that the right way. We have plenty to look forward to.\"",
        "Kensington and Chelsea Council won an earlier case against Sophie Sotello in the magistrates' court after she refused to comply with the order. When she appealed against the decision, the council dropped its case. It said that it was now satisfied with evidence showing that her son, 11-year-old Gabriel Sotello, was receiving a suitable education. Gabriel Sotello is one of more than 21,000 children on local council records as being home schooled. According to the home education group Ed Yourself numbers have grown rapidly - by 17 between July 2013 and July 2014. Many of these pupils, like Gabriel, have never been to school. Others have been taken out because their parents felt they were being bullied, neglected or were not reaching their potential. Home schooled children do not have to follow the national curriculum or take part in public exams such as GCSEs or A-levels. Mrs Sotello says her role is not to teach Gabriel, but to point him in the right direction. \"I wouldn't dream of saying I teach him,\" she says. \"I facilitate, I find the books, I research with them, I give them the power if you like. It is child centred, finding out what makes them tick.\" Gabriel initiates much of his own learning and says he is inspired by the freedom to focus on what most interests him. \"Freedom is what makes learning still fun,\" he says. \"In home education you can learn at your own pace and you do learn much quicker.\" Parents give various reasons for shunning school, and taking direct responsibility for educating their children. Jackie Fahy, who organises a weekly meeting in a London park for like-minded parents, says some doubt the worth of the regimented school curriculum. \"A lot of children come out of school not prepared. The workplace is changing so rapidly that actually the school system is huge and vast and slow to change. I'm not sure that children will be prepared for having several careers in a lifetime.\" Elizabeth Lil - who opted to educate her son and daughter herself - says that as a former teacher she felt that barely a tenth of her time in school was actually benefiting children. \"I was a science teacher, I did maths. I've so far used trigonometry once in my adult life. What you learn at school is not necessarily the skills you need for your adult life.\" These parents complain that councils are exceeding their powers by carrying out routine inspections of the quality of their children's education. They insist that councils should intervene only if they have evidence that something is wrong. But grey areas persist over exactly what councils can or should do. Government guidance is clear that local authorities have no statutory duty to investigate the education children are receiving at home on a routine basis. It says that parents are not legally obliged to cooperate with requests from councils for information. The guidance tells councils not to confuse home education with truancy. But it acknowledges that if councils are concerned then they might impose the sort of school attendance order sent to the Sotellos. In a statement, Kensington and Chelsea Council acknowledged the right of parents to educate their children at home. But it said \"when this happens we believe that we have a duty of care to establish that the child is receiving a suitable education.\"",
        "He was seriously injured in a bomb attack in Afghanistan in 2006. Since carrying the torch on 26 June, Doncaster-based LBdr Parkinson has had thousands of requests on Facebook. But the site limits friend associations to 5,000 per personal page and he cannot accept all the requests. Flanked by hundreds of people, he walked for nearly half an hour with the Olympic torch with an assistant who supported his arm. LBdr Parkinson's nomination stated: \"The brain injury took his speech, but not his personality and sense of humour,\" adding he now speaks unaided. It said: \"Determined to prove everyone wrong, he fought back every step of the way. Ben's intelligence and wit [are] unchanged. Still the same funny and caring Ben.\" He spends 12 hours a day in the gym and rehab and walks with crutches, spending \"the rest of his time spent raising money for many military charities and as patron of his beloved Pilgrim Bandits .\" LBdr Parkinson's mother Diane said the responses had \"been phenomenal\" and that Ben was really \"buoyed up\" by the support and friendship he had been shown. She said: \"It's just unbelievable, Ben's had way over 5,000 friend requests but Facebook won't let him have more than that number. \"Thousands of people have joined the Pilgrim Bandits website and the messages of support we've had are great. \"Ben's page has had 19,000 hits just on an update, I don't understand how these things work, but it's phenomenal.\" She said the amount of post the family had received had also increased. She added: \"Some mail has just been addressed to Ben, please Mr Postie. \"E-mail traffic has gone through the roof and Ben's had hundreds of requests to visit places with the [Olympic] torch. \"He's absolutely bouncing and buoyed up and elated.\" Facebook would not comment on the issue but their guidance was that if people were receiving this many requests then they have become a public figure, so should consider having a page instead of a profile. Alternatively, Ben could use subscribe so that people can see his public updates without actually becoming a friend. A total of 8,000 people will carry the flame during its 8,000 mile, 70-day journey to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London on 27 July.",
        "The Phab2Pro's sensors allow it to make sense of objects and close-by spaces, allowing graphics to be intelligently added to real-world views. The Moto Z uses magnets to add optional hardware modules to the phone's rear including a speaker and a projector. Analysts said the innovations might prove a tough sell. That would complicate Lenovo's efforts to turn around sales of its own phones and those of the Motorola division it bought from Google for 2.8bn in 2014. \"There's a delicate balance between being on the leading edge and the bleeding edge, and Lenovo skirts that line,\" said Ramon Llamas from the tech research firm IDC. \"If these products prove to be a hit - and that's a big if - then Lenovo emerges as a leading edge vendor. \"The Phab2Pro has a lot of promise, showing immediate value creation within certain use cases. The Moto Z is certainly innovative, but I'm not sure how much consumers can wrap their brains around modular devices.\" The announcements were made at an event in San Francisco, where bendy smartphone and tablet prototypes were also revealed. Lenovo is currently the world's sixth bestselling smartphone-maker, according to IDC, after being overtaken by two other Chinese brands, Oppo and Vivo towards the start of the year. The Beijing-based company reported in May that it had swung to a loss of 128m (PS89m) in its last financial year. It acknowledged at the time that it was having problems integrating Motorola. The Phab2Pro is the first device to use Google's Tango technology. The search firm has developed a system that adds depth-sensing and motion-tracking cameras to the normal front and rear photo lenses. Lenovo suggested this opened up several possibilities, including: However, an on-stage demo proved problematic. A game of virtual dominos - seen superimposed over a view of a real desk - saw the pieces repeatedly freeze part way through their intended run. And an effort to use the sensors to get the dimensions of a real-world table took several attempts to get the software to lock onto the object. This raises questions about whether the tech is ready to go on sale as planned in September. \"In real life you're just going to use a tape measure\" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy. \"It's just a classic example of a solution looking for a problem. \"Yes, you can envisage some lovely use cases - for example a DHL app that would let you hold up a parcel and give you its dimensions and the approximate cost to send it. \"But that doesn't exist yet, and what you end up with is an underwhelming measuring demo.\" The Moto Z introduces the concept of Moto Mods - snap-on parts that connect to the back of the phone via 16 small metal pins. Examples of modules it plans to offer alongside the phone include: Lenovo said it was working with others to create new modules and also urged developers to create more following the phone's release later this summer. LG already has an alternative modular handset on sale - the G5 - and Google is working on Project Ara, a design that will allow several parts to be added at once. They mark a break with a trend that has seen phone manufacturers integrate components as closely together as possible to maximise battery life and computing power. One industry watcher questioned the appeal. \"Consumers just do not want another item to carry with them,\" said Carolina Milanesi from the market research firm Creative Strategies. \"When we do chose to carry something separate, it serves a very specific purpose or it is made by a brand that we want to carry because it is the best in that segment. \"While Lenovo talked about wanting to limit compromise it seems to me that you are still left with one.\" Lenovo also showed off several concept devices at its presentation. These included a smartphone and tablet with flexible screens. This allowed the handset to be wrapped around a person's wrist so that it did not have to be held, and a tablet to be folded in half, making it easier to use one-handed. In addition, the firm briefly showed off a revised model of its smart shoes. It said the Intel processor-equipped footwear could track its wearer's movements and calorie burn. The firm did not, however, say when any of these might go on sale. Motorola's Razr - the thin flip phone from 2003 - was an iconic piece of design, something the company has been trying to replicate ever since. Today, Motorola - now part of Lenovo after a brief stint being owned by Google - thinks Moto Mods might be its next design masterstroke. I don't. The firm has been working on a modular phone for some time, and the idea of swapping components is appealing - strapping on a projector when you need it, or souped-up speakers, could be very useful. But there are already battery packs out there. And Bluetooth accessories that will give you much the same functionality. They may not be as easy to \"snap,\" but I can't see it being enough to tempt people into ditching what they already have. In the same vein, the Phab2Pro, the smartphone with Tango built in, offers some promising new applications worth thinking about, particularly for retail. But the question isn't whether Tango is cool. It clearly is. The question is whether Tango is the sort of feature that would alter your smartphone buying choices. And that's where the technology falls well short. It's a luxury, not a necessity, and when up against its cheaper rivals, a Lenovo phone with Tango won't ever be more appealing to the masses than a cheaper smartphone from Xiaomi or ZTE. That's why Lenovo has dropped out of the top five smartphone makers in the world.",
        "The cygnets and their mother had recently become a familiar sight around Lisnarick, outside Irvinestown. Pat Masterson, who lives in Lisnarick, photographed the swans shortly before they were killed on Tuesday evening. \"When I saw their mother walking them along the road, all in line, I stopped to take a picture,\" said Ms Masterson. \"They've visited our farm every day over the last few weeks so I've photographed them before, but I thought that the way the wee cygnets were following their mother was just so lovely I had to stop and watch. \"I still can't believe that they were run over so soon after.\" Enniskillen-based vet Kevin Leonard, who happened to be passing moments after the birds were killed, said he was shocked by what he saw. \"The five of them were just lying in a row behind the mother, who was injured as well. \"Four of them were dead and the fifth was so badly mangled I had to put it down with an injection. \"The sixth one only had minor injuries, so I gave it an anti-biotic cream and guided it into a nearby field alongside its mother. \"It was actually quite an upsetting sight. I can't believe whoever killed them just drove on.\" Paul Hoy, who had also stopped when he saw the dead swans, assisted the vet in moving them to safety. He said he was \"disgusted\" by what he saw. \"A girl who was there said she saw the car running them down and driving on. \"We're all wondering how this could have been an accident - it's a 30mph speed limit there and it wasn't dark so the swans were very visible. \"If you can't see six swans on the road, what are the chances you'll see a child? As native wild birds, swans enjoy statutory protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and it is an offence to intentionally injure, take or kill a wild swan. The act similarly protects the eggs and nests of swans. It is an offence to take or possess the egg of a wild mute swan, or to damage or destroy the nest of a mute swan whilst in use or being built. The RSPB said anyone who witnesses an offence against swans or other wildlife should contact their police Wildlife Liaison Officer through their local police station.",
        "The end-of-season event gets under way on Sunday, with more than 250,000 spectators expected across eight days. Security is under review but the same measures are in place as last year, when the venue was on high alert. Jamie Murray opens play at the O2 Arena alongside doubles partner John Peers at 12:00 GMT on Sunday. \"It's obviously a terrible thing that's happened,\" said Murray. \"It's affected so many people and I guess there are a lot of shockwaves around the world that something like that can happen.\" At least 128 people were killed in attacks carried out by eight gunmen and suicide bombers in the French capital. Mahut, 33, and Herbert, 24, are making their debuts at the season finale for the best eight teams in the world. They will play Croatia's Ivan Dodig and Brazilian Marcelo Melo in their opening match at 18:00 on Monday, and hope to reflect events in their home country. \"We are discussing with the ATP to do something, at least to wear something on the shirt,\" said Mahut, who lives in Paris. \"We didn't talk with the other players but I'm sure they will do something. That is the only thing we can do and have a thought for the families, and let the politicians do what they have to do.\" The ATP confirmed \"enhanced security\" is in place and preparations continue as normal, reminding spectators that bag searches will be in place and no food or drink can be taken into the O2 Arena. The French pair watched events unfold on television in London and Herbert said they were \"still in shock\" on Saturday. \"Right now are thoughts are with the victims, the families and the guys fighting to get peace and Paris secure again,\" he said. Having confirmed that his friends and family - who live in Strasbourg - were safe, he added: \"I'm one of the lucky people, but it doesn't matter because I feel really, really touched by what is happening right now in France. \"When it happens in your country I think the feeling is even worse. I mean, I'm scared right now. \"Yesterday we were quite happy, it's the first time for us here working in a kind of euphoria, and then you get a message, a call, and from one second to the other you're scared, you feel bad about what happened in France. \"Right now it's tough to realise because I think we're still in shock and afraid of what's happening.\" While the pair still plan to play in London, Mahut said \"tennis comes second now\" after confirming his friends and family were also safe. He said: \"Of course we were scared but I think that's what they want. \"It's not easy to talk about what happened right now. I just talked to the family and friends - I had some friends who were having dinner in the Bataclan area last night. \"At this moment we should be having fun playing the World Tour finals but today it's really complicated for us.\" The World Tour Finals is the season finale for both singles and doubles, with world number one Novak Djokovic taking on Japan's Kei Nishikori at 14:00 GMT on Sunday, followed by Roger Federer against Tomas Berdych at 20:00.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device Mal Meninga's team went through the tournament unbeaten - and in wrestling the title from the Kiwis reclaimed the world number one ranking. With a quarter of the match gone, tries from Blake Ferguson, Josh Dugan and Trent Merrin plus a penalty from Johnathan Thurston gave the Kangaroos an unassailable 20-0 lead. That was 24-0 by the break as the ruthless Australians added to their score when Dugan touched down a kick from Thurston. Full-back Darius Boyd extinguished any hope of an unlikely comeback with a score shortly after the restart and although two tries from Jordan Kahu reduced the deficit, Australia's Boyd Cordner had the final word with a late score. Australia coach Meninga is a Liverpool FC fan and must have been delighted with the ruthless performance from his team at Anfield. Meninga had targeted reclaiming the world number one ranking during this tour and that never looked in doubt on a chilly Sunday afternoon when their opponents were simply unable to answer the questions asked of them. The defending champions briefly rallied after Ferguson had touched down in the corner two minutes in and again for a period in the second half, but by and large Australia were utterly dominant. Brilliantly marshalled by halves Thurston and Cooper Cronk and hooker Cameron Smith, they built pressure, dominated field position and looked a class above the only team to have come anywhere near them in this tournament, their group game at Coventry ending 14-8. They targeted the defence of makeshift Kiwi half-back Tohu Harris, kicked penalties to extend their lead even when the game was surely already theirs and for most of the match showed a hunger and desire way beyond what the Kiwis possessed. One year before the World Cup, it is difficult to see on the form they have shown in England how any other team can prevent them from retaining their title. This competition was David Kidwell's first as coach of New Zealand - and aside from claiming his first win in their 17-16 victory over England, little has gone right for him or his team. They were held to a draw by Scotland at Workington last week and at Anfield looked some way short of producing the sort of mercurial, against-the-odds performance that saw them win the Four Nations in 2014. New Zealand have now lost four times to Australia in 2016 - once in Stephen Kearney's last game in charge and three times under Kidwell. There has been some speculation in the Kiwi press that Kidwell would benefit from a coaching mentor and right now there is plenty for him to think about. Shaun Johnson showed glimpses of the brilliance he possesses during the tournament but plus points were at a premium. New Zealand's poor record in England continues - they lost a Test series against England in 2015 and have not won a Tri-Nations or Four Nations over here - and they will need to vastly improve if they want to threaten at the World Cup. Australia: D. Boyd, Ferguson, Inglis, Dugan, Holmes, Thurston, Cronk, Scott, Smith, Woods, Cordner, Gillett, Merrin. Replacements: Morgan, Klemmer, Frizell, S. Boyd. New Zealand: Kahu, Fusitu'a, Kata, Kenny-Dowall, Rapana, Harris, Johnson, J. Bromwich, Luke, Blair, Proctor, Ma'u, Taumalolo. Replacements: Brown, Taupau, Eastwood, Tapine.

        "The huts, made of chalk and straw daub and wheat-thatched roofing, have been based on archaeological remains found at Durrington Walls, near Stonehenge. Project leader Luke Winter said: \"What we're trying to do is get a sense of what these buildings looked like above-ground.\" The hope is to re-build the huts at Stonehenge visitor centre next year. \"What makes the buildings interesting is that they were dated to about the same time as the large sarsen stones were being erected at Stonehenge,\" Mr Winter said. \"One of the theories is that these may have housed the people that were helping with construction of that monument.\" Inside, the project team has used a variety of different daubs, made of pig soil [dung] or chalk and straw and construction techniques that would have been used by Neolithic people. \"We've been trying a completely different way of thatching a roof. Nothing is tied onto the roof, as you would in a modern thatched building but the wheat straw that we've used is knotted and then tucked into a woven framework. \"Often people think 4,500 years ago is a long time ago, which of course to us as modern people it is, but it's well into beginnings of agriculture. \"We're looking at people that were farming, keeping cows and domesticating cereal crops, and of course houses were an important thing.\" The Neolithic huts will be kept for another two months and will open to the public during the two May bank holidays.",
        "Lego refused a bulk order for bricks that were to be used in a new artwork about political dissidents as part of an exhibition in Melbourne, Australia. Toymaker Lego said it never sold directly to anyone wanting to use its product to make a political statement. The artist has since been deluged with offers of Lego from supporters. Ai used Lego last year to create portraits of 175 dissident figures who had been jailed or exiled, from Nelson Mandela to Edward Snowden, on the site of the former Alcatraz prison near San Francisco. He planned a similar work for the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, but a bulk order placed by the museum was rejected by the Danish company. The Chinese artist said the company told the museum its bricks could not be used for artworks containing \"any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements.\" Referring to The Lego Movie's slogan \"everything is awesome,\" Ai wrote on Twitter: \"Lego will tell us what to do, or not to do. That is awesome!\" He added: \"Lego is giving us the definition of what is'political', and all the big corporations are telling us what to love or hate. That is awesome.\" In an Instagram post, he wrote: \"As a commercial entity, Lego produces and sells toys, movies and amusement parks attracting children across the globe. \"As a powerful corporation, Lego is an influential cultural and political actor in the globalized economy with questionable values. \"Lego's refusal to sell its product to the artist is an act of censorship and discrimination.\" Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbaek would not comment directly on the case but said that, as a principle, Lego \"respects any individual's right to free, creative expression.\" But he added that the company had a long-standing policy not to directly sell to anyone if it knew that its bricks would be used to make a political statement. The artist also linked Lego's stance with plans for a new Legoland in Shanghai. Lego said the theme park was being built by Merlin Entertainment and not Lego, but that Lego does have some ties with Merlin because it uses the Lego brand. Ai Weiwei is known for his criticism of the Chinese government as well as for being one of the world's leading contemporary artists. He was arrested during a crackdown on political activists in China in 2011 and was released without charge after 81 days. The Chinese authorities kept his passport for four years, but it was returned earlier this year.",
        "Roger Hamer, died from head injuries, a month after the accident on Bury New Road, Ramsbottom, in March 2016. The Rochdale Coroner's Court jury's narrative verdict found \"inconsistencies\" in the way Bury Council dealt with some road repairs. Lessons had been learned and the road would be resurfaced, the council said. Catherine James, of solicitors Irwin Mitchell, said legal action had started by Mr Hamer's family against the council. Mr Hamer's daughter Ruth Topping said: \"I hope the authorities will learn lessons as I do not want my father to have died in vain. \"I do not want any other family to suffer like we have suffered or like my father suffered - he had an horrific death.\" The jury found that hitting a pothole had probably contributed to Mr Hamer, from Ramsbottom, coming off his bike on a road which had several defects. Its narrative verdict said Bury Council had \"followed repair guidelines\" but found there had been inconsistencies in the way it dealt with some repairs. The authority said it had learned lessons and was improving its training. It added that Bury New Road would be fully resurfaced by next March. The coroner is writing to both the Department of Transport and Bury Council highlighting a number of concerns raised during the inquest.",
        "Ricciardo and Vettel are respectively 60 and 117 points behind leader Lewis Hamilton with 150 still available. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said their title hopes were a \"long shot\" but Mercedes' reliability problems gave them a chance. \"Due to their shocking reliability, hopefully we can keep ourselves in the championship,\" he said. Although reigning champion Vettel is almost completely out of the reckoning and has only a mathematical chance, Horner says it is too early for Red Bull to consider team orders to aid Ricciardo's challenge. Vettel finished second to Hamilton in Singapore on Sunday with Ricciardo third while Nico Rosberg retired with an electrical failure. \"Mercedes have an enormous advantage at this point,\" Horner said. \"We'll take it one race at a time. Both of them are still just in it and both have taken a chunk of points out of Nico. \"Daniel, OK he's conceded three points to Seb but is that going to make the difference? Impossible to say with a crystal ball at this stage but at the moment it doesn't make sense to interfere with team orders. \"Daniel is totally comfortable and happy with that. \"If there was a realistic chance of Daniel winning and Sebastian was mathematically out of the championship, then we'd do the best we can for the team but the situation we're in at the moment is it's a long shot.\"",
        "Reports on Tuesday suggested the 28-year-old's representatives are set for talks with the English side. \"There are no direct offers,\" the source told BBC Sport. \"Only by meeting the release clause of 94,376,000 euros will the player leave Napoli. Otherwise Higuain will stay for the remaining two years of his deal.\" Gareth Bale's PS85m move from Tottenham to Real Madrid in 2013 is the most expensive transfer in football history, surpassing the PS80m Real paid Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009. In 2013, then Real Madrid forward Higuain agreed personal terms with Arsenal, but joined Napoli after the Gunners failed to make an offer. Last season, Higuain won the Capocannoniere - Serie A's golden boot - after scoring a league record 36 goals as Napoli finished runners-up to Juventus.

        "He would go on to become an iconic figure in Cornish rugby, paving the way for other Pacific islanders to play rugby in the UK, and this week a capacity crowd of 3,000 turned out in his honour. A charity rugby match to raise money for the Marie Therese hospital in Hayle, which has become the former player's home since he was left paralysed in an operation last year, was organised by his sons and featured a fly-past by a helicopter from RNAS Culdrose. All three of Mr Matavesi's sons play rugby professionally and they called upon some of their illustrious colleagues to take part while others, like England international Jack Nowell, donated signed shirts that helped raise nearly PS8,000 in an auction. Ex-All Blacks player Jerry Collins, who died in a car crash earlier this month, had been due to play. The event was the latest in a story that started with less fanfare when Matavesi senior came to the UK on a rugby tour with the Fiji Barbarians, in 1985. He made such an impression during a match in Cornwall that Camborne rugby club paid for him to return to play for them. As rugby union was an amateur sport in the 1980s, the club had to find him a job and the former coconut farmer, from the remote Vanua Balavu island in eastern Fiji, was taken on as a miner at South Crofty. \"The only job available was tin mining, there was a lot of banter down there and I loved it,\" Mr Matavesi said. \"All the rugby players worked down at the mine and everybody looked after each other, apart from at the weekend when we would play against each other and try to kill each other, that was the Cornish way of life. \"Rugby was completely different in Fiji, I couldn't even afford a pair of boots. I had to borrow my dad's which were size 14 and pack them with pieces of cloth and paper.\" He returned to play for the club for several seasons before making Cornwall his permanent home after meeting Camborne local Karen Lean, with whom he started a family after they married. When she died in 2005, Mr Matavesi was left to bring up eldest son Josh, 24, who plays for Swansea's Ospreys and features in the Fijian World Cup squad. His middle son Sam, aged 23, whose regular job is with Plymouth Albion, has also represented Fiji and his youngest son 20-year-old Joel, is up and coming at Ospreys, too. \"It's so weird watching the boys on TV. I'm in the hospital with an iPad, that they had to teach me how to use - it's not like smoke signals in Fiji,\" Mr Matavesi quipped. \"That was one proud moment for me, when I saw Josh run out and sing the national anthem, I didn't know if he could speak Fijian or not but I saw his lips moving!\" The 59-year-old describes his Marie Therese home as \"one of the best places that ever existed,\" but was moved to organise the charity match when he realised its facilities were lacking. \"I suddenly found my strength here, it's the way the staff treat us, we're not treated as a number,\" he said. \"The nurses are doing a lot of physical lifting as there are three lifts and two of them don't work. \"The gym is empty, whatever we can screw, velcro or tie together, we'll use. I'm lucky enough to see this and be looked after by these dedicated staff.\" He approaches his life there with the same spirit Roger Moyle recognised in the 1980s. Mr Moyle was one of the men who was instrumental in bringing him to Cornwall in the first place, a decision he describes as \"one of the greatest things we ever did.\" \"He had a massive frame and he entered the clubhouse like a true south sea island warrior, he turned out to be an iconic player for us, loved wherever we went,\" he said. Mr Matavesi joked that it did not take long for his massive frame to be enhanced by the local delicacy. \"When I came over I was about 15-16 stone and I was playing as a loose forward,\" he said. \"Then, after so many pasties, I had to be pushed in front to prop - I was beginning to look like a pasty.\"",

        "The PM was chomping on the PS1.80 snack on an Easyjet flight to Portugal - sparking incredulity on social media. Fellow passenger Ashleigh was amazed too, telling her Twitter followers: \"Guys I'm crying he was eating Pringles.\" \"I found the experience humbling,\" she told BBC News. The eagle-eyed teenager also managed to grab a selfie with the apparently oblivious Mr Cameron to liven up the holiday flight she was taking with her boyfriend. The prime minister, who was sitting with his bodyguards, can be seen playing with - or possibly working on - his iPad in an economy seat. He is believed to have been flying out to Portugal to join wife Samantha and their three children on holiday. Twitter users were quick to flag up other examples of snack-related Cameron trivia - such as a curious picture of him eating a hot dog with a knife and fork during the election campaign. Others wondered why the prime minister was using a budget airline, suggesting he was trying to burnish his \"man of the people\" credentials. Britain's political leaders have been wary of being pictured eating since then Labour leader Ed Miliband was snapped by a press photographer having difficulties with a bacon sandwich.

        "After a sterile first 60 minutes, Stephane Sessegnon fired the Baggies into the lead with a powerful shot. Stoke created little in the second half but substitute Jonathan Walters headed them level from a superb Joselu cross. Almost immediately, the visitors' Geoff Cameron was sent off for striking Claudio Yacob before Evans tapped home after a goalmouth scramble. Relive how West Brom beat Stoke here Stoke had two men sent off within the first 30 minutes in the reverse fixture in August and needless indiscipline proved costly again at The Hawthorns. The red card for Cameron, in reaction to a Yacob challenge, came much later in the game - the 82nd minute - but it followed within 60 seconds of substitute Walters heading an undeserved equaliser. From being in a position where they could have stolen an unlikely three points, Mark Hughes' men were forced back on to the back foot. The Baggies piled on the pressure, won a 93rd-minute corner and, after the ball pin-balled around the six-yard box, centre-half Evans tapped home his first goal for the club as Stoke appealed for offside in vain. Media playback is not supported on this device Former Stoke boss Tony Pulis has now lost only once in 11 matches when managing in this fixture after West Brom won their second game in a row to move further away from the relegation zone. The home team totally dominated the second half, having 11 shots to Stoke's three, and striker Rickie Lambert blew a great opportunity to put them 2-0 up when he miscontrolled after being put clean through. Walters punished them almost immediately, but Evans, who along with captain Darren Fletcher performed superbly throughout, was in the right place as Stoke became the final team this season to concede in the Premier League from a corner. Fletcher, who covered a match-high 11.03km, was key to the opening goal, winning possession and surging forward before finding James Morrison, who set up Sessegnon for his first league strike in over a year. Pulis' men kept 17 league clean sheets in 2015 and, although they could not do so in their first match of 2016, they looked secure at the back for virtually the whole game and climb to 12th, just three points behind Stoke. Stoke named an unchanged team for the third match in succession after wins over Manchester United and Everton but, having scored four at Goodison on Monday, offered little threat at The Hawthorns. Bojan, Marko Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri linked up brilliantly at Everton but Evans and Gareth McAuley virtually nullified them, with the Swiss managing one tame shot in the second half. Walters' goal came from nowhere, created by a rare moment of quality from fellow substitute Joselu, but they are still only four points from fifth-placed Manchester United in 10th and in a good position to climb the table in the second half of the season. Media playback is not supported on this device Stoke boss Mark Hughes: \"I don't think it was a high-quality game - we didn't play particularly well and I didn't think West Brom played particularly well. \"Geoff got caught late by the lad Yacob, he's just reacted to it and pushed the guy. We're not too happy with the reaction of the West Brom player. I think he went down really easily with the intention of maybe getting Geoff sent off, which he succeeded in doing. \"We'll look again tomorrow and we'll decide whether or not we appeal. At the moment, having seen it, that is probably what we will do.\" West Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"Stoke have been flying and are a real high-quality team and we are very pleased to win. \"The equaliser would have given them momentum but the lad being sent off means it goes back our way.\" West Brom host Bristol City in the third round of the FA Cup next Saturdaybefore a league trip to Chelsea on 13 January, while Stoke are at home to Liverpool in the first leg of their League Cup semi-final on Tuesday.

        "Unknown hackers carried out a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against Ukrposhta's website. The attack began on Monday morning, but ended shortly after 21:00 local time (1900 BST). However, Ukrposhta reported on Facebook that the DDoS attack continued again on Tuesday. \"Friends, we've been DDoSed,\" the company in a post on Tuesday. \"During the first wave of the attack, which began yesterday in the morning, our IT services could normalise the situation, and after 17:00, all the services on the site worked properly. \"But today, hackers are at it again. Due to their actions, both the website and services are working, but slowly and with interruptions.\" DDoS attacks occur when hackers flood a website's servers with a huge amount of web traffic, with the intent of taking the website offline. Attackers do this by secretly infecting computers, routers and Internet of Things-enabled devices, such as thermostats, washing machines and other home appliances, with malware and then roping the zombie computers into a botnet. \"With critical systems exposed to the internet and inadequate protection, denial of service attacks can have an impact way beyond taking a website down or preventing online transactions from taking place,\" Sean Newman, director of Corero Network Security, told the BBC. \"In this case, it was a service that was reportedly brought to its knees, but outcomes for other organisations could include manufacturing processes being interrupted or halted, potentially impacting productivity, quality and even safety. \"This serves to highlight how any organisation, including those which don't transact directly with consumers, can be seriously impacted by denial of service attacks. With the level of sophistication of today's attackers, and without the latest generation of always-on, real-time automatic DDoS protection, all organisations are vulnerable to DDoS attacks of all sizes and durations.\" This is not the first time that Ukraine's postal service has been targeted this year - in June, Ukrposhta was hit by the NotPetya ransomware attacks, as part of a wider national attack on Ukrainian banks, the state power provider, television stations and public transport services.",
        "The coins, which are known as Scottish groats, were discovered by keen metal detector Tom Crawford last January. They were buried about eight inches beneath the soil on a farm near Banbridge. Experts believe they are part of a larger hoard of coins found by Mr Crawford in the same field in 2001. The collection was probably dispersed over time through ploughing. This was Mr Crawford's fourth time at a treasure trove inquest. He said his success was about \"knowing where to go\" and \"having a fair idea of where to look.\" \"There is more chance of finding something where you know people would have been living 1,000 years ago,\" he added. He said discovering long-buried artefacts was a \"euphoric\" feeling. \"It's not so much the money, it's the fact that you are the first person to touch something in 700 years,\" he said. \"I found a 3,000-year-old bronze axe about 10 years ago and it's the idea that something has been hidden for so long and then you get to see it and touch it.\" Former curator at the Ulster Museum, Robert Heslip, said the hoard of coins was probably buried near a landmark - a small Rath ring fort. The person who left them may have died before reclaiming them. He said finds like this one are significant because they are specific to a particular time and to this part of Northern Ireland. \"You find virtually nothing like this in the south of Ireland and they peter out in the west,\" he said. \"There have been a cluster of these sorts of finds in eastern Ulster.\" The coins will now be sent to the British Museum in London for valuation. It is thought they are probably worth between PS50 and PS100 each. They will be offered for sale and any profit is split between the finder and the owner of the land where the treasure was uncovered.",
        "Ministers promised a response after AMs claimed the 2013 Active Travel Act had failed to achieve its potential due to a lack of funding and leadership. Healthy travel will be promoted in school lessons, public health campaigns, and investment decisions, backed up by monitored targets. Transport Minister Edwina Hart said there was a need for \"culture change.\" Local councils are obliged to provide routes for cyclists and walkers and to consider their needs when planning new road and rail links under the 2013 legislation. But there was \"considerable frustration\" among supporters of active travel at the lack of progress, the business and enterprise committee reported in February. Chairman William Graham claimed AMs felt the commitment of ministers had \"started to waver before it has properly begun.\" The Active Travel Action Plan published by the Welsh government on Tuesday sets out expectations in areas ranging from leadership and infrastructure to skills and training. An annual progress report will monitor how many more adults and children have been encouraged to take up walking or cycling. \"Increasing levels of walking and cycling offers many health and social benefits,\" said Mrs Hart. \"We know that most people in Wales currently make no or very few walking and cycling journeys. \"This plan sets out how we can achieve our ambition of making walking and cycling part of everyday life through a culture change, both within organisations, and among individuals, as well as action to reduce barriers to active travel.\"",
        "She was speaking after inquests concluded that 96 Liverpool fans were unlawfully killed in the disaster. \"The terrible events of Saturday 15 April 1989 shocked this country and devastated a community,\" she said. Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham said \"those responsible must be held to account.\" Calling for transparency about clashes between miners and police at Orgreave earlier in the 1980s, Mr Burnham said there had been a \"27-year cover-up.\" He said he did not believe the Hillsborough families would have the \"full truth\" until \"we know the truth about Orgreave.\" Ms May said it was not possible for MPs to understand what the Hillsborough families had been through. How the truth was uncovered Live updates and reaction Hillsborough: From tragedy to truth What happens next? She said for 27 years the families and survivors \"fought for justice from the authorities that should have been trusted, and have laid blame and tried to protect themselves.\" The families \"have never faltered,\" she said, and commended their courage, determination and resolve. \"No-one should have to endure what the families and survivors have been through and no-one should have to fight for year after year and decade after decade for the truth.\" She said: \"Clearly the jury's determination that those who died were unlawfully killed is of great public importance.\" \"It overturns in the starkest way possible the verdict of accidental death returned at the original inquests. \"However, the jury's findings do not, of course, amount to a finding of criminal liability, and no-one should impute criminal liability to anyone while the ongoing investigations are still pending.\" She read out the potential offences under investigation including gross negligence manslaughter, misconduct in a public office, perjury and perverting the course of justice. David Cameron said the inquests' conclusion \"marked a momentous day for the family and friends of the 96 victims.\" He said: \"Over the last 27 years, their search for justice has been met with obfuscation and hostility, instead of sympathy and answers. \"As I said to the House in 2012 about the Hillsborough Independent Panel's report, it's wrong that the families had to wait for so long and to fight so hard just to get to the truth. \"I know the whole house will want to join me in praising their courage, their patience and their resolve. They've never faltered in the pursuit of the truth and we all owe them a great debt of gratitude.\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to the \"dignity\" of campaigning relatives, praising their \"steadfastness and determination.\" Mr Burnham said there were three reasons how \"something so obvious\" was finally outlined 27 years later in the inquest jury's conclusions. He said: \"First, a police force which has consistently put protecting itself above protecting people harmed by Hillsborough. \"Second, collusion between that force and complicit print media. Third, a flawed judicial system that gives the upper hand to those in authority over and above ordinary people.\" The politicians were speaking after calls were made for senior police officers to be held accountable for the disaster. South Yorkshire Police said the force had made \"a full apology\" for its failures in 2012 and had \"stood by that ever since.\" In a statement, the force said Chief Constable David Crompton \"unequivocally accepted the jury's conclusions.\" A commemoration service will take place at Liverpool's St George's Hall from 17:45 BST. It will see 96 lanterns and 96 red roses left on the steps of the building in memory of the victims. Meanwhile, The Sun newspaper has been criticised for not carrying the story of the inquests' conclusions on its front page on Wednesday. The paper has long been criticised for running a front-page story headlined \"The Truth\" after the disaster, alleging some fans had picked victims' pockets and urinated on police. It ran a full-page apology in 2012 over its reporting of the disaster after years of criticism. Speaking after the jury's conclusions, former editor Kelvin McKenzie said he had been \"duped\" by false information at the time of the story, and was \"profoundly sorry for the hurt\" it had caused.",
        "The report by the UN Agency for Human Settlements says that the richest 20 of the population on average earn 20 times more than the poorest 20. According to the study, Guatemala is the country with the widest disparity, and Venezuela the most equitable one. The survey says the region is the world's most urbanised, with eight out of 10 people living in cities. The report, State of the Cities of Latin America, suggests that by 2050, nearly nine out of 10 Latin Americans will live in cities and its authors suggest Latin American nations use the current period of relative economic stability and slower population growth to make life in the cities more equitable. \"The main challenge is how to combat such huge disparities in the cities,\" Erik Vittrup of the UN Agency for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat) said. According to the study, income inequality in Latin America remains extremely high. \"There is a considerable job deficit and a large labour informality affecting mainly the young and women,\" it says. The report says that Colombia, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Argentina and Guatemala have all seen an increase in inequality between 1990 and 2009. But Mr Vittrup said there were some indications of a positive trend. \"We're at the end of an era of urban explosion, with few exceptions. \"We're seeing a reduction in poverty, indigence in urban areas; unemployment is going down,\" Mr Vittrup said.

        "Yanis Varoufakis last week confirmed that he worked on a contingency plan in case emergency funding to the Greek financial system was cut off. He has been accused of secretly planning a Greek exit from the euro. But Mr Tsipras said on Friday that he had ordered the plan, adding it would have been \"irresponsible\" not to do so. \"Of course I issued personal instructions to the finance minister to create a team that would work on a plan of defence in the event of a national emergency,\" Mr Tsipras told parliament, according to AP. \"It would have been politically naive.... not to do so. Does that mean.... that I was seeking an emergency?\" he asked. Mr Tsipras did not directly address the reported details of the plan, which was to have allowed the government to introduce a parallel payment system if the banking system was closed down and the drachma had to be re-introduced. A small team in the governing Syriza party was charged with investigating how to secretly copy online tax codes and use them to issue new pin numbers for every taxpayer, to be used in transactions with the state. \"That would have created a parallel banking system while the banks were shut as a result of the ECB's aggressive action to deny us some breathing space,\" Mr Varoufakis said in a leaked phone conversation. Mr Varoufakis later confirmed the existence of the plan, but denied claims that he had wanted to engineer a Greek exit from the euro. Earlier this month eurozone leaders agreed to offer Greece a third bailout of a'!86bn, after marathon talks in Brussels. However the details of the bailout remain to be negotiated between Greece and its creditors.",

        "\"The documentary for me started with the questions:'Is this the end of film? Is digital going to replace it? What are we losing if that happens and what are we gaining?, says Keanu Reeves. The actor serves as producer, narrator and interviewer on Side by Side, in which he sets out to examine cinema's transition from film to digital formats. It seems a niche subject, but Reeves and director Chris Kenneally say they were conscious about making the film for a mainstream audience. \"We wanted to take something that was quite specialised and share enough information so people could understand what we'd be speaking about,\" Reeves says. But does the average cinema-goer care or notice what format the film they're watching is in? \"If you're not an aficionado, probably not, as long as it was working,\" admits Reeves. \"If you go and expect to see a Hollywood studio movie and it looked terrible you'd go like,'what is that?' So I think it could impact in that sense. \"But a perfect film print projected is something that is remarkable and unique.\" Side By Side makes no assumptions that audiences will know the technical aspects of filmmaking, so spends some time explaining how cameras work, the photochemical process of developing film and how the introduction of digital cameras has led to the progression of editing and special effects. And helping to explain is a cast that reads like a Who's Who of cinema. Directors Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, David Lynch, James Cameron, Danny Boyle, George Lucas and cinematographers Wally Pfister (Inception, The Dark Knight) and Roger Deakins (Skyfall, True Grit) are all present. Female filmmakers are represented by the likes of legendary editor Anne Coates, who worked on movies like Lawrence of Arabia and The Elephant Man and Lena Dunham, one of Hollywood's hottest talents thanks to her TV show Girls. Reeves conducted a large share of the interviews himself, which not only helped the filmmakers gain such unprecedented access but also made for a series of relaxed, open conversations. \"I can't say it didn't help that I've been in the industry for however many years - I was a known quantity in that sense,\" he says. It took around 18 months to round up and interview all the film-makers. Luckily, a large number of contributors attended an annual cinematography festival in Poland. However others weren't so easy to get. Directors such as Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino are notably absent. \"There were people who weren't available or who didn't want to speak,\" he says. \"We got turned down a few times which sucked.\" Although mainstream Hollywood films have been shot digitally for about the last 12 years, the first digital film to win an Oscar for best cinematography was Slumdog Millionaire in 2009. Cinematography Oscars followed for Avatar in 2010 and Hugo in 2011 - also shot digitally. Some see this as a shift in the attitude towards digital film, which had previously been considered inferior in quality. Filming on celluloid is an expensive and time consuming process. Reels of film that each contain about 10 minutes of footage are developed overnight, creating \"dailies.\" Viewing them is the first chance a director will get to see the product of his previous day's work. It is only then they discover if they have the right shots or if they have to go back and re-shoot. The advent of video cameras showed not only that film-making could be done at a fraction of the cost, but that you could see the results immediately. It also enabled anyone to effectively become a film-maker. The invention of low price digital cameras further democratised the film-making process. However, advocates for celluloid include Inception director Christopher Nolan and cinematographer Wally Pfister, who maintain digital images will never have the depth or clarity of film, which they insist on using. On the other side, the likes of George Lucas, James Cameron and David Lynch profess their love for digital and swear they'll never go back. Another issue addressed in the documentary is digital film archiving and preservation - where the introduction of new formats every couple of years is proving to be problematic. Indeed, Se7en director David Fincher says he has videos from the early days of his career in unplayable formats, as the hardware no longer exists. As a result, when he finishes a film, he now stores the relevant player alongside the rushes in his archive, to ensure he is able to watch them back at a later date. And even with modern technology, hard drives can fail, leading to the loss of digital content. It is something Reeves admits he had not considered. \"I had no idea about the situation we're in right now where there is no standardised means of archiving digital information.\" \"I didn't know anything about how it could all just go away - it was a bit jaw-dropping.\" The irony is that celluloid is the only format that has stood the test of time over the past 100 years and will continue to do so as long as there are projectors to play them on. Throughout Side by Side, Reeves maintains his impartiality but with filming complete, he is able to share his thoughts. \"Going into the film I was definitely biased to'what are we losing?'. Film was being held up as the gold standard and digital was this idea of replacing [it],\" he says. \"But what I've come to learn is that it's not necessarily replacing it - but that it's something else. And if it is that, then film has a better chance. \"I'm still confident that it's going to hang around.\" Side By Side is out in cinemas from Friday, 15 February through Axiom Films.",

        "Alex D'Acol headed the hosts ahead early on from Ali Crawford's corner. Inverness had the chance to level after Darian MacKinnon fouled Billy Mckay in the box but Greg Tansey's penalty was saved by Gary Woods. Grant Gillespie converted Rakish Bingham's pass to double Accies' lead and Bingham added a goal of his own. Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors had been boosted by former striker Mckay's loan signing from Wigan being completed shortly before kick-off to allow him to play, but it was Accies who dominated as they welcomed back the experienced Mikey Devlin and Massimo Donati after injury. Both sides had been struggling to find a win, and the lack of confidence was evident for most of the first half, although Mckay blasted a volley into the side netting to give the small band of away fans some early hope. Before the match Hamilton boss Martin Canning had said the first goal would be hugely influential and it was his side who grabbed it with a well rehearsed move from Crawford's corner. D'Acol got away from his marker on the near post and his glancing header found the net past Owain Fon Williams for his seventh goal of the season. Caley Thistle then blew a major opportunity to equalise after referee Euan Anderson had pointed to the spot on 26 minutes. Woods guessed right, diving right to produce a superb save to deny Tansey. Accies then lost Crawford to injury just after the half-hour, with new signing Blair Adams taking his place and Gillespie taking on Crawford's midfield responsibilities. That move paid off after the interval when Bingham drove down the left, crossed low into the box and Gillespie timed his run superbly to send a side-foot shot past Fon Williams. Bingham then produced the best moment of the night, smashing a terrific 18-yard effort high past the Welsh goalkeeper for his fourth goal of the campaign, the Caley Thistle defence ripped apart and their fans starting to dread the long, late trip home. It was a first league win in 12 for Hamilton and only their third in the division this season. Meanwhile, Richie Foran has a major task ahead to convince his men that they can stay in a top flight becoming tougher and tougher as Inverness' winless league run stretched to the dozen mark. Media playback is not supported on this device Hamilton player-manager Martin Canning: \"The performance was similar to Saturday, but there were key moments there with the penalty save and the second goal, because we have not been taking the opportunity to get the second goal when we have had the chance so far this season. \"If we continue to make the big moments go in our favour and capitalise on them, then we can move up the table and continue to win games. \"We haven't punished teams, but tonight we did and we make it comfortable for ourselves and that should have probably happened four or five times this season. \"The league is so tight, we have gone from joint bottom to four points off the top six and it gives us a great incentive to go on and try to do something against Kilmarnock on Saturday.\" Inverness manager Richie Foran: \"That puts us into a relegation battle now - forget about top six, we are in a relegation battle now. \"Some of our players have not got the bottle, they showed that today. We might have been the better side in the first half and their keeper pulled off a great save from the penalty, but some of our boys are hiding and we are in for a fight now. \"I told them straight,'I can see who is bottling it, I can see who does not want to take the ball'. It is not them all - I thought Billy Mckay was excellent - but it makes it a massive game for us now on Saturday against Dundee. \"That was our worst defeat of the season. I'll take my share of the blame, but the players now need to stand up and be counted.\" Match ends, Hamilton Academical 3, Inverness CT 0. Second Half ends, Hamilton Academical 3, Inverness CT 0.

        "He is accused along with his son, Bello Abba Mohammed, of diverting 1.5m (PS1m) that was meant to buy arms for soldiers fighting Islamist Boko Haram militants. The two men have pleaded not guilty. President Muhammadu Buhari, who took office in May, set up an investigation into the procurement of weapons for the military which found that phantom contracts worth 2bn had been awarded. Last month, former national security adviser Sambu Dasuki was arrested and charged with 19 counts of fraud, money laundering and criminal breach of trust in connection to the case. Mr Dasuki, who oversaw the fight against Boko Haram while Goodluck Jonathan was president, denied the charges. Bello Haliru Mohammed served as Mr Jonathan's defence minister from 2011 to 2012 and still holds a senior position in the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). He appeared at the Abuja High Court on Tuesday in a wheelchair and was transferred to a hospital when the case was adjourned, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said. His son was remanded in prison until a bail hearing on Thursday. Boko Haram has killed thousands in north-eastern Nigeria in its six-year campaign to create an Islamic state. Soldiers had complained that despite the military's huge budget, they were ill-equipped to fight. The soldiers have reported that they are better equipped since President Buhari came into office, but the previous president's supporters say this is because those weapons were ordered while Mr Jonathan was in power, says the BBC's Abuja editor BBC's Bashir Sa'ad Abdullahi.",

        "Fujimori said in a letter he intended to share thoughts and memories, happy and sad, while serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations. The social media accounts would be managed by a group of supporters. The 75-year-old governed Peru for a decade before being impeached and fleeing the country in 2000. Peru's Justice minister, Daniel Figallo, reacted angrily to Fujimori's announcement. \"People who commit violations and have their liberty taken from them have their rights limited. Otherwise, we turn prisons into hotels,\" he told reporters. Mr Figallo reportedly asked the prison director to limit Fujimori's access to social media. The former leader still has supporters in Peru and vowed to reveal his thoughts online. \"In this way, I'll be able to share my thoughts, memories and illusions, sorrows and joys,\" his letter read. Peru's President Ollanta Humala recently rejected Fujimori's request for a pardon on humanitarian grounds. Earlier this week, the authorities rejected a bid by Fujimori's lawyer to have him transferred to house arrest. After being stripped of his powers by the country's Congress in 2000, the leader sought exile in Japan. He eventually returned to Chile, where he was arrested in 2005. After losing a lengthy legal battle, he was extradited to Peru in 2007 and convicted of human rights violations after a 15-month trial. He was accused of authorising death-squad killings in two incidents known as La Cantuta and Barrios Altos, and the kidnapping of a journalist and a businessman. Mr Fujimori repeatedly denied the charges, saying they were politically motivated.",

        "The RMT union began the 72-hour walkout on New Year's Eve. The action prompted warnings of widespread disruption for travellers during new year celebrations. Southern's parent firm Govia Thameslink (GTR) is in dispute with both the RMT and Aslef unions. Another strike is set for 9 January. The planned six-day strike involves train drivers from both unions. Most routes are expected to have no services. The train drivers' union Aslef is continuing with a ban on overtime which is adding to the disruption. The RMT and GTR have said they are available for talks and Aslef took part in negotiations in December at conciliation service Acas, but discussions ended without a deal. RMT leader Mick Cash called on Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to make it his new year resolution \"to get in a room with the unions and his contractors to sort out the current shambles.\" Mr Grayling said it was frustrating the unions had decided to start a new year with the continuation of an old strike. He said: \"We are investing record amounts in improving our railways and we need everyone in the rail industry to work together to deliver for passengers. \"Now the unions need to come back to the negotiating table. Only they can end this misery for rail users.\" Southern's deputy chief operating officer Alex Foulds said: \"Our door remains open for meaningful talks.\" The politics behind the Southern rail dispute What's the Southern Rail strike about? How bad have Southern rail services got? The Association of British Commuters said disruption had caused health problems, forced people to move house and lose jobs. The campaign group surveyed about 1,000 passengers and said the results highlighted the extent of suffering as a result of the \"breakdown\" of Southern services, with delays, cancellations and overcrowding. Calling for government intervention, a spokesman said: \"Thousands of people are now at breaking point.\" The Department for Transport has said the dispute is between Southern and the unions and \"not something the government is involved in.\"",

        "Procter made a dogged 137, his highest first-class score, and Alviro Petersen a sparkling 81 in a total of 465, a first-innings lead of 347. It would have been greater had it not been for a fiery and entertaining spell from Tino Best, who took 5-90. Jimmy Adams fell to Jimmy Anderson early in Hampshire's second innings as they closed on 22-1, 325 runs behind. Their quest to avoid an innings defeat will be aided by a surface that remains true, albeit with some turn on offer to the spinners. Indeed, the way Lancashire piled on the runs on a hot day further highlighted the inadequacy of Hampshire's meagre first-innings 109. Procter was at first in the company of Haseeb Hameed, who made a careful 62 before edging the impressive leg-spin of Mason Crane to slip, with Petersen then arriving to make batting look easier than anyone else in the match. While the South African busily accumulated and punished anything loose, Procter, favouring the leg side, registered his second first-class century. It was when Petersen was caught hooking Best that Lancashire began to slide in the face of some thrilling, hostile bowling from the West Indian. Procter was caught pulling, while Liam Livingstone had his stumps uprooted and James Anderson was comprehensively bowled. Faced with such a huge deficit, Hampshire instantly lost Adams, who edged a beauty from Anderson, before Michael Carberry and England hopeful James Vince watchfully ensured there were no further loses. Luke Procter told BBC Radio Lancashire: \"I'm over the moon. To get a century at Old Trafford was one of my boyhood dreams and it's come true. I didn't really think about it when I was out there. I just kept batting. \"The bowlers did a fantastic job for us in the first innings and then for us to put 450 on the board is fantastic. We just wanted to bat all day. There was no rush with how fast we got our runs. \"Haseeb is really good to bat with. He is calm and that calms you down. Alviro was great too. He puts the pressure back on the bowlers. When they come hard at us he goes back hard at them. \"Ashwell Prince batted at three last year and it's obviously big boots to fill bit I've really enjoyed it. I've had a few starts so it's good to get a century on the board.\" Tino Best told BBC Radio Solent: \"Mason Crane bowled beautifully. For a 19-year-old leg spinner to have that much control is amazing. England have produced a quality leg spinner. He is really one for the future. \"He kept it tight and it gave me the opportunity to really run in and express myself. That's why Hampshire have brought me. At the end of the day, you only have a short while to play this game and I'm 35 this summer. But I'm fit and strong and I'm always ready to go and to commit myself. \"The sun was warm, the wicket was flat and I thought to myself that this is just like first-class cricket in Barbados. But you still have to run in hard and bowl quick and that's what Hampshire are paying me to do. \"The best wicket for me was getting Steven Croft. He is a good player who can take the game away from you. Alviro Petersen was a prize wicket too. It was a good battle. West Indies versus South Africa. And I'm not going to back down. I knew he was going to play his pulls but I made sure he didn't pull me out of the park because I back myself. That was a big wicket as he is a class act.\"",

        "MI6 and and GCHQ advertised on the Mumsnet website for the first time this year, and MI5 has raised its target for women employees to 45 by 2021. Flexible working and the importance of \"high emotional intelligence\" are also being stressed in recruitment. The agencies were responding to calls from MPs to recruit more women. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee reported in March 2015 that 37 of intelligence agency staff were women and women only make up 19 of senior civil servants in the agencies. One year on, the government says that it and the agencies - internal security service MI5, external spy agency MI6 and the government listening post GCHQ - \"agree wholeheartedly\" with the need for \"diversity\" in agency staff. It says action has been taken since the report was published to \"increase their focus\" on \"all aspects of diversity,\" including recruiting more women. Recruitment targets, \"diversity champions,\" events such as a recent \"Women in Cyber\" event and more career support for female officers are part of efforts to employ more women and encourage talented existing women to apply for promotion. They also say they are doing more to \"promote a flexible working culture\" for men and women with childcare commitments and to allow women returning from maternity leave to take up their old jobs - including in intelligence roles. The three agencies also said they were always looking for \"new and innovative ways to recruit those with the right skills, mind-set and diversity of approach.\" MI5 had already used Mumsnet as well as local newspapers to target women \"not currently in work\" while the other two agencies did so for the first time this year. GCHQ has also removed a requirement of a 2:1 university degree from its \"fast-stream\" recruitment to encourage women who had followed a \"non-traditional graduate route.\" The government said the initiatives were having an effect as MI5 had recently been placed in the Times Top 50 employers for women and had increased its number of new female employees by 5 to 46 of new recruits. GCHQ had seen applications from women rise to 40. MI6 had increased its female recruitment targets for 201617 after seeing a 4 drop in women - to 41 of new recruits. The government also said career support for female staff was having a \"real impact\" with increased numbers of women applying for senior roles in MI5.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device United are unbeaten in 14 Premier League games but have drawn their past three and been sixth in the table after each round of matches since 6 November. \"Playing to win, having the responsibility to win, and coping with the pressure of winning is something that has to belong to your natural habitat,\" said Mourinho. \"For some guys, it doesn't.\" Six players in the Old Trafford club's first-team squad have not won a domestic league title or major international tournament - Luke Shaw, Matteo Darmian, Jesse Lingard, Ander Herrera, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford. Mourinho did not name any individuals but, speaking before Sunday's trip to champions Leicester (16:00 GMT kick-off), he said his squad contains players who \"need time to go out of a comfort or a protected zone where they don't think the aim is to win.\" Meanwhile, midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has been added to United's Europa League squad after being left out for the group stages. The 32-year-old former Germany captain will now be available for the last-32 tie against St Etienne later this month. Having signed four players last summer, United did not buy anyone during the January transfer window - but Mourinho has identified the men he wants in the summer. In recent seasons, United have become embroiled in negotiations with Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos and forward Gareth Bale, and midfielder Cesc Fabregas when he was at Barcelona, but the Mourinho says he will not chase \"impossible\" transfers. \"I know what I want and I am very realistic,\" said the Portuguese. \"I know what are the impossible targets and I don't like my club to participate in them. \"It is a waste of time. It is a gift to the agents to help them improve their situation.\" Simon Stone, BBC Sport Given they have been in sixth place since early November, there is a real possibility that United will fail to qualify for the Champions League for a second successive year. That would cost them more than PS20m in sponsorship income due to a clause in their PS750m, 10-year deal with Adidas, but is unlikely to impact on their ability to attract top-class players because of Mourinho's reputation and the club's ability to pay top salaries. Mourinho's priorities will be to bring in at least one \"game-changing forward\" and bolster his defence significantly. Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann has been heavily linked, although United officials have played down a story from France that personal terms with the 25-year-old have already been agreed. A formal move for Benfica's Victor Lindelof is anticipated after United ruled out a January move for the 22-year-old Sweden defender due to his near PS40m buyout clause. Monaco defensive midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko is also of interest to Mourinho, with England winger Ashley Young and Schweinsteiger top of the list of likely departures.",
        "Kitchens, toilets and washing facilities haven been installed at Tredegar Park with the first demonstration expected on Saturday, five days before the summit. More than 150 heads of state and ministers will attend the two-day event at Newport's Celtic Manor Resort. Police have taken over Rodney Parade sports ground to manage extra policing. Security for the summit will be provided by 9,500 police officers drawn from 43 UK police forces with 12 miles (20km) of security fencing already in place at keys sites in Cardiff and in Newport. But the million dollar question is how many campaigners will descend on Newport, according to Eddie Clarke, of the No Nato Newport group. He is one of a core of 100 volunteers from several campaign groups such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), who have set up the campsite in anticipation of their supporters needing somewhere to pitch tents while staying in Newport to protest their cause in front of world leaders and media. Groups like Stop the War have organised coaches with peace campaigners being driven in from London, Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle. They also expect campaigners to come from further afield with a Counter Summit on Sunday including speakers representing peace movements in the US and Russia in their bid to \"end the drive to war and military spending.\" Newport council said it had been given assurances the camp will be a \"peaceful encampment\" and will not interfere with the park's normal activities. A spokesperson said: \"Newport City Council is continuing to work with partner agencies to monitor the situation and minimise the impact of such a camp.\" Gwent Police have taken over Rodney Parade sports ground to help manage the huge security operation already described as \"unchartered territory\" by the office in charge. A police spokesperson told the South Wales Argus it was one of a number of local venues being used for various activities, including booking officers on and off duty, briefings, and canteen facilities. The Nato security operation budget would pick up the bill for hiring the facility which is the home of the Newport Gwent Dragons, Newport County FC and Newport RFC, the spokesperson added.",
        "Reports of a \"mass murder\" investigation in France and pictures of German policemen carting bags of evidence from his parents' home suggest that officials are determined to find out. But this appears to be a case of murder-suicide, which is very different and extremely rare. In these incidents, one person wishing to end their life takes the lives of others - in this case, complete strangers - at the same time. The statistics show that most murder-suicides happen in domestic settings, and involve a man and his spouse. Murder-suicides involving pilots or in gun massacres are, in fact, much, much rarer. What drives people to these acts is therefore virtually impossible to determine because there is no common theme and the perpetrators don't leave notes explaining their actions. In contrast to the motivations of a suicide bomber, which are intentionally well-publicised, those behind a murder-suicide are usually more difficult to fathom. No-one, of course, can pretend to know what was in Lubitz's mind as he locked the cockpit door and instigated the plane's devastating descent. Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says it's unlikely we will ever know. \"It's possible something will emerge, but in most suicides people leave clues or a message. \"Incredibly extreme events like this are sometimes just inexplicable.\" Despite this, the media has been quick to point the finger at Lubitz's history of depression. German newspapers have also reported that he had received psychiatric treatment and may have been experiencing a \"personal life crisis.\" In reality, there is a multitude of factors, feelings and personality traits which could push someone to such an extreme course of action. Alcohol problems, drug misuse, broken relationships or marriages, personality disorders, work stresses - in the past or at the time of the act - can all play a part. Mental health charities agree, and have been queuing up to plead for more understanding about depression, and less sensationalist language. They say the vast majority of people with depression do not hurt anyone, and research shows that their risk is primarily to themselves. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, says: \"There are thousands of people with a diagnosis of depression, including pilots, who work, hold positions of high responsibility and who present no danger whatsoever. \"We do not know what part depression played in this tragedy but it is a condition that should never be trivialised.\" Charities said there was a danger that mental health problems could be stigmatised by coverage of the crash, making people more afraid to talk about their experiences. Dr Paul Keedwell, consultant psychiatrist and specialist in mood disorders, also says mental health problems are not a sufficient explanation for what happened. \"Among cases of murder-suicide in general, the rate of previously diagnosed depression varies from 40 to 60, depending on the context.\" But he does say that of those who are depressed, very few are being treated for it. It is clear that men find it particularly difficult to seek help if they have a history of mental illness. In the UK, for example, 75 of suicides are in men. Lubitz passed the tests set by his employer which indicated he was fit to fly, but it has since come to light that he may have been hiding an illness from them. This illness and his seeming inability to talk about it or come to terms with it may hold some small clue to his actions. But, in reality, there is never going to be an adequate explanation for murder-suicides - particularly for the families of those killed.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better. But that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don't know what's what: you might be in the driver's seat but your hands aren't on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there's a brick on the accelerator pedal. Another way of looking at it is that Fury's crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman's stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope. But not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it's anyone's guess as to when - if ever - he'll have his keys back and his engine revving again. Fury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock. When I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as \"an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me. An idiot, maybe?\" Hardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people. Fury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won't be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice. The repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional After pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn't train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old. Jess Willard's victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas's upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn't fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey. Sometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn't been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain. Media playback is not supported on this device In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a \"witch hunt\" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury's sometimes rambling trains of thought. Before and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury's controversial outbursts. As such, the repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury's performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right. But the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what's happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in. When Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers. Fury's camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations.\" How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship? In threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday's Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it's in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs? If you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury's Traveller heritage doesn't come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned. \"I know Tyson personally and he's a really nice guy,\" says Ricky Hatton, Fury's fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. \"But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous.\" Fury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation's mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua's brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them. However, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable. When you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him. On Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC's general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, \"cocaine is against the law of the land.\" There was also Fury's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn't be anywhere near a boxing ring. It should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing's image to think about - as mad as that sounds. Even if Fury hadn't voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them. It might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: \"We can't have a belt held hostage.\" One can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused. \"Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him,\" was Hatton's grim assessment. \"He doesn't like boxing and finds the training hard. It's not looking good. \"But I was in a dark place, didn't care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same.\" Fingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device Substitutes Cian Bolger and Ashley Hunter and Amari'i Bell all netted in the first half of extra time as Fleetwood booked their place in the second round on boss Uwe Rosler's 48th birthday. The result was harsh on the visitors who started well although Fleetwood looked content to grind down the opposition and their patience was rewarded before the break. Devante Cole skipped past Ryan Higgins, cutting in from the right and delivering a ball to the back post where Aaron Amadi-Holloway was lurking. The striker did not make clean contact but his deflected finish was enough to hand the League One side the lead. The second half was all Southport and former Fleetwood forward Jamie Allen should have levelled when a defensive mistake left him unmarked five yards out, with goalkeeper Alex Cairns springing to the rescue for under-fire Fleetwood. With four minutes remaining the visitors were rewarded for their pressure, as substitute Ashley Grimes barged through a crowded box and smashed Southport level from close range. But Fleetwood hit back, with Hunter's curling strike forcing a fine save from Norman. It was a brief reprieve for Steve Burr's men, Hunter drilling the resulting corner into the path of makeshift striker Bolger, who scored with a powerful header. Hunter then sealed Fleetwood's progress two minutes later, racing clear on a slick breakaway and smashing the ball low under Norman. Hunter was instrumental as Rosler's League One side further skewed the scoreline, stealing in from the left to tee up Bell for a deflected fourth. Report supplied by the Press Association.

        "But wins for Kent and Lancashire later in the evening meant they were eliminated from the competition. Colin Ingram hit 102 off 93 balls in Glamorgan's 251-9, with James Harris taking 4-38 against his old club. But Malan and Paul Stirling (58) began Middlesex's reply with a stand of 139 as they reached 255-2 in 39.4 overs. Stirling was caught off Kieran Bull and paceman Dewi Penrhyn Jones, playing only his second game for the Welsh county, had Sam Robson lbw for 22. By then, however, it was far too late with Malan in full cry at the other end and he hit four sixes, one of them striking the top-tier balcony, and 18 fours in his 128-ball innings. Neil Dexter finished the game in style by clearing the rope from a free-hit following a no-ball by Penrhyn Jones, whose 6.4 overs cost him 73 runs. Middlesex seamer James Harris told BBC Wales Sport: \"We played really well from start to finish after losing the toss, bowled really well upfront and never let Glamorgan get away from us, I managed to get a few cheap wickets at the end. \"For us to finish it off with a bit of style and for Dawid (Malan) to play so well, it was a very satisfying day. \"For Dawid to start like that and build an innings, when you have 140 on the board before you lose a wicket you're going to win a lot more one-day matches than you lose. Then for him to carry on and score 150 was pretty special.\" Glamorgan century-maker Colin Ingram told BBC Wales Sport: \"It's always nice to come to Lord's, it's a good day out and I just kept working hard. When you're playing well it's key to realise that and try to extend it as long as possible. I was fortunate again to do that today and thoroughly enjoyed it.\" \"It was nice to see two young guys (spinners Andrew Salter and Kieran Bull) do well, so that's invaluable experience for them and even some of the other younger guys, it'll be a good experience if a harsh one.\"",
        "McCann left the club three days ago having guided them to Premiership safety in a five-week spell in charge. The 42-year-old had indicated he was going back to his previous role as a television pundit. \"I have had time to think about the opportunity of being manager of Dundee FC full-time and decided it was too good for me to turn down,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to being in charge for the new season and work has already begun on a number of fronts. I'm excited about the future and can't wait to get started.\" McCann took over from the sacked Paul Hartley on 18 April with the club sitting in the relegation play-off spot. However, the former Dark Blues winger won his first two games as interim manager and drew a third, before rounding off the league campaign with two defeats. Dundee managing director John Nelms said the club had been \"inundated with applications\" for the role and that, after discussions \"with a number of candidates,\" McCann had been the club's \"number one choice.\" Following McCann's initial decision to step down, St Mirren rejected a request by the Taysiders to speak to their manager Jack Ross.",
        "Haydn Harwood, 33, says the black spiders are in \"every nook and cranny\" of the outside walls of his house and garage in Llanedeyrn. He said his wife, Kayleigh, and any family members who visit are afraid of venturing into the garden. Tube spiders are one of the UK's largest, with bodies up 2.2cm (0.9in), with green iridescence on their jaws. Mr Harwood first spotted the colony at his end-of-terrace home a year ago. He said: \"They are nocturnal creatures so I hadn't seen them until one night when I was outside having a cigarette because I am not allowed to smoke in the house. \"I saw something move, went in and got a flashlight and saw them all in the cracks of the walls. They were in the eaves, all along the back wall, down the side of the house and under the kitchen window. \"It is a bit of worry for our pets. \"We have two cats and a Chihuahua and it would be terrible if they got bitten by them. Tube web spiders - Segestria florentina He asked a friend for help to exterminate them but within three months the colony had returned. Mr Harwood said he has asked Cardiff council for help. Experts say the spiders originated in the Mediterranean and north Africa and made their way to Britain on cargo ships. They believe the spiders are now able survive and spread because of the UK's increasingly mild climate.",
        "The Save Oxfordshire Children's Centres Campaign \"baby blockade\" is against Oxfordshire County Council plans to cut the number of centres to save PS8m. Organiser Jill Huish said more than 500 people were \"definitely seen and heard\" when they took part in the march through Oxford on Saturday. David Cameron had been invited to join the protest after saying he was \"disappointed\" by the cuts. The council has said it will continue to support the most vulnerable families in Oxfordshire. Under the proposals, the authority would replace 44 existing centres with eight \"children and family centres\" located in the neediest areas of Oxfordshire. The PM wrote to council leader Ian Hudspeth last month calling it \"counter-productive\" and urging the authority to \"move cautiously in setting out its budget plans.\" In his response, Mr Hudspeth said the council's grants from government had fallen and that it had already made back-office savings. Ahead of the protest, Jill Huish, on behalf of the campaign group, wrote an open letter to Mr Cameron saying: \"We welcome your efforts to help protect these services, however perhaps like us you are rapidly losing confidence in government.\" \"Please join us in the streets,\" her letter urged. \"Cameron can't plead not guilty. Let's be clear, he is not just a local constituency MP, he is the prime minister. \"It's just not good enough..... we cannot keep mum and watch the 44 children's centres in Oxfordshire be closed down,\" she said. When asked to comment on the open letter, a government spokesperson said: \"There is still significant scope for sensible savings across local government to be made by back-office consolidation, disposing of surplus property and joining up our local public services. \"The government continues to work with councils to help deliver these savings and protect frontline services.\"",
        "Margaret Slater, who has dementia, was taken to Queen's Medical Centre Nottingham suffering severe hallucinations. Her family said there appeared to be too many patients for the number of staff with queues of people in the hallways and waiting areas. In a statement the trust apologised and said there was a \"surge\" in patients. Ms Slater was taken to the emergency department on 11 November during a week when the Nottingham University Hospital's Trust missed its admissions target every day. 3,870 emergency patients seen in week beginning 9 November 80.7 admitted to ward within four hours over the week 74.1 admitted within four hours on the Wednesday 95 should be admitted within four hours according to the government She was assessed by a nurse when she first arrived and then, three hours later, a doctor said she needed to be admitted but it was another eight hours before she was moved to a ward. Linda Hughes, her daughter, said the staff were \"very caring\" but there did not appear to be enough of them. \"It was only due to the pressure we were putting on them that she was moved to a ward. In that time she was offered nothing to eat or drink. \"At one stage, we counted about a dozen [patients on trolleys] and more queuing outside in a corridor with paramedics.\" In the week beginning 9 November, the hospital had 3,870 emergency admissions with 80.7 treated within four hours. The government target is 95. On the Wednesday, when Ms Slater was at QMC, the figure was 74.1. Alun Harcombe, divisional director of medicine, said the hospital was fully staffed but there had been a \"surge in people attending,\" leading to longer admissions times. \"We apologise to Ms Slater and her family for the long wait and that she was not offered any food or drink and have reminded our staff of the importance of doing so at regular intervals,\" he added.",

During the works, about 50,000 tonnes of material will be laid on the 2.9km (1.8 mile) runway. Traditionally, airports close for up to 14 days to carry out such work. Airport bosses said completing the refurbishment over several weekends rather than all at once was the \"best way to avoid major disruption.\" The closures were agreed following two years of discussions with retailers and airlines, airport management added. \"Some of our retail partners are refurbishing their shops which they wouldn't be able to do when the airport is open,\" said Jack Kelly from EMA. \"We've made sure flights can come in ahead of the closure and more flights can go out after it, so we are limiting the amount of disruption.\" The runway was last refurbished in 1999 and has a lifespan between 12 to 17 years. Engineers will also be replacing 1,200 lights around the runway with LEDs. The runway will be divided up into seven sections, with one chunk being repaired and sealed off each weekend.",
        "John Clancy, Labour councillor for Quinton, beat closest rival Penny Holbrook in Monday night's ballot. Ahead of the vote, he said providing new homes and improving existing social housing should be the authority's \"top priority.\" He will officially replace Sir Albert Bore on 1 December. Mr Clancy, who has bid to become leader of the city council several times, was chosen in the ballot by the authority's 78 Labour councillors. Updates on this story and others on Birmingham and Black Country Sir Albert announced he would stand down as head of the self-styled \"largest local authority in Europe.\" A close call for a man waiting in the wings for more than a decade. John Clancy has become leader of the Labour group after five attempts - and by just one vote. He will officially become leader of Birmingham City Council on 1st December when it's ratified at full council. An English teacher for many years, he's no stranger to working in the public sector but he also had a spell as a solicitor, as well as a business lecturer. His big message at a hustings last week was the council under his leadership can provide smarter financial decisions, political openness and free school meals for all primary age children. Some critics from within the party are already saying they're worried he won't have the clout or the vision to make the huge and rapid improvement needed to keep government commissioners at bay. The former Labour group leader's departure followed two other senior party figures, who resigned after criticising the way city was being run. Ian Ward, the deputy leader of the local authority and councillor Barry Henley also stood for the position. Mr Clancy, a former teacher and lecturer, has also pledged to widen access to free school meals for primary school children and expand regeneration outside the city centre. Birmingham City Council has found itself under scrutiny from a government-appointed independent panel. The panel was appointed at Sir Bob Kerslake's recommendation to oversee changes at the council. Sir Bob's study was commissioned after a series of reports focussed on the council during an inquiry into the so-called Trojan Horse letter.",

        "Kirsty Williams told them they have a \"responsibility as stewards of community, city and country,\" at a speech in Cardiff. The referendum showed \"notions of togetherness\" were \"perhaps weaker than we imagined,\" she warned academics. The Conservatives said she had offered some \"nuggets of wisdom\" but was \"exaggerating a sense of crisis.\" Universities and the Ms Williams campaigned for the UK to remain an EU member before the vote in June. However, Brexit was backed by 52.5 of voters in Wales, with 47.5 supporting Remain. On Monday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said Wales must get away from the abuse and bitterness of the referendum campaign. Speaking at Cardiff University on Thursday, Ms Williams claimed there was an \"urgency\" for universities to \"recapture a civic mission\" after the Leave vote. She suggested the existence of much of what is taken for granted in modern life might not be as secure as many people believe. \"The victories that help bend the arc of history towards progress - feminism, opening up access to education, civility in our discourse and towards others, civil rights, even devolution - may be far more fragile than we imagined,\" Ms Williams said. \"The vote showed that when people and communities think advancements are for the benefit of others - rather than for them, their families or society at large - they will think they have nothing to lose by standing against these.\" Urging colleges to do more to reach out to people across Wales, Ms Williams said the referendum exposed the \"distance between campus and community.\" She warned: \"At a UK-level, the pro-EU campaign of universities was too easily dismissed as one of self-interest, almost exclusively focused on income. \"This is not to exempt politicians and government from criticism, far from it. But it is certainly incumbent on universities to reflect on the distance between campus and community exposed by the referendum.\" Ms Williams has also announced she is establishing a Welsh Higher Education Brexit Working Group, to advise on the \"impact and possibilities\" arising from the UK's departure from the European Union. Six years ago the then Education Minister Leighton Andrews said university governance was \"the last resting place of the crachach\" - elitist and detached from mainstream Welsh society. In her first big address to university bosses, Education Secretary Kirsty Williams's tone was distinctly less confrontational. But her more nuanced message still displayed a view in government that institutions getting millions in public money should do more for their communities and the nation. \"They can't hide behind the walls of their very fine buildings - they have to be a part of the communities in which they are placed and the country as a whole - they recognise that,\" she told me afterwards. The EU referendum - in which the universities argued strongly to stay in - is one example of the divide between campus and community, she says. The universities' response is to say they are committed to bridging the gap and will build on what they already do in their communities. And both government and universities will hope the Diamond Review on higher education finance, due to report later this month, will go some way to resolving the tensions between them over funding. Conservative education spokesman Darren Millar accused the minister of \"exaggerating a sense of crisis and division.\" \"There are some nuggets of wisdom in this speech, and few would argue that the gap between campus and community has widened over the course of a generation,\" he said. \"However, the suggestion that Wales' decision to leave the EU has somehow placed education, civil rights or feminism under threat is absolute nonsense.\" Cardiff University vice chancellor Prof Colin Riordan, who chairs Universities Wales, said: \"Being part of and contributing to community has always been at the heart of what we do as universities.\" He added: \"We are proud of our successes, but we can do more to embrace and appreciate the cultural and social diversity of the communities within which we sit.\"",

        "Odion Ighalo put the hosts in front from close range, only for Antonio to level with a solo effort moments later. Matej Vydra restored the Hornets' lead from the spot after he was brought down by Kelvin Wilson. But Antonio levelled again, heading in Chris Burke's cross to leave new Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic with four points from his first two games. Media playback is not supported on this device Watford are now on an unbeaten run of seven games, which has been overseen by three different head coaches, with Oscar Garcia leaving at the end of September and his replacement Billy McKinlay making way for Jokanovic two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Stuart Pearce's Forest have fallen away from the top two to sixth, with their last league victory coming at home to Fulham on 17 September, and they started slowly as Fernando Forestieri and Vydra both forced saves from Karl Darlow. A David Vaughan free-kick that was deflected narrowly wide was Forest's only response before Ighalo had the Hornets in front - and his third goal in his last three games - by poking in Gianni Munari's superb back-flick from Almen Abdi's cross. Media playback is not supported on this device The lead lasted just two minutes though, as Abdi gave the ball away to Antonio who strode forward and finished from a tight angle, before Michael Mancienne seemed to be fortunate to get just a booking for bringing down Vydra when he was through on goal. Shortly after the break Vydra was brought down by Wilson and the Czech calmly rolled in from 12 yards to restore the lead. And the Hornets looked relatively comfortable afterwards, moving the ball around with confidence, until Burke did well to find space down the right and swung in a hanging cross that Antonio powered in at the back post for his eighth of the season. Vydra's shot straight at Darlow was as close as Watford came to a late winner, and they drop down to second after Derby's win at Blackpool. Watford head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: \"I think we played very well in the first 60 minutes. The last 30 minutes we lost a bit of tactical order and tried to win the game with hearts and not minds. \"For me [the Mancienne foul] was 100 a sending off. It's the same with the penalty. For me both situations are sendings off.\" Forest assistant manager Steve Wigley: \"It was a good point. We knew we were coming to a team that was in the best form they've been in this season. \"We knew we would have to play well and resolute is a good word to describe us. We showed a lot of character.

        "Mons Graupius in AD 83 or 84 saw the 9th Hispana, its cohorts and Roman cavalry defeat 30,000 Caledonians. Locations suggested in the past include Dunning in Perthshire, Carpow in Fife, Bennachie in Aberdeenshire and Culloden in the Highlands. Historic Scotland said an accurate site was needed for inclusion on its list. The body has commissioned research on Mons Graupius along with a number of other battle sites. It has already placed several battlefields including Bannockburn in 1314 and Culloden in 1746 on Scotland's Inventory of Historic Battlefields and earlier this month put out 11 other sites for public consultation. The list, which includes details on the boundaries and armies involved, will act as a guide to planning authorities. Historic Scotland's Dr Lesley MacInnes, said a decision had still to be made on whether Mons Graupius should be put forward for consideration as an entry on the inventory. The head of battlefields said: \"We have recently commissioned the research for a number of battlefields including Mons Graupius. \"The research will review all available evidence for these sites to establish if they meet the published criteria for inclusion in the inventory. \"Early sites such as Mons Graupius present particular challenges for accurate location which is one of the required criteria for inclusion.\" Dr MacInnes added: \"Any sites which are considered to be of national importance but cannot be accurately located cannot be included at this stage but will be kept under review should further information emerge to allow their inclusion. \"The research outcome for Mons Graupius will be clarified by the end of the financial year.\" Mons Graupius is believed to be wrapped up in the mysterious disappearance of the 9th Hispana in AD 120. The legion, cohorts of auxiliary light infantrymen from Gaul and Batavia along with cavalry were heavily outnumbered by Caledonians at the battlefield. However, the tactics of Roman general Gnaeus Julius Agricola left 10,000 tribesmen dead but relatively light casualties among the auxiliaries. There has been a long running debate on where the battle was fought. In his book Legions of Rome, historian Stephen Dando-Collins said no location has been \"reliably fixed.\" Potential sites have been weighed up on the website Roman Scotland. It rates Dunning the most likely and Culloden among the least. Sites close to the Grampian mountains have also been suggested in the past. In his book, Dando-Collins connects Mons Graupius with the disappearance of the 9th after it was later posted to Carlisle. He said Caledonians had sought revenge for the defeat and ambushed and slaughtered the legion along with its affiliated units. Mystery surrounding the fate of the 9th inspired Rosemary Sutcliff's children's book Eagle of the Ninth and two recent films - The Eagle and Centurion. Scenes for The Eagle starring Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell were shot around Achiltibuie and Old Dornie, near Ullapool, and in the Cairngorms for Centurion.",
        "Researchers said field experiments showed that severe droughts could trigger dieback of forests in the near-term. Efforts to curb deforestation needed to be accompanied by initiatives to stop land management fires spreading into adjoining forest reserves, they added. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Co-author Paulo Brando, a researcher from Brazil's Amazon Environmental Research Institute and the Woods Hole Research Center, US, explained that the findings were based on data gathered from a long-running field experiment, described as the first of its kind. In 2004, the team established three plots in the south-east Amazon - one of which was burned annually, another was burned every three years, while the remaining one was left untouched as a control plot. \"If we burned every year, we did not have enough fuel (leaves and trees) to drive a high intensity fire - fires that will kill a lot of trees - so we published a few papers saying that this kind of forest was quite fire resistant,\" explained Dr Brando. But he told BBC News that the team was surprised in 2007: \"We burned both plots (fourth burn for the annual plot and second burn for three-year plot) and both plots responded really strongly to the fires. \"There was a shift in the system from a forest to a savannah-like environment... grasses were invading the forest and there were fundamental changes within the ecosystem. He added that drought conditions during that year triggered the change: \"There were more leaves and twigs on the ground, they were drier so the fires were quite intense. \"To our surprise, the major effects were not observed in the plot we burned every year but rather in the one we burned every three years. \"This was because there was more time for fuel accumulation, and also it was because the productivity of that plot was still quite high, whereas in the [annual burn] plot, the fuel was being removed every year and the productivity of the system was reduced.\" Changing landscape Dr Brando said the abrupt high tree-mortality rates had a lasting impact on the landscape as grasses invaded the space once occupied by trees. \"You do not need drought anymore to observe high density fires because grasses can accumulate way more fuel than the native, wood vegetation,\" he explains. As well as observing the loss of a number of tree species, Dr Brando said there were wider ecological consequences as a result of losing tree cover. \"Burned plots were four degrees warmer because they had fewer leaves and less capacity to cool down the system through photosynthesis,\" he observed. \"So we have seen major changes, not only in species composition but in the functionality of the forest as well; it cycles less water because it is warmer and stores less carbon.\" Climate models suggest that the probability of severe droughts in the region are likely to be much more common by the end of the century. At an international conference held at the University of Oxford in 2012, researchers presented findings that suggested tropical forests in Africa could be more resilient to future climate change than the Amazon and other forested regions. Scientists at the gathering concluded that tree species in Africa's tropical forests had endured a number of climatic catastrophes over the past 4,000 years. During that period, the African forests had lost species that would have been potentially vulnerable, while the remaining species were \"relatively adaptable.... to quite rapid changes in rainfall,\" explained conference organiser Yadvinder Malhi, from the university's Environmental Change Institute. Responding to Dr Brando's findings, Prof Malhi said: \"Much of current scientific opinion suggests that intact tropical forests may be quite resilient to climate change, but the combination of climate change, land-use change and fire may be much more destructive. Prof Malhi, who was not involved in the study, added that these ideas have rarely been demonstrated in practice. \"What is unique about this study - a long-term experiment that took a lot of stamina and persistence to implement - is that it directly demonstrates the effects of this deadly combination of factors, and enables exploration of the details of the ecological processes and interactions involved,\" he told BBC News.",
        "Chris Dent's 100 off 111 balls was the backbone of Gloucestershire's total of 260 all out. In reply, an 87-run fourth-wicket stand between Johann Myburgh (81) and James Hildreth (48) had the hosts on course until six wickets went down for 32. But Jamie Overton put on 65 for the last wicket with Tim Groenewald as Somerset claimed victory on 263-9. Overton made 40 and Groenewald hit 34 in an unbroken stand of 65 off 49 balls, the second highest 10th-wicket stand to win a one-day match in England. After the trophy holders were put into bat by their neighbours, Dent played exceptionally well whilst his teammates fell around him, reaching three figures off 107 balls before being caught at cover off Groenewald. Spinner Roelof van der Merwe starred for the home side, running out Iain Cockbain as well as dismissing Benny Howell, Tom Smith and bowled Craig Miles off the final ball of Gloucestershire's innings. The visitors reduced their local rivals to 15-2 as Adam Hose and Peter Trego fell cheaply. But they rallied well until Myburgh picked out long-off off Dent to fall for 81 and begin a middle-order implosion. Lewis Gregory was then superbly run out and Hildreth was caught and bowled by Smith in the next over as Somerset fell from 166-3 to 198-9. But, with 63 still needed to win, Overton and Groenewald refused to go down without a fight in this local derby, finding the boundary with ease. They survived one near miss when, with the hosts still needing 13 off 3.1 overs, wicketkeeper Gareth Roderick missed a golden opportunity to run out last man Groenewald.",
        "Thick smoke has been billowing from the fire in Slitting Mill Road in Rugeley, Staffordshire, since the blaze began on 5 September. The fire service said a controlled burn was taking place over fears water supplies could be contaminated. It is not known how long it will take to put the fire out. More updates on this and other stories in Staffordshire Resident Steve Povey said he and others were also concerned about \"something toxic\" in the air that could affect people's long-term health, including his pregnant daughter. Alison Shaw, manager of the nearby Horns Inn, said the pub's takings were also down because of the blaze. \"Last week alone we have been down PS3,000.... we're very angry about it.\" MP for Cannock Chase Amanda Milling also said it was \"unacceptable\" the fire was still burning. The fire service said it was informed there was to be a two-hour controlled burn on the land on 5 September, but later received a 999 call to say it had got out of control. Dermot Hogan, group manager of Staffordshire Fire Service, said he was aware of residents' frustrations. Crews have been smothering part of the fire with soil, using foam to suppress the smoke and trying to remove burnt waste, he said. The Environment Agency said there were fears the water run off could contaminate the local watercourse and potentially impact groundwater supplies. Staffordshire County Council confirmed the land owner was instructed to remove rubbish from the site in June, and has since been served with enforcement notices.",
        "The 76-year-old, who received the PS25,000 prize for Squint (19) at Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery, was one of the shortlisted artists in 1991. Simpson, who has also made the prize longlist on three other occasions, said finally winning was \"very nice indeed.\" Judge Ansel Krut said Squint (19) was \"quite extraordinary,\" even though it was a \"difficult painting to look at.\" The work depicts a leper squint, which Simpson said were \"holes made in the sides of medieval churches so the undesirables could look through to the service and somehow take part.\" He said it was one of a series of paintings he has been working on, some of which were \"much bigger.\" The relatively small size of Squint (19) - which is about 7ft (2.1m) in height - was one of the reasons Simpson entered it into the competition, though he also admitted that it \"seemed to be a good idea to send one that I was conversant with and was working with.\" He said the prize money would be spent on \"stretches, canvas and - particularly - good quality paints.\" \"I spend a lot of money on materials, so this money is going to go to a good cause.\" Krut said Simpson's piece was \"a little bit like a tone poem - when you spend some time with it, it gradually starts to build a picture.\" \"Technically, it's very subtle and his language is very minimal, very reduced, but when you enter into it, you get into this broad field of great sympathy, because of the subject matter. \"We couldn't have asked for a better painting.\" Established in 1957, the biennial John Moores Painting Prize is one of Britain's oldest art awards. Previous winners include David Hockney and Peter Doig. Sir Peter Blake, who is now the prize's patron, won the junior title in 1961.",
        "A victim is taking legal action to force an independent inquiry with power to compel witnesses and the security services to hand over documents. Gary Hoy was abused by two men who were subsequently convicted. There have been allegations that a paedophile ring at Kincora was linked to the British intelligence services. The government has so far refused calls for the abuse scandal at the Belfast home to be included within the scope of the inquiry established by Home Secretary Theresa May and headed by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard. The government has said that as child protection is a devolved matter, the right place for the Kincora allegations to be examined is Northern Ireland's Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, which has been sitting in Banbridge. The victims of Kincora claim the Northern Ireland inquiry lacks the powers to compel evidence or witnesses from government agencies. Amnesty International, which is supporting the victims' legal challenge, says two military intelligence officers have alleged that the security services blocked police investigations into the child abuse at Kincora in the 1970s. The judicial review is expected to last several days. Three senior care staff at Kincora were jailed in 1981 for abusing 11 boys. At least 29 boys were abused at the home between the late 1950s and the early 1980s. One of the men who was later convicted, William McGrath, is believed to have been an MI5 agent.",

        "Mr Ordonez said Gen Palomino would be investigated over the alleged creation of a male prostitution ring. The general is also under investigation for alleged illicit enrichment and conducting illegal wiretaps. Gen Palomino welcomed the probe, which he said he knew would clear his name. \"I hope that the justice system can restore the dignity which has been taken from me through lies and infamy,\" the general said in a statement. The investigation was triggered by allegations by a police captain who said he had been abused by higher-ranking officers during his time as a cadet. Mr Ordonez said that allegation had been backed up by a complaint by a now retired police captain. According to the complaint, young male police cadets were cajoled and threatened into having sex with higher-ranking officers. Mr Ordonez said that according to the testimony gathered by his office, a senator had also allegedly been implicated in the prostitution ring, called \"Community of the Ring.\" He also said that the alleged incidents had taken place \"with the help and complicity of police officials, including the director general [Rodolfo Palomino].\" The wiretapping accusations also relate to the case. Allegedly police officers tapped the phones of journalists investigating the scandal. Gen Palomino has strongly denied any wrongdoing. He has also denied allegations of illicit enrichment and has provided prosecutors with documents which he says show where his money and properties come from. He says the allegations are a political vendetta designed to drive him out of office.",

        "Corey Lewandowski had been charged with simple battery after reporter Michelle Fields said he forcibly grabbed her arm on 8 March. State prosecutors determined there was not enough evidence to convict him. Mr Lewandowski, supported by Mr Trump, accused Ms Fields of exaggerating the event and changing her story. \"Our perception is reality, her perception is that she was almost thrown to the ground,\" said Brad Cohen, Mr Lewandowski's lawyer. Police in Florida had charged Mr Lewandowski after Ms Fields filed a criminal complaint. \"Although there was probable cause to make an arrest, the evidence cannot prove all legally required elements of the crime alleged and is insufficient to support a criminal prosecution,\" prosecutor Dave Aronberg said. The announcement comes days before the New York state primary, which will be crucial to Mr Trump's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr Trump currently leads the race. Investigators did concede that Mr Lewandowski \"pulled Ms Fields back\" when she tried to interview Mr Trump, but said he could have thought she was \"making unwanted physical contact\" with him. \"While the facts support the allegation that Mr. Lewandowski did grab Ms Fields' arm against her will, Mr Lewandowski has a reasonable hypothesis of innocence,\" Mr Aronberg said The Trump campaign said in a statement that Mr Lewandowski is \"gratified\" by the prosecutor's decision. He \"appreciates the thoughtful consideration and professionalism by the Palm Beach State Attorney and his staff who carefully reviewed this matter, as well as Mr. Trump's loyalty and the support of his colleagues and family during this time, the statement reads. \"The matter is now concluded.\" Ms Fields tweeted that the office of the prosecutor asked her if she would accept an apology from Mr Lewandowski, to which she said yes, but that she has not heard back about it. Ms Fields quit her job at conservative news site Breitbart following the event, saying that they did not defend her in the aftermath of the event. Security video released by Mr Trump appears to show him trying to pull Ms Fields out of the way as she walks alongside Mr Trump and tries to speak to him following an event at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. A Washington Post reporter corroborated Ms Fields' claim that Mr Lewandowski forcibly grabbed her and she tweeted a photo of her bruise. Both Mr Trump and Mr Lewandowski accused her of lying, which she repeatedly denied. Mr Trump rejected calls to fire Mr Lewandowski and told him \"good job\" at a press conference shortly after the incident.",
        "Jordan's significance results partly from its strategic location at the crossroads of what Christians, Jews and Muslims call the Holy Land.

        "Probably not - for two sets of reasons. First, the basic facts have not changed - there is no doubt that the situation inside the Labour Party remains dangerously unstable, with probably a majority of Labour MPs deeply uncomfortable with Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. But his is a leadership his party members want, overwhelmingly so. And were a coup to be staged the membership would either re-elect him, or elect someone similar. We're in Bertolt Brecht territory here: the easiest solution for Corbyn-sceptic MPs would be to dissolve the party membership and elect another, as the poet ironically suggested for the Communist regime in 1953. But, failing that, they have to wait for the membership to change its mind. The tactics of any coup attempt revolve around the different views of what might have to occur to trigger such a change. Some think serious electoral reverses in next May's round of elections (the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, the London mayor etc) might do the trick. London could be particularly significant, both as the place where Labour did best at the election in May and as the heartland of the Corbynistas. The argument is that the election of a Tory mayor and a rough ride on the doorstep might re-educate enough of the new wave of Labour members to allow a different leader to be elected. Others argue that it might take two such rounds of May defeats to change enough minds. This, of course, relies on those defeats actually occurring, not to mention them having the effect the anti-Corbyn camp want. We shall see. And it's also worth underlining that the Syria intervention is an issue where Mr Corbyn is in tune with his membership. Then there's the not insignificant question of how a leadership challenge would be triggered. I'm told some Labour MPs have been digging into the archives to study how Hilary's dad, Tony Benn, went about challenging Neil Kinnock, in 1988, and that legal opinions on what Labour's murky and overlapping internal rules might actually mean are being studied in various Westminster offices. One of the key questions is whether Mr Corbyn, if challenged, would need to be nominated by 35 MPs in order to defend his position or whether he would be assured of an automatic position on the ballot papers. Second, there's the climate within the parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). One of the key problems for the coup plotters is identifying an alternative leader, to play Michael Howard to Mr Corbyn's Iain Duncan Smith, and at least keep the Labour show on the road in the 2020 election. Mr Benn has certainly put his head above the parapet - but he's done so on an issue that is highly divisive within the PLP, rather than one of the several causes which pit most Labour MPs against their leader. Take a look at the voting list on Wednesday, where two married couples - Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey and Jenny Chapman and Nick Smith - were split on the issue. In that agonised atmosphere, Mr Benn's moral certainties may not play well in the longer term, whatever their on the day impact. He may have given a masterly Commons performance (a real rarity these days) and made a powerful speech setting out the moral case for military intervention, in terms that had many Tory, as well as Labour, MPs swooning. \"He's clearly running for the leadership - but of which party?\" tittered one SNP MP. But most of Mr Benn's Labour colleagues were conflicted about the issue of whether intervention would work... and I'm not sure the appeal he made to their internationalist roots and to memories of Arthur Greenwood \"speaking for England\" in 1940 will have won over those who doubt both their leader and the case for military action. Certainly there were plenty of MPs from what might be called the \"right\" of the PLP who didn't back the government motion. So it may be worth watching other figures who didn't break cover last night - Rachel Reeves, anyone? All the same, Mr Corbyn's position has been weakened. He was forced to concede a free vote, under the threat of losing much of his shadow cabinet. He was comprehensively outperformed by his shadow foreign secretary and some of his internal critics suspect that competence rather than ideology might be the most corrosive issue for his leadership. This week also saw brutal meetings of the shadow cabinet and the PLP, and, ultimately, a significant chunk of the front bench voting with the government (Hilary Benn, Michael Dugher, Maria Eagle, Angela Eagle, Vernon Coaker, Tom Watson, Lucy Powell, Heidi Alexander, Chris Bryant, Gloria De Piero and Luciana Berger, for the record). And that list included one of his personal left-field picks for high office, the shadow health secretary Ms Alexander. She's proved an effective performer, but I suspect her name is mud in the Corbyn inner circle. Now there will be recriminations and, possibly, attempts at constituency level to deselect the recusants (there does not have to be a return to the'80s era of mandatory reselection; the coming Commons boundary changes will ensure most sitting MPs will not face a simple rubber-stamping to become their party's candidate again). If they succeed, some MPs may quit immediately, forcing uncomfortable by-elections, or simply go rogue in the Commons and vote as they please. We're still some way from further 80s retro developments like an SDP-style breakaway. And defections to the Liberal Democrats seem improbable, both because of the extent of their implosion last May and because a lot of Labour MPs regard the party's new leader, Tim Farron, as \"Corbyn lite.\" So we're left with a destabilised official opposition and no obvious way to resolve its problems that does not involve a major smackdown. Things will get worse in the Labour Party before they get better.

        "Barnsley's Ryan Kent almost caught keeper Chris Maxwell out at the near post with an inswinging corner. Striker Jordan Hugill pulled Preston's best first-half effort just wide from a tight angle from Paul Gallagher's pass. Tom Bradshaw had an effort blocked on the line for Barnsley and Adam Davies clawed away Hugill's header in added time to deny Preston a winner. Barnsley dropped a place to ninth, but only four points behind Sheffield Wednesday in sixth, while Simon Grayson's Preston also slipped one to 11th, three points further back. The home side gave a debut to loan signing Callum Elder at left-back, with Alex Mowatt suspended after being sent off against Wolves, while Preston recalled 6ft 6in Simon Makienok to spearhead their attack. An early header apart, Makienok was well marshalled by Marc Roberts and Angus MacDonald, and was eventually replaced by Jermaine Beckford. Bradshaw was denied by a defender on the line after sliding in to meet Kent's cross, but Davies pushing away Hugill's header as it flew towards the top corner was as close as either side came to breaking the deadlock thereafter in a game of few clear-cut opportunities. Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom: \"I was pleased with how we coped with their threats but I didn't feel that we did enough to win the game. \"There were not enough crosses into the box, not enough efforts on goal. \"I said at half-time I was conscious that I didn't want Preston to grind us down, because the team they picked and the message from Simon (Grayson) at the start of the game was that he wanted a tougher, more aggressive performance. \"I don't even speak about the top six.

        "Since April, convicted criminals in England and Wales have had to pay a charge of between PS150 and PS1,200 towards the cost of their case. MPs on the justice select committee said the charge, which is not means-tested, created \"serious problems\" and was often \"grossly disproportionate.\" Ministers said it was under review. The fee is paid on top of fines, compensation orders and defendants' own legal charges, and is higher for those convicted after pleading not guilty. It is set according to the type of case, with the minimum charge for magistrates' courts and the maximum level for crown court cases. In March, the then Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the fee would ensure that criminals \"pay their way.\" But chairman of the cross-party committee Bob Neill said: \"The evidence we have received has prompted grave misgivings about the operation of the charge, and whether, as currently framed, it is compatible with the principles of justice.\" He added that \"in many cases it is grossly disproportionate\" and created \"perverse incentives - not only for defendants to plead guilty but for sentencers to reduce awards of compensation and prosecution costs.\" The committee's report said the lack of discretion for judges and magistrates on the level of the charge was creating \"unacceptable consequences within the criminal justice system.\" It cited the case of a woman who had admitted stealing a four-pack of Mars Bars worth 75p, saying she \"had not eaten in days\" after her benefits were sanctioned. She was ordered to pay a PS150 criminal courts charge on top of her PS73 fine, PS85 costs, a PS20 victim surcharge and 75p compensation. The committee also said it was \"highly sceptical\" of government claims that the charges could deliver a net revenue of PS80m to PS160m a year by 2023 - with an annual cost of collection of about PS20m and a PS5m bill for imprisoning defaulters. The Ministry of Justice said the concerns were noted and the operation of the fee was being kept under review. It comes after Justice Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament earlier this month that the charge was generating revenue and helping to \"ensure that the taxpayer is not the first port of call for supporting the way in which our courts operate.\" But Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the criminal courts charge was \"unrealistic and unjust\" and called on the Ministry of Justice to \"suspend this policy immediately.\" \"The innocent have been put under pressure to plead guilty, and ordering indigent people to pay money they simply do not have is never going to work,\" she said.",
        "Forensic expert Susan Williamson was giving evidence at the trial of William Burns and Alexander Porter, who deny attacking Russell Findlay. The High Court in Glasgow heard she examined a jacket, mail bag, a knife and a jar that had contained acid. The jury was told DNA matching Mr Burns was found on the jacket. Prosecutor Richard Goddard asked Miss Williamson: \"When you examined the jacket you obtained a DNA profile which matched William Burns,\" and she replied: \"Yes.\" Ms Williamson told the court that she also examined the handle of the knife found at the scene and said the major DNA contributor was Mr Porter. The court was told the odds on the DNA belonging to anyone else not related to the men was a billion to one. Defence counsel Susan Duff, representing Mr Porter, said: \"There are a number of ways DNA could have got there,\" and Ms Williamson said: \"Yes.\" As well as working for the Sun newspaper, Mr Findlay is the author of books about Glasgow crime gangs. Mr Findlay has already given evidence alleging that a man claiming to be a postman came to his door at 08:30 on 23 December 2015. The journalist said the man, whom he identified as Burns, threw liquid onto the right side of his face and right eye. The jury has heard from an eye specialist that Mr Findlay's sight could have been saved by a neighbour dousing is face with water. Mr Burns, 56, and Mr Porter, 48, also deny attempting to murder Ross Sherlock by shooting at him repeatedly near St Helen's Primary School in Bishopbriggs on 24 September 2015.

        "Internet service providers had until Tuesday to implement the ban. The sites now redirect to a message explaining they have been blocked \"by decision of public authorities.\" In 2015, the authorities banned 11 popular pornography websites, saying many failed to protect children \"from information harmful to their health.\" Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites \"spread pornography.\" Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans \"the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects.\" It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them. Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws. Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted. Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative. The agency replied: \"You can meet someone in real life.\" On Tuesday, it said its earlier tweet was \"still relevant.\" However, open rights campaigners have warned that local bans can be defeated. \"Blocking porn is the fastest way to ensure widespread adoption of censorship circumvention in your country,\" said Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. One of the affected porn sites offered Roskomnadzor a premium subscription to its service, in exchange for lifting the ban. The government agency said it was \"not in the market\" for such an offer. Nadya Tolokonnikova, lead singer from punk band Pussy Riot, joked that the ban was \"a blow below the belt.\"",
        "When the nozzle releasing a stream of molten glass is raised above a certain level, that thread begins to wobble. It traces out waves or loops - which the team found could be controlled by adjusting the speed of the nozzle. Those shapes then become the building blocks for intricate, 3D objects. Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology pioneered a method for glass 3D printing in 2015. They then started to work with mathematician Pierre-Thomas Brun, who has studied the fluid dynamics of liquid \"ropes.\" The results are documented in a video, which the team presented in the American Physical Society's \"Gallery of Fluid Motion\" in November. It all started with a collaboration between two labs at MIT, Dr Brun told the BBC - one specialising in glass and the other in \"mediated matter.\" Runny honey \"Normally when you 3D print, the nozzle is very close to the piece that you're printing - that's the conventional method. But what they started working with was having a large offset. \"And in that case, instead of having a thread that falls down and moves straight, you can create coil-like patterns like honey on toast.\" That coiling process, as it happens, is exactly what Dr Brun studied during his PhD. \"I came up with a reduced model that explained the dynamics of these things,\" he said. \"So I have a way to rationalise the patterns they observed, and we started working together in order to create some structures that take those patterns as building blocks.\" Suddenly, instead of being a potential flaw in the system, the wobbling of the liquid glass became a tunable design feature. And what is more, some of the tiny loops are smaller than anything that could be created by moving the nozzle itself around. The physics of the dribbling glass itself was now a precision instrument. What most impressed Dr Brun was how simple it was to control that instrument. For a given nozzle height, he explained, everything boils down to how fast the glass is being poured, relative to how fast the nozzle is moving forward. \"These coils may seem complex, but you can rationalise them in a very simple way. And to do that you need one number: how fast is the glass falling onto the surface?\" If the dribbling of the glass starts to outstrip the forward progress of the nozzle, the thread will trace out a meandering, wavy line instead of a straight one. Then if the forward motion gets even slower, the glass will start to trace small, alternating loops. Even slower, and the loops become one big coil. It was a surprise, Dr Brun said, that this simple ratio produced such a variety of shapes. \"This is a very complex system, but you can forget about all the other properties. That's a big statement, which has no reason to be true - but it is, in this case.\" Following the lead of other researchers, studying the dynamics of viscous liquid threads nearly 10 years ago, Dr Brun and his colleagues called their system a \"sewing machine.\" \"It does exactly what a sewing machine does,\" he observed. \"You go from a thread, to patterns which are tied to each other like stitching patterns - but this time they're made out of glass.\" Many of his collaborators at MIT are interested in potential applications for architecture, and the design may also prove useful in sculpture and in 3D printing - or \"additive manufacturing\" - more widely. \"There are many possibilities, but for now this is just a proof of concept,\" Dr Brun said.

        "The company, best known for its smartphone chips, wants to reduce spending by 1.4bn (PS900m), partly through a 15 cut in its workforce. The US-based firm also delivered its third profit warning of the year. Qualcomm had been under pressure from major shareholders to make changes in light of rising competition from Asia. The cost-cutting efforts announced on Wednesday will include culling around 4,500 full-time jobs. Qualcomm also said it may break itself up. Shareholder Jana Partners had been pressuring the firm to separate the chip business from the more profitable patent-licensing business. The company makes chips used in smartphones and tablets, especially the Snapdragon processor found in many mid- and high-end Android devices. But it has faced increasing competition from Asian manufacturers like Taiwan's MediaTek or smaller Chinese chipmakers. Smartphone giant Samsung plans to increasingly use its own processors for its future devices rather than going for the Snapdragon chip. Qualcomm shares fell more than 20 over the past year and dropped further in Wednesday's after hour trading. In a weak revenue forecast, the company had to give its third profit warning of the year. For the past quarter, the company said its net income fell by 47 with revenue down by 14, both numbers coming in below expectations.",
        "The next public consultation in the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) scheme was due in September but may not be published until summer 2018. Regional mayor Andy Burnham promised to revise the plans following protests from affected communities. The revised plans will be announced \"in due course,\" the mayor's office said. The GMSF scheme identifies sites for housing developments that may be built over the next 20 years. The area's combined authority, which brings together 10 councils, published a joint plan last October to allocate land for development. Due to the scale of development required to meet expected population growth, it outlined plans to make swathes of protected greenbelt land available for new homes. The authority received more than 25,000 responses to the consultation while community groups protested against the plans. Mr Burnham, who was elected as metropolitan mayor in May, promised to \"radically re-write\" the plans, calling them \"unfair and disproportionate.\" The BBC understands council leaders are not expecting the next consultation to take place until next year due to the work involved. Matthew Collinge from the Save our Slattocks group, which is opposed to homes being built on greenbelt land between Middleton and Royton, said the delay was \"disappointing.\" He said: \"It stretches out the fear of the unknown and us. It's very easy for people to lose interest and we've been working towards this September deadline. \"We now have to keep people aware of what's happening for longer and that makes it harder for a small community group like ours.\" Matthew Good, a spokesman for the House Builder's Federation said: \"It's important for everybody that we have some certainty on this. \"Councils need to invest in infrastructure. They need to know where those developments are going to happen. \"Without a plan it's going to be a lot more piecemeal because investors will have to take chances on where they can get development and the councils may not be in control of that.\" A spokesman for Mr Burnham said the mayor had appointed Salford City Mayor Paul Dennett to lead a \"radical\" rewrite of the plans. He added: \"This re-write is currently underway and details on the next round of consultation will be announced in due course.\"",

Not by international terrorists, not by enemy troops. This time it's Washington's chief delivering the slap in the face, ramping up the workload for the incoming team...\" Zakharova says Jews backed Trump \"Such actions of the administration in Washington are the demonstration, unfortunately, of an unpredictable, even aggressive, I can say, foreign policy. We think that such decisions of the acting administration, which is supposed to be in office for three more weeks, pursue two aims: finally (irrevocably?) spoiling US-Russian relations and, obviously, having an impact on the foreign policy of the future administration of the president-elect [Donald Trump].\" \"What these individuals were doing were basically collecting intelligence. They were intelligence officers operating here and using these compounds, one in New York, one in Maryland, for intelligence collection purposes. And what we are saying today is, in response to and in order to impose consequences for the Russian government's increasing harassment and aggression toward our personnel in Moscow, and, of course, their malicious cyber-activities, interfering and an effort to interfere in our election process, we are imposing consequences.\" \"They [the Russians] are trying to destabilize democracy all over the world, not just here.

        "Hamilton survived a scare at the start, when he ran wide at the first corner after locking a front tyre. But otherwise he was untroubled en route to his 51st career win. In the championship, the result changes little, and Rosberg can win the title by finishing second to Hamilton at the last two races of the season. Hamilton is 19 points adrift with a total of 50 available in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Rosberg can now regroup after a weekend on which Hamilton was in almost total control throughout. The German will doubtless keep to his well-worn mantra that he is taking it one race at a time and trying to win each one, but he has the luxury of knowing he can afford to take it easy in both remaining races and clinch his first world title. Rosberg also had a scare, and a more eventful race than Hamilton, as 120,000 fans had little to excite them under blue skies and warm sunshine in Mexico City, until some frantic and bad-tempered late action in a battle over third place between Red Bull's Max Verstappen, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. Hamilton spent the first stint controlling his pace to ensure he did not overwork his damaged tyre, while Rosberg was under pressure from Verstappen. Rosberg and the Dutchman had collided at the first corner as Verstappen tried to take second place, Rosberg taking to the grass behind Hamilton after the collision. The incident was investigated by the stewards but given the all-clear. It was a foretaste of what was to come. As Hamilton controlled the race - on the way to a victory that puts him equal with Alain Prost in second place in the all-time winners' list, with Michael Schumacher way ahead on 91 - Rosberg spent much of the afternoon watching his mirrors for Verstappen. There was stalemate for a long time, until Rosberg locked up into Turn One on lap 50 while trying to lap Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz. Verstappen saw his opportunity and dived down the inside into Turn Four. Although he was briefly ahead, he could not stop in time and ran wide, sliding across the track on opposite steering lock, and Rosberg regained the place. It was Verstappen's one and only chance. Once he was back up to speed, the gap was out to 2.5 seconds and Rosberg edged gently away for the rest of the race. Red Bull's gamble of starting on the super-soft tyres to try to mix it with the Mercedes did not really pay off, but it led to a dramatic battle in the closing laps. Instead of challenging Rosberg, Verstappen found himself under pressure in the closing laps from Vettel and Ricciardo. Vettel started on the soft tyre like the Mercedes and ran a very long 33-lap first stint, leading for 16 laps after Hamilton's first stop. That gave him tyres that were 20 laps fresher than Verstappen's for the final stint and he closed in inexorably until he was within 1.2secs with six laps to go. Verstappen locked up at the first corner on lap 68 and ran wide over the grass, cutting the corner and keeping hold of third place, the German complaining he should be given the position as Verstappen was advised by his team to hand it over. But Verstappen kept fighting as Vettel tried to pass, the four-time world champion claiming the Dutchman was backing him into Ricciardo, who fought back through the field after a first-lap stop put him on a two-stop strategy. The three were nose to tail at the start of the penultimate lap and Vettel was right on the edge in holding Ricciardo back as he tried to pass into Turn Four. The incident spread the gap between the three cars and Verstappen crossed the line in third, from Vettel and Ricciardo. But Verstappen's cutting of the first corner was investigated by the stewards on the grounds he might have gained an advantage by leaving the track and in dramatic scenes Verstappen was given a five-second penalty immediately after the race and was demoted to fifth. Verstappen was forced to leave the pre-podium room as Vettel ran to take up his place on the podium. However, in a further twist, Vettel then lost third place after becoming the first driver to be punished under a new dangerous driving rule for his defence against Ricciardo's attempted pass. Vettel was penalised 10 seconds for moving while in the braking zone and given two penalty points on his licence - ending up fifth and Ricciardo eventually being classified as third. Vettel had earlier fumed over the radio, using several expletives in telling his team how unhappy he was with race director Charlie Whiting. He and Verstappen then gesticulated at each other after crossing the line, Vettel wagging his finger at Verstappen. Lewis Hamilton: \"This is honestly the best crowd we get anywhere. In our home country it is always great, but these guys have such a great passion. \"I love it here. I have had tacos every night. Media playback is not supported on this device \"Nico is doing a great job.

I was really disappointed when I crossed the line.\" Mexican Grand Prix race results Mexican Grand Prix coverage details",

But Luke Cowan-Dickie's try just before the break kept the Chiefs in touch. Olly Woodburn and Don Armand crossed after half-time to earn a bonus point and keep Exeter second in the table. Rob Baxter's side are now level on points with leaders Wasps, who play Worcester Warriors on Sunday, while reigning champions Saracens in third host fifth-placed Bath. Exeter's victory over Sale Sharks, however, was far from straightforward in blustery conditions in Devon. Playing with their wind at their backs in the first half, the Sharks were good value for their lead, with MacGinty reliable from the tee and wing Solomona's ninth try in eight Premiership games putting them ahead. But Exeter, who had England wing Jack Nowell back from Six Nations duty, scored two tries during the first 40 minutes to keep them in contention. And, with conditions on their side after half-time, they managed two further scores to wrap up a bonus-point victory and ensure they bounced back from last week's Anglo-Welsh Cup final defeat by Leicester Tigers. Exeter Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter: \"I can't be happy at us playing at that level and we need to shake ourselves up for the remainder the season. \"We were disrupted in the first half and threw careless passes, which made it difficult for ourselves - and had we not scored just before interval the mountain may have been too high to climb. \"This was a real wake-up call for us as Sale have worried us in the past and we weren't ready for them.\" Sale Sharks director of rugby Steve Diamond: \"I'm disappointed we didn't win the game but I'm satisfied with the bonus point as we had a blip against Northampton in our last league game, when we didn't turn up. \"Exeter are a good side and the try we conceded just before half-time was probably crucial, but we made a couple of basic errors at vital times. \"I'm pleased we stopped them playing, as they thought they could just kick to the corners and score but our line-out defence was very good and I'm happy that we had them thinking outside the box.\" Exeter: Dollman; Nowell, Whitten, Devoto, Woodburn; Slade, Townsend; Moon, Cowan-Dickie, Williams, Lees, Parling, Horstmann, Armand (capt), Waldrom.

        "His comments come amid the expenses scandal that has embroiled the government for the past three weeks. Mr Abbott said on Friday the woman at the centre of the scandal, Speaker of the House of Representatives Bronwyn Bishop, was \"deeply remorseful\" about her use of taxpayers' funds to travel to friends' weddings and Liberal party functions. The prime minister has himself had to pay back money spent on travel in the past. The scandal began when it became public that Ms Bishop had spent A5,000 (3,647; PS2,339) of public funds on a helicopter flight to a Liberal Party function that could have easily been reached by road. She has also claimed expenses for travel to several weddings of her Liberal Party colleagues. Australia's rules about travel entitlements for politicians are hazy but Ms Bishop's spending set social media on fire and she soon became the speaker who sparked a thousand memes. The Facebook page Bronwyn Bishop Memes gained more than 13,000 followers in just a week, as users poked fun at her chopper ride. Memes have adopted the helicopter as their main tool to mock the speaker, with Ms Bishop using chopper flights for everything from taking extreme holidays and dropping the kids at the local swimming pool to going for a jog - via chopper. The public have also had fun at her expense with cultural references ranging from Australian TV soap operas to movies such as 101 Dalmatians and Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. Social media taunts even included sly hints towards other expenses scandals, such as the misuse of living away from home allowances for politicians. Ms Bishop has apologised and is paying back the helicopter costs but she is resisting calls, from independent senators and reportedly even from some members of the government, to resign. \"I love this country very much and it does sadden me that I have let [the public] down,\" Ms Bishop told reporters. \"I won't resign from the position but I will be working very hard,\" she said.",
        "Mr Schmidt told the BBC that the company did what was \"legally required\" to pay the right amount of taxes. Google paid PS10m in UK corporate taxes between 2006 and 2011. Mr Schmidt said it was up to the government to change its tax system if it wanted companies to pay more taxes. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week, he said: \"What we are doing is legal. I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for some time, because I view taxes as not optional. \"I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required. It's not a debate. You pay the taxes. \"If the British system changes the tax laws, then we will comply. If the taxes go up, we will pay more, if they go down, we will pay less. That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom.\" Meanwhile, the head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, has suggested a new committee should be established to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms. She told the Independent newspaper that such a committee could hear evidence from companies in secret, meaning that companies would not be able to hide their tax affairs behind confidentiality rules. Google, most of whose UK sales are routed through Ireland, is one of the multinationals strongly criticised for organising their tax affairs in ways that minimise the amounts they pay in the UK. Last week, European Union leaders agreed to tackle tax avoidance through an \"automatic information exchange between tax authorities\" to monitor the situation. The Google chairman has previously argued that corporate taxes should be levied in the country where it conducts economic activity and takes risks, rather than where products are consumed. He has also called for a debate on international tax reform. \"Politicians - not companies - [should] set the rules...When legislators are doing the lobbying and companies are articulating the law as it stands, it's a confusing spectacle for everyone,\" he recently wrote in the Observer. \"Our hope is to move the debate forward, with everyone engaged constructively in developing a clearer, simpler system - one in which companies that abide by the law know that the politicians who devised the rules are willing to defend and commend them.\"",
        "The Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry is examining allegations of abuse in state-run children's homes and other institutions in Northern Ireland. However, victims of clerical child abuse and former residents of Magdalene laundry-style institutions in Northern Ireland are excluded from the remit. They have launched a joint campaign. The two groups were due to call for the remit of the Historic Institutional Abuse Inquiry to be widened. The inquiry, chaired by retired judge Sir Anthony Hart, was set up by the Stormont Executive and is examining cases from 1922 to 1995. It will also determine if there were systemic failings by the state, or institutions, in their duties towards children under 18. It was originally set up to investigate cases going back as far as 1945, but it was later extended to cover the period back to the foundation of the state in 1922. Previously, Sir Anthony has opposed further extending the scope of his inquiry to deal with abuse which took place outside institutions. He pointed out that such a move would have significant implications in terms of time and money. The inquiry is currently investigating 35 residential facilities. They include 15 state-run children's homes, 13 institutions run by Catholic Church orders and four borstals or training schools. The inquiry was announced in December 2010 and the first phase began in October 2012. Three institutions run by Protestant churches or voluntary organisations will also be investigated.",
        "At the Election Court - part of the High Court - in London, four voters alleged mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman had committed electoral fraud. Independent Mr Rahman was elected for a second term in May 2014. His lawyer said the claims were a \"mixture of unfounded and false allegations.\" The group of voters wants the poll declared void and rerun. Evidence is to be outlined to Election Commissioner Richard Mawrey - a senior lawyer sitting as a judge - over a number of weeks. The group of voters mounted the challenge under the provisions of the 1983 Representation Of The People Act. Andy Erlam, who stood as a councillor on an anti-corruption ticket and is heading the group, said there were \"serious questions\" which \"need answers.\" Francis Hoar, representing the group of four, told Mr Mawrey his clients were accusing Mr Rahman of election fraud. He said there had been \"personation\" - where people pretend to be someone else to cast a vote - in postal voting and at polling stations. He added people had registered themselves or others to vote at addresses at which they did not live and there had been tampering with ballot papers. Mr Hoar also alleged Mr Rahman had used \"undue influence through intimidation at polling stations\" and \"interference with voters\" - including in polling booths. The court heard one presiding officer reported there was a \"constant battle\" to stop men entering polling booths with women and telling them how to vote. He said there had been \"bribery\" through \"unlawfully diverting public funds to organisations in order corruptly to procure their political support.\" Mr Hoar told Mr Mawrey that his clients aimed to call almost 100 witnesses who \"know about corruption\" and \"know about Lutfur Rahman.\" Mr Mawrey told the court that, if he found allegations had been proved, he could declare the election \"void\" and rule that Mr Rahman had not been declared mayor. Allegations against returning officer John Williams have been withdrawn by lawyers for the group, the court was told. Timothy Straker QC, for Mr Williams, said it had been accepted his client had \"acted properly throughout the election.\" Mr Williams said, outside court, in a statement: \"This was a hotly contested election run in challenging circumstances. \"As returning officer I am politically neutral and my only concern is to run an efficient, free and fair election.\" Duncan Penny QC, for Mr Rahman, described the petition as \"a rich and elaborate mixture of unfounded and false allegations\" and its one aim was to unseat a directly elected mayor. He told the court: \"There is little, if any evidence, of personal wrongdoing by Lutfur Rahman\" and described the group's claims as \"invention\" and \"exaggeration.\" He said Mr Rahman did not want to be elected as a result of fraudulent activity and had been anxious that electoral law was observed. Mr Penny said: \"He has consistently called for anyone with suspicion of malpractice to report them and has been a public proponent of reforms to the postal voting system.\" The hearing continues.",

Antoinette Sandbach accused Mr Graham of \"not willing to put his vote where his principles allegedly are.\" Group leader Andrew RT Davies said the online row would \"not be repeated.\" Mr Graham backed a Conservative motion in the Senedd in January calling for a review of the possible routes for an M4 relief road. But following the debate he tweeted: \"I am confident that when the public inquiry is held the'black route' will be chosen,\" referring to the Welsh government's preferred option. Some critics have claimed other routes would cause less environmental damage. It prompted responses from two of Mr Graham's colleagues asking whether he supported or disagreed with Conservative policy to review the alternatives. Group leader Andrew RT Davies told journalists on Tuesday he had \"spoken to\" each of the members who were \"all signed up to the group position.\" \"If people want to go on to Twitter to have a tittle-tattle that's neither here nor there,\" he said. \"The people involved know my views on it and I'm confident it won't be repeated.\"",
        "Hampshire, who chose to bowl, had Essex 0-1 when Nick Browne was caught off the bowling of Fidel Edwards. Rain then caused a lengthy delay, but Cook (114 not out) and Westley (111) dominated when play resumed. Kyle Abbott finally ended their stand, bowling Westley with the last ball of the day as Essex closed on 243-2. England opener Cook's ton was his second of the season, with the former Test captain averaging 81.75 with the bat through five first-class innings this season. He was ably supported by Westley, whose century was his first of the season in first-class cricket. Hampshire could take few positives from a difficult first day, especially after a shoulder injury to fast bowler Edwards, but Abbott's late removal of Westley will leave them with some hope of limiting the hosts' score. Essex batsman Tom Westley: \"It's good to get that first score out of the way. That first Championship hundred of the season is always nice. It was tough going, but it's pleasing to get some runs. What's most pleasing is the position we're in after being put in to bat. \"We would have wanted to bowl first in those conditions. It did nip around in the first hour and a half. It's a good cricketing wicket, but there is definitely a bit in it for the bowlers, but also if they miss their length you feel you score. \"I don't think Cookie will mind me saying we both played and missed. On another day you can nick them and we can be 100 for three or four. But sometimes you have to ride the luck and Cookie's was a chanceless hundred. They bowled well at him, so it wasn't easy going. It's great having him at the other end. He just loves scoring runs. He's a huge asset for the club.\" Hampshire coach Craig White: \"We'll assess Fidel Edwards' injury in the morning, but it looks a bit sore and he'll struggle to take a further part in the game. \"Every game it seems this year we've had a bowler go down. It's not ideal, it's just frustrating. Injuries happen I know but when it happens every game and you're a bowler down you wonder if you're doing something wrong.\" \"It was a frustrating day. At the start we wouldn't have thought they'd only be two wickets down at the end of play. I'm a little bit shocked really. It was great conditions to bowl in and we probably early on didn't get enough balls consistently in the right areas. But you have to take your hat off to those two. They played really well.\"",

Holly Nixon, Joel Cassells and Rebecca Shorten have all moved straight into Sunday's finals of their respective boat classes. Chambers and Fletcher began the quest for a lightweight double sculls European title fresh from their gold medal winning performance in the first World Cup regatta in Belgrade earlier this month. However they were forced to qualify for Saturday's semi-finals through the repechage after finishing behind Germany in their heat with only the winners progressing directly. The duo regrouped and in the afternoon session held off the fast finishing Greek boat to take first place. Ireland's Rio Olympics silver medal winning brothers, Gary and Paul O'Donovan, who are defending their European title won in Brandenburg twelve months ago, had to follow the same path as Chambers and Fletcher. They were beaten by Poland in their heat but won their repechage ahead of Ukraine. Enniskillen's Holly Nixon and her team mates Jess Leyden, Bethany Bryan and Mathilda Hodgkins-Byrne moved up from fourth place to second behind the Netherlands to claim an automatic qualifying place in Sunday's women's quadruple sculls final.

        "Glamorgan built their innings on a 122-run second-wicket stand between Will Bragg (75) and Jacques Rudolph (53). After Graham Wagg's 49, the hosts were bowled out in the final over for 289. Chasing 290 to win, the visitors were eventually restricted to 237 all out, despite Michael Klinger's 52 and some late stroke play from Benny Howell (77). Bragg's aggressive 75 off 68 balls got the scoreboard moving well, while Rudolph's cautious 53 was his first half-century of the season. Matt Taylor, Liam Norwell and Howell all bowled intelligently to restrict Glamorgan's acceleration in the latter stages. But the target of 290 looked a long way off when Wagg claimed two early wickets and part-time spinner Colin Ingram took two cheap ones in the middle of the innings, including the vital one of Klinger. Howell's hitting took the game into the closing overs to make it a fine personal performance, before becoming Timm van der Gugten's third wicket. Glamorgan now face Sussex in Cardiff on Wednesday, while Gloucestershire host Middlesex on the same day, still looking for their first win. The One-Day Cup holders lost their opening game by one wicket to Somerset on Sunday when the home side's last pair Jamie Overton and Tim Groenewald put on an unlikely 65 to win with three balls to spare. Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport: \"We were quite clinical in the way we went about our business. William Bragg batted outstandingly but we were 15-20 runs short of where we could have been. \"I just wanted to spend some time in the middle. That's important when you're not performing as well as you'd like and I was fortunate to bat with Braggy who's in very good touch. \"Our bowlers were very good. Colin Ingram bowled exceptionally, as well as Timm van der Gugten. At the moment we've got some good momentum in white-ball cricket. If that can continue for the rest of the week I'll be a happy captain.\" Gloucestershire captain Michael Klinger told BBC Radio Bristol: \"Last year we won seven out of eight. There's no reason why we can't win five out of six now but we need to do the little things a bit better, particularly in the field. \"We got out-worked because they out-fielded us and bowled really well to their field. \"It's tough not having Jack Taylor to bowl.

It said the refugees - who happened to be passing at the time - had left by the time police arrived. NPD members have taken part in a series of anti-immigrant marches in Germany. However, regional NPD official Jean Christoph Fiedler praised the two refugees for \"a very good, humane act,\" the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper reported. Germany's constitutional court is currently considering whether to ban the NPD. The federal upper house (Bundesrat) of the parliament took the case to the court, by arguing in a petition that the party is racist and anti-Semitic, and poses a threat to Germany's democratic order. A previous attempt to ban the NPD failed in 2003 because the judges dismissed evidence provided by state agents who had infiltrated the party.

It's about being in the mix, and you can't ask any more of ourselves to both get hundreds,\" said Donald. \"We accept this year there's going to be more competition for places which is a great thing for the club, pushing us as batters and bowlers.\" Donald could still beat Matthew Maynard's record for the youngest Championship century, achieved in 1985.

        "But the overall national picture for GCSE grades is very similar to last year. The proportion getting A to C grades has nudged up from 68.8 to 69. That represents an improvement for more than 10,000 exam entries. But the overall message - and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top A and A grades - is that there is \"stability.\" This isn't an accident. The annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate. It's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be. Well, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature. The huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands. There has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils. Add to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards. Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results. He has warned of \"volatility,\" with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective. \"It is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,\" said Mr Lightman. The lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit? Are there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades? Ofqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system. But it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems. Once there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year. Now there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same. Another factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam. This year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort. There are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the GCSEs early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt. And another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on GCSE maths and English last year are having to re-sit the exam this year. This means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds. But if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Northern Ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7 to 78.7. It raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66 make the grade in Wales. Not only is the Northern Ireland figure far ahead of England, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of England, which was London with 72. England's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is Northern Ireland that is stretching further ahead. When these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in Northern Ireland are doing much better than anyone else. The scores from the GCSE top grades show the gap. Among entries from female pupils in Northern Ireland, 11.4 achieve A grades. Among male pupils in Wales, the figure is 4.5. In England, 5.2 of entries from male pupils and 7.9 of female achieve these highest A grades. This sets a pattern for A-levels and university entry, with Northern Irish women the most likely in the UK to get university places. Whether or not it is going to be consolation for England's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible. Because in a couple of years England's GCSEs will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than A to G, ending a common system with Wales and Northern Ireland. Another curious aside is that many of the pupils taking GCSEs this year in England did not take their Sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott. What difference did it make in the long term? It would take another exam to answer that one.",

        "The new College of Policing guidance is designed to help officers prosecute without relying on victims' evidence. It also advises senior officers about the need for specialist staff to deal with cases of abuse and ensure victims receive the best possible support. David Tucker, from the college, said a change was needed within policing in attitudes towards domestic abuse. The College of Policing guidance focuses on abusive relationship dynamics. A new domestic abuse offence of \"coercive and controlling behaviour\" within relationships is expected to come into force later this year, after it was unveiled by Home Secretary Theresa May last year. This type of behaviour can include the abuser preventing their victim from having friendships or hobbies, refusing them access to money and determining many aspects of their everyday life. The college is releasing a \"toolkit\" for officers who are first at the scene of an incident, as well as checklists for call handlers and counter staff in police stations for when they are contacted about domestic abuse. Mr Tucker, head of the college's crime and criminal justice faculty, said: \"Our research indicated the need for a culture change within policing attitudes towards domestic abuse. \"Sometimes police cannot understand why a victim would stay in an abusive relationship. \"There are dozens of reasons why victims feel unable to leave or support prosecution. \"It is the responsibility of the perpetrator to stop the abuse and the responsibility of the police to bring the perpetrator to justice - the victim is not responsible for either.\" He said police needed to investigate domestic abuse \"pro-actively\" and should be \"properly trained.\" Polly Neale, chief executive of the charity Women's Aid, said it was \"vital\" that police officers understood coercive control to help them identify victims. Diana Barran, from the charity SafeLives, said the new guidance was \"a huge step forward in helping police to understand the complex nature of domestic abuse and - in particular - coercive control.\"",

        "But his killing in an air strike is a grievous strategic error - militarily insignificant but diplomatically disastrous. Towards the end of April, Nato states made a number of operational innovations. Three member states - Britain, France, and Italy - injected military advisers into rebel-held eastern Libya. Another, the US, began continuous patrols of armed drones. Third, and most important, air strikes began to target command, control, communications and intelligence networks (known, in military parlance, as C3I). The Bab al-Aziziya compound includes all three such networks, and it was presumed that their disruption would disorient regime soldiers on the front line, cut off field commanders from Tripoli, and sow confusion in the ranks. But was the strike also an assassination attempt? Assassination of a head of state is illegal under international law, and forbidden by various US presidential orders. On the other hand, the targeted killing of those woven into the enemy chain of command is shrouded in legal ambiguity. Given the personalistic nature of the regime, and the \"all means necessary\" clause in UN Resolution 1973, it might be argued that killing Col Muammar Gaddafi and certain members of his family - such as his son Khamis, commander of an elite military brigade - would be permissible, even if it posed a risk to those non-combatants around the regime. Legality, though, indicates neither legitimacy nor prudence. This strike, and the death of Saif al-Arab, have produced little military result at the greatest diplomatic and symbolic cost to Nato. Saif al-Arab was, unlike his brothers, not a senior military commander or propagandist. His death is redolent of the 1986 US strike on the same compound. That raid killed a girl who Col Gaddafi later claimed was his adopted daughter and, in the scarred buildings and craters, furnished him with a long-lasting symbol of defiance. The propaganda value of such unintended deaths is potentially severe. In the 1991 Gulf War, a US stealth bomber directed two bombs at what was claimed to be a command-and-control bunker, but was in fact an Iraqi civilian shelter. The result was 315 deaths, including 130 children. Col Gaddafi, like Saddam Hussein before him, will take every opportunity to exploit such errors to paint Western powers as indiscriminate aggressors. Moreover, this is no longer a conventional war in which top-down direction is crucial. Pro-Gaddafi forces in both the besieged western city of Misrata and in the east have adapted to Nato's air power and are using increasingly unorthodox tactics. They need not rely on a stream of detailed orders from Tripoli, and can cause considerable harm to civilians without this guidance. Nato is understandably frustrated at the diminishing returns of air strikes, since it has destroyed most accessible targets. But killing commanders and disrupting communications is far less important than the key task of degrading heavy military equipment, such as tanks and artillery. If the strike had killed Col Gaddafi himself, would it then have been at least a military success? One of the greatest mistakes of the Iraq war was assuming that, with the departure of Saddam Hussein, the state apparatus could simply be transferred to new ownership. Col Gaddafi's death could see Saif al-Islam Gaddafi take the reins, galvanise supporters, and continue the war with equal intensity. It would be dangerous and short-sighted to portray even effective assassination as a silver bullet. Perhaps, though, the demonstration to the regime that no safe haven exists, and that only capitulation would bring security, justified these risks? There is no doubt that, along with the military aim of disrupting command-and-control hubs, Nato sought a psychological effect, conscious of the possibility of \"accidental assassination.\" The problem is that the direction of this effect is unclear. The dramatic visual impact of this air strike, and the death of those disconnected from political and military leadership, will harden the diplomatic opposition to the war, from Russia and China amongst others. More consequentially, it will anger the alliance's warier members, like Germany and Turkey, and inflame parts of Arab and African public opinion. It may eventually leave Britain and France bearing the military burden alone, with modest but limited assistance from a cagey US administration eager to keep at arm's length from this European war. Col Gaddafi's overarching strategy has never been to win a conventional war, but to induce symbolically prominent casualties, drive a wedge between more committed and more ambivalent members of the coalition, and knock away the pillars of political support on which this intervention was built. Thus far, the coalition had sought, rightly, to purchase coalition longevity at the price of campaign intensity. If that balance continues to shift towards the latter, Nato runs the risk of playing into the regime's hands.

        "BBC correspondents from around the UK reflect on how people have been voting and the implications at a local level. The north of England has roared back at London - this result underlines the disconnect between the capital and the outlying parts of England, writes Danny Savage. It showed in the results - London overwhelmingly In, huge parts of the north Out. For many this wasn't just about Europe, it was about a metropolitan elite telling them what to do. And then rebelling against it. Throughout the campaign nearly everyone I talked to across this vast area was Out. A sunny day at Cartmel races in May saw people sporting'vote leave' badges. \"This is a north versus south vote,\" one race-goer told me. A day in Goole saw elderly women confiding that they didn't recognise their town any more and couldn't understand the language people in it spoke. One prominent poll got it wrong last night - calling a Remain victory. That was soon shaken by a Remain win in Newcastle but one which was not as large as predicted. The rest is history. What may be the case is that some people voted against the establishment rather than the EU. As was said during the campaign, the Remain argument was accused of being \"too much Hampstead, not enough Hull.\" In Scotland the biggest and most pressing question is whether this vote could spell the break-up of the UK and hasten the day we see an independent Scotland, writes Scotland editor Sarah Smith. Every region in Scotland voted to remain but the UK-wide result means that Scotland will nonetheless be leaving the EU. This is exactly the scenario SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon envisaged when she said that if Scotland is \"dragged out of the EU against its will,\" that could trigger a second referendum on Scottish independence. Already, her predecessor as SNP leader Alex Salmond is saying that Ms Sturgeon will now call for a second referendum - indyref 2, as it is known in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said a second referendum was \"highly likely\" on Friday. It was the biggest single voting district in the UK - around 700,000 registered voters - and one of the closest results of the night, writes Nick Higham. Birmingham voted Leave by just 3,800 votes. In its West Midlands hinterland the vote was much clearer. In manufacturing districts like Coventry they ignored the dire warnings from big business that a leave vote would hit the economy. And some of the poorest areas voted by the largest margin to quit: 68 to 32 in Dudley. In Birmingham itself the mood of commuters on their way to work ranged from exultation to disbelief. \"We're strong enough and brave enough and confident enough to get out there and show the world what we're really made of,\" said Lisa, who works in banking. \"We've got our democracy back and we can build an absolutely brilliant future for ourselves,\" said a smartly-dressed man who did not want to give his name. \"It's going to be democracy not bureaucracy.\" Area-by-area in maps: See how people voted But Sam, who works in recruitment, said the decision would have a big impact in his job, and called it a big mistake: \"We're going to go into a big recession.\" \"It's absolutely ridiculous,\" said a civil servant. \"I cannot believe we've gone out. I'm an entrenched European, my girlfriend's German, my car is German, it's ridiculous.\" The vote divided families. One woman told me she'd \"followed her heart\" and voted to leave, but her partner had voted to remain because they had a property in Europe. And some had opted out altogether. Madeleine, a policy officer, said: \"I didn't want to be accountable for my actions if I made the wrong decision.\" So what did she think of the outcome? \"A good result for maybe ten years time, maybe not so good for now.\" As the crystal dawn breaks over the green patchwork landscape of the South West, farmers are already starting their working day when the referendum result is declared, writes Claire Marshall. On one farm in rural Wiltshire the view from the milking shed is one of surprise - but satisfaction: the future is to be trading \"with the world\" not \"a little club.\" There is frustration with labyrinthine regulations and subsidies that support inefficient farms, calcifying the industry \"in the hands of the older generation.\" So, content, they get on with their job of providing the milk we put in our cups of tea and over which we mull the new landscape. Fiona Trott writes: In a town where seven out of 10 people backed Brexit, one man I spoke to in Hartlepool summed up the general mood: \"It's been a vote against the establishment.\" Unemployment here is 9.4. People feel hard done by. When you stop and talk to voters in the street, they tell you things couldn't get any worse, so why not vote for change? It's probably why UKIP gained three seats here in the May elections. People here feel like they want to take back control. What about the financial markets? One shopper told me:\"It's just a blip.\" \"Time for a party,\" \"it's a good day\" and \"we've got our country back\" - just some of the voices in Burnley, writes Ed Thomas. Voters in this east Lancashire market town sent a loud and clear message - they overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU by a majority of two to one. Outside the local butchers we find Eric and his wife Lucy, both in their 70s and both in a celebratory mood. Eric shouts \"we are free of the idiots over there.\" He also says this means the \"French will stop sending them (migrants) over the Channel.\" Lucy, when asked, says she hates the EU and is glad to \"have the power back.\" It is, she says, a \"happy day.\" For those voting \"Out\" there is a sense of achievement, that for the first time in a long time their voices have been listened to. Burnley has been shaped by immigration and is home to some of the most deprived areas in the UK. In a local hair salon, just yards from a Romanian busker, we speak to Michael and Stacey. They say \"power is back with us\" and suggest that the voices of doom \"are scaremongering.\" But not everyone is celebrating - here we also find 16-year-old Molly with her mother, Liz. Both are worried - Molly doesn't know what her future holds and wishes the vote was to remain. And what about the economy, asks Liz - \"the pound's dropping, the euro is dropping.\" After a long pause, she says: \"I woke up today and I'm just sad.\" The news that David Cameron is stepping down has sent a shockwave through his Witney constituency, writes Bethan Philips. He has a lot of loyal supporters here. He isn't a distant figure in Westminster - he is someone that campaigns here, gets involved in local issues, and during election time, goes door-to-door to gain support. I was with one local Conservative activist as the news broke - he was visibly shaking with shock. The big question now for Witney - will David Cameron stay on as MP, after he steps down as prime minister? Those who experienced the \"hard border\" that existed between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland during the Troubles will shudder at the memory of long queues of traffic as ID was checked and vehicles searched, writes Vincent Kearney. On a bad day, the security checks could add a good hour to a round trip between Belfast and Dublin. Some in the Remain camp argued that a vote to exit the EU would see a return of permanent border checkpoints. Those in the Leave camp, including Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, insisted that was nonsense. So what now? The honest answer is that nobody quite knows. We have seen a very surprising pattern - working-class Labour voters going fairly solidly \"Vote Leave,\" far more strongly than we were expecting, writes Vaughan Roderick. Leave won Bridgend - which is First Minister Carwyn Jones' territory - and they won Rhondda Cynon Taff, which is Leanne Wood's home territory. So maybe it is not the individual politicians we should be looking at - it is actually a question of income and social class more than political affiliation or political leadership. Are we looking at a situation where people who felt they have had nothing to lose voted to leave, whereas people who feel they have something to lose - Labour or Conservative - decided to vote remain?",
        "Surprise frontrunner Francois Fillon said his project was \"more radical,\" and vowed to implement sweeping changes in the first three months of his term. Alain Juppe insisted his proposals were \"deep and credible\" but lacked the \"brutality\" of Mr Fillon's plans. It was the final Republicans party debate before Sunday's concluding vote. The Republicans candidate is widely expected to face far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen in a runoff vote in the presidential election next May. Self-declared supporters of the centre-right values are choosing between the two former prime ministers. It is the party's first such primary vote, modelled on the US system. Seven candidates were whittled down to two last Sunday, with Mr Fillon taking an unexpectedly decisive lead of 44.1 to Mr Juppe's 28.5. Juppe v Fillon: Battle of France's conservatives Press review: France's'Mr Nobody' Francois Fillon Fillon under fire over women's rights The past week has seen a campaign marked by a bitter row over the nature Mr Fillon's social policies. Mr Juppe provoked a furious reaction when he questioned whether Mr Fillon, a Roman Catholic, could seek to challenge the legality of abortion. But polling suggests such tactics seem to have backfired on Mr Juppe, once the favourite seen as the safe choice. A poll of 908 debate viewers by Elabe suggested 71 of conservative respondents found Mr Fillon more convincing, as did 57 of viewers of all political stripes. \"It is true that my project is more radical and perhaps more difficult,\" said Mr Fillon. His controversial economic reforms include cutting half a million public sector jobs and scrapping the 35-hour work week, prompting comparisons to the late British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Mr Juppe also proposes cutting jobs and liberalising work hours, though to a lesser extent. Both propose roughly similar cuts to public spending of at least a'!100bn (PS85bn; 106bn). \"I've got a plan for the reforms I want to make in the first three months of the presidential term - and I'm convinced if we don't get these changes implemented in the first three months, the French people will feel disheartened, they'll turn away from politics, and then there'll be a greater risk of the extremists winning,\" Mr Fillon said. The country was \"on the brink of revolt,\" which could only be averted with such radical action. Conservative Le Figaro says the debate \"eased tensions on the right\" and showed the two contenders \"have already formed identical visions and almost similar projects\" - in particular the need to end the \"vicious cycle of spending and debt.\" They have \"some differences on security, education and migration, but they are minor,\" concludes its political editor. But centre-left Le Monde's political correspondent disagrees, seeing \"significant differences\" on the European Union, Russia and Syria. While Mr Fillon wants to \"respect the sovereignty\" of EU member states, Mr Juppe favours a \"powerful EU as a future world power.\" On Syria, Mr Fillon wants to put France \"back in play\" by \"opening a channel to Damascus,\" whereas Mr Juppe wants to \"boost transatlantic co-operation\" and takes a firm line against President Bashar al-Assad, Le Monde says. Left-wing Liberation writes that the debate between \"Fillon the radical and Juppe the reconciler\" was \"knotty, often tense, but not aggressive.\" It thought Mr Juppe managed to score points over his opponent on some issues, but \"not enough to trouble the winner of the first round.\" BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world. You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook. Mr Juppe hit back at Mr Fillon, saying \"reform should not be a punishment but bring hope.\" \"The French social model exists, I want to consolidate it.... not break it,\" Mr Juppe said, referring to the welfare system. Mr Juppe pledged to bring unity and stability to the presidency - whose current Socialist incumbent, Francois Hollande, has seen his popularity drop to historic lows. He said he would choose a \"loyal\" PM and 15 \"durable\" cabinet ministers who would not \"change every 18 months.\"",
        "US lifeline for death row dog Stella Stella was seized by Devon and Cornwall Police in 2014 and kept in a cage without exercise. A campaign to save Stella has gained momentum with more than 20,000 signatures on combined petitions. Police said the dog was \"deemed too dangerous to walk due to her aggressive behaviour.\" Nicole Bruck, from the pit bull rescue centre Animals R Family based in Connecticut said: \"We will take Stella and fly her to the US at our cost. Breed specific legislation is banned in Connecticut. \"Breed specific legislation is wrong and ineffective. In the US, pit bulls are one of the most popular dogs for family pet.\" Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed Stella's owner has \"launched a late appeal against the destruction order against Stella\" and she will \"remain in kennels until the outcome of the appeal is known.\" Owner Anthony Hastie had 21 days to appeal a destruction order passed by Torquay Magistrates' Court on 8 February. Tina Wagon, from the firm Wheldon Law, is acting on behalf of Mr Hastie. Ms Wagon said: \"Plan A is that Antony would like his dog back. Plan B is for us to get some help.\" Mr Hastie said: \"The appeal has been lodged now. I want Stella back, but if that's not possible I just want to make sure she's kept alive.\" Animals R Family states on its website: \"We rescue cats and dogs who have been abused, neglected, abandoned, and provide vet care, training, food, shelter and lots of love, while finding them a loving, forever home.\" A joint statement from Devon and Cornwall Police and the Police and Crime Commissioner on the forces website said \"we wish to answer as many of the concerns as possible on this highly emotive issue.\" Chief Superintendent Jim Nye said: \"Many of you have been in contact following BBC Inside Out's story on dangerous dog Stella. \"We had to seize Stella, she is both an illegal breed and an extremely dangerous dog. \"The welfare of dogs are extremely important to us. In the past year we have seized in the region of 100 dogs, and only Stella has been assessed as too dangerous and unpredictable for kennel staff to walk. \"Stella was used on two occasions as a weapon by the owner in a threat to attack police personnel prior to being seized. \"The dog has then also attempted to bite a number of independent animal behavioural experts who tried to interact with her during their appraisals.\" The statement did not say if any prosecution resulted from the alleged use of Stella as a weapon to threaten police, but Mr Hastie told the BBC he has never been arrested over the matter. Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Hogg said: \"The protracted legal process is wrong both in the way it has prolonged the dog's incarceration and in the cost to the public purse. \"It has cost the public PS10,000 to keep the dog in kennels. The defence was responsible for 10 of those [11] adjournments so I am satisfied that the delay cannot be laid at the door of the police. \"Following the outcome of the appeal, we will encourage the force to seek recovery of the costs involved in this case from the owner.\"",
        "Officials at Grade II listed Guildford Cathedral said last year it was at risk because of deteriorating plasterwork, which contained asbestos. A PS7m fundraising campaign was launched and now has only PS500,000 left to meet the final target. Preparatory work will begin next month before building starts in October. The building, which is the last Church of England cathedral to be consecrated on a new site, is visible for miles from its Stag Hill location. Earlier this month, the cathedral was awarded a PS4.6m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. It has also raised funds from donations and a \"buy a brick\" campaign, which more than 200,000 people took part in. \"Guildford Cathedral is a unique and vital community resource that brings people together,\" Mayor of Guildford David Elms, told a benefactor reception on Tuesday. \"So many have already responded - because saving the cathedral matters.\" Repairs and improvements will include restoration of the cathedral's organ, better disabled access, new lighting and sound system and making its archive materials more easily available to the public.",
        "The All Blacks were five points behind at half-time with a man in the sin-bin as four penalties from Handre Pollard cancelled out Jerome Kaino's early try. A Dan Carter drop-goal and a Beauden Barrett try put the champions ahead. South Africa replied with two penalties but a Carter effort in between secured victory despite ferocious Bok defence. It was seldom pretty but once again in this World Cup there was a gripping finale, the All Blacks holding that two-point lead for the last 12 minutes as their opponents finally tired. No team has ever retained the Webb Ellis trophy, but the All Blacks will be favourites to do so when they meet either Australia or Argentina next Saturday after finding their way through a brutal encounter. This was nothing like the free-flowing attacking rugby that had eviscerated France in the quarter-finals, but in its own way it was just as admirable, as South Africa refused to buckle despite having just 43 possession. The game swung in the 20 minutes after half-time, New Zealand beginning that period five points down and with Kaino off the pitch, but ending it five points up and with Springbok wing Bryan Habana in the sin-bin instead. And despite replacement Pat Lambie cutting the lead to less than a score, the vast experience of the champions saw them through. After Pollard's early penalty, the All Blacks struck back when Kaino thundered through De Jager down the right and touched down one-handed in the corner, but two more pin-point penalties from Pollard gave his side a two-point lead with 20 minutes gone. South Africa were having significant success at the breakdown, New Zealand shipping six penalties in short order, and the world champions looked instead for territory, kicking behind the defence and into the corners. Carter hit the post with a long-range penalty, and despite his side dominating possession and territory the Springbok defensive wall continued to hold. When South Africa finally made it out of their half, they struck again. Kaino was sin-binned for kicking the ball away and Pollard stroked over his fourth penalty to make it 12-7 at the interval, the green-shirted supporters in the capacity crowd starting to believe that the upset was on. The Springboks had not lost to the All Blacks in 21 Tests when leading or level at half-time, but despite being a man down New Zealand closed the gap to two points as a spell of carefully worked territory was capped with a Carter drop-goal. Schalk Burger then lost the ball metres from his own line, the All Blacks went right and drove on through their forwards before Ma'a Nonu sent replacement Barrett diving into the corner. With Habana sin-binned for knocking the ball from scrum-half Aaron Smith's hands and Carter bending over the conversion for 17-12, the match appeared to have turned. Pollard and Carter exchanged penalties, and with replacements pouring on to the pitch and the rain hammering down the two heavyweights went toe to toe. Pat Lambie came on for Pollard to make it 20-18 with 10 minutes to go, and an air of desperation was apparent in both sides. Carter sprinted half the length of the pitch to clear from De Allende, South Africa failed to capitalise from an attacking line-out and New Zealand escaped into opposition territory as the seconds crawled by, running the clock down with a series of drives to celebrate with exhaustion at the end. Ben Smith was faultless under the high ball and Dan Carter's decision-making once again peerless. However, for his muscular, repeated carrying in a relentlessly physical match and the superb run and timing of pass for Beauden Barrettt's critical second-half try, Ma'a Nonu deserves the honour. New Zealand coach Steve Hansen: \"It was always going to be close, they're a great side and they showed that again. I was really proud of our guys, they kept their composure. \"We just needed to come out for the second half and start taking the game to them rather than waiting for them to take it to us. We talked about it at half-time. We talked about keeping composure and talked about winning the first 10 minutes.\" South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer: \"Our discipline in the second half was just not good enough. They coped better with the weather in the second half. Discipline was the most important thing, especially in these rainy conditions. \"We wanted to make our country proud but we didn't. We should have pulled this win through but all credit to the All Blacks, they are a quality side.\" South Africa: Le Roux; Pietersen, Kriel, de Allende, Habana; Pollard, du Preez; Mtawarira, B. du Plessis, Malherbe; Etzebeth, de Jager; Louw, Burger, Vermeulen Replacements: Serfontein for de Allende (80), Lambie for Pollard (66), Nyakane for Mtawarira (53), Strauss for B. du Plessis (53), J. du Plessis for Malherbe (60), Matfield for de Jager (60), Alberts for Burger (64) Not Used: Pienaar Sin Bin: Habana (52) New Zealand: B.

        "As a result, how - and not just whether - a claimant is able to accomplish tasks like walking and planning journeys will help determine the amount they are entitled to in benefits. Claimants who manage the tasks, but not \"reliably,\" will get higher payments. Ministers admitted there were concerns that the proposals were \"unclear.\" The Personal Independence Payment (PIP) will replace the existing Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in April. People who are less mobile will be entitled to higher payments. Campaigners had warned that people deemed capable of walking more than 20 metres could receive lower payments - even if they were unable to do so \"safely, reliably, repeatedly and in a reasonable time period.\" Ministers had previously denied the claim and argued that these words did not need to be written into legally binding regulations. But minister for disabled Esther McVey said on Thursday: \"I know that disabled people and their representatives feel strongly that this important concept is set out in law and I am happy to do this.\" She added: \"Our intention has always been the same - we want to target support at those who need it most. \"We have always said that we will not just look at whether individuals can carry out activities but also the manner in which they do so.\" Critics of the government's changes say one third of disabled people live in poverty and an estimated 42 fewer people would be eligible for mobility allowance as a result. In exchanges in the House of Lords last week, Crossbencher Baroness Grey-Thompson, a Paralympic gold medallist, criticised the government for its \"lack of consultation with disabled people\" about the proposals. Fellow crossbencher Lord Alton has said the fact people will have specially adapted vehicles taken away from them had caused \"widespread disbelief and considerable distress.\" For ministers, Lord Freud conceded: \"I have to accept that there was inadequate discussion of the changes and that there is inadequate understanding of them.\"",

        "Lagavulin is launching a single cask edition of 522 bottles of its single malt to raise funds for local projects. Sales of the PS1,494 bottles are set to see PS310,000 donated to Islay Heritage to help build a story of the island's past based on its archaeological sites. The Finlaggan Trust, which maintains the historical home of the Lord of the Isles, should also receive PS60,000. The Lagavulin 200 Legacy is set to make further contributions to the local swimming pool, cyber cafe and arts and festival organisations, as well as a new partnership with the RSPB to restore and conserve peatlands on the island. Nick Morgan, of Lagavulin's owners Diageo, said: \"We have had a fantastic year celebrating the 200th anniversary of Lagavulin, both on Islay and with the hundreds of thousands of people around the world who adore the whisky. \"Islay and its remarkable local community are at the heart of Lagavulin. \"That's why we were determined there should be a legacy from the anniversary which would directly benefit the island and its people. \"We believe that our contribution to Islay Heritage is not only of great significance to the island itself but is an important contribution to conserving and promoting the history and heritage of Scotland.\" Bottles of the Lagavulin 1991 Single Malt Scotch Whisky cask can only be purchased through an online ballot on The Whisky Exchange.

        "The UK will maintain an EU deal, which provides 48 countries with duty-free access to Britain for imports. It means British firms do not pay import tariffs on goods bought from countries such as Bangladesh and Haiti. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Brexit gave the country an opportunity \"to step up our commitments to the rest of the world.\" He added: \"Free and fair trade has been the greatest liberator of the world's poor, and today's announcement shows our commitment to helping developing countries grow their economies and reduce poverty through trade.\" The deal excludes arms and ammunitions. The list of countries - which also includes Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda - is based on the UN's Least Developed Countries index. Currently PS19.2bn of goods are imported from the 48 countries, including 79 of the tea consumed in Britain. Some 45 of the UK's textile and clothing imports, and 22 of its coffee, also come from the developing nations. International Development Secretary Priti Patel said the renewed commitment would \"help the world's poorest people stand on their own two feet.\" She added: \"Building a more prosperous world and supporting our own long-term economic security is firmly in all our interests.\" The government also intends to explore options to expand relationships with richer countries like Jamaica, Pakistan and Ghana, which currently enjoy a mixture of reduced tariffs or zero tariffs.

Friday's acts include Florence and the Machine, Motorhead, Mark Ronson and an unconfirmed band, rumoured to be The Libertines, on the Pyramid Stage. However, Professor Stephen Hawking is unlikely to attend the event for an appearance in the Kidz Field. A spokesperson for the physicist told The Telegraph he had pulled out \"for personal reasons.\" In other Glastonbury news: Organisers have not confirmed the identity of the act who will fill the Pyramid Stage slot on Friday that was left vacant when Florence Welch was promoted to the headline slot. Rumours about Pete Doherty and Carl Barat's band The Libertines circulated after the name \"Albion\" was pictured on a backstage running order. The Libertines have used the word Albion frequently during their careers. Florence has replaced Foo Fighters, who pulled out when frontman Dave Grohl broke his leg. The decision to promote Florence and the Machine to headline status was criticised by some fans, but organiser Emily Eavis said she made the decision \"straight away.\" \"This is her moment,\" Eavis said. \"She's had a number one record in America, a number one record here, and she's on fire.\" 'Culture of rebellion' Meanwhile, feminist punk band Pussy Riot made an appearance in front of the Park Stage, using a theatrical protest to convey their anti-government message.

Pussy Riot's Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, who were imprisoned in Russia for almost two years for their protests, then climbed up, tied him up and put one of their trademark multi-coloured balaclavas on him.

        "And many of those communities will have voted Labour. For years this was a party heartland which was home to big beasts like Tam Dalyell and Robin Cook. Before his death, Mr Cook had a majority of more than 13,000 - he commanded the support of more than half of the electorate. But much has changed here. The mines are closed, the economy is now focussed on some remnants of small industry, retail and elsewhere. Livingston and its surrounding towns often acts as feeders for Edinburgh. Robin Chesters is director at the Scottish Shale Industry Museum. \"There are still communities here who remember those days,\" he says, \"it's the parents, it's the grandparents - but in places like Livingston there have been tremendous changes in population.\" The Labour candidate here is a vocal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. And she thinks the Labour leader's message is appealing to voters. \"I think for a long time communities like this were taken for granted the SNP had something really positive to offer - that was independence. But we've now seen the reality,\" she says, referring to a perceived lack of progress under the SNP Scottish government. The choice, she says, is clear: A Labour government or a Conservative government. \"I think that's cutting through.\" Some here though don't seem to mind the idea of a Conservative government all that much. The Tories here are buoyed by local election results and national opinion polls. Their candidate thinks he is in with a good chance of beating Ms Wolfson - putting the party once seen as the enemy of miners above Labour for the first time in modern history here. Damian Timson says: \"There are two types of Conservatives - there's this bogeyman conservative that people talk about and then there's the real conservative; the likes of myself and Ruth Davidson and everyone else and I think at last the message has got out that we're a party for everyone.\" But this seat was won comfortably by the SNP in 2015 - Hannah Bardell took even more of the vote that Robin Cook had back in 2005 (she won 57 of the vote - a majority of almost 17,000). \"People have found that the SNP have been a strong voice for them in Livingston - I've done everything in my power to raise constituency issues on the floor of the house,\" she says. \"There has certainly been big changes in Livingston. But what West Lothian and Livingston have been very good at doing is bouncing back - and what the SNP have offered is support for the new industries.\" The Lib Dem candidate Charlie Dundas will be hoping he improves on his showing from 2015 - when the party won just 2.1 of the vote - losing its deposit and finishing behind UKIP. His pitch? \"There's only one party that is standing up for the two unions that they believe in - Livingston voted to remain in the UK back in 2014; Livingston voted to remain the EU.\"",
        "Co-operative Energy has already paid most of the compensation after customers were affected by a new IT system in March last year. The system's introduction led to direct debits being blocked and lengthy waits for new customers. The company has apologised and said it had improved the service. Regulator Ofgem got involved after complaints levels were running 50 higher for Co-operative Energy than any other supplier. Ofgem said these complaints were caused by customers being unable to log into their accounts online, leaving them unable to submit meter readings or check their bill. Bills were delayed and direct debit updates stopped. In addition, new customers also experienced delay transferring to the supplier. It also took too long to resolve a significant number of customer complaints, Ofgem said. In response, Co-op Energy stopped marketing its products, improved the service and has already paid PS1.6m in compensation. Martin Crouch, Ofgem senior partner said: \"While customers experienced unacceptable levels of service, Co-operative Energy has done the right thing by taking responsibility for the situation and paying out compensation to those people affected. \"If trust is to be restored in the energy market suppliers must make amends to their customers when things go wrong. We want all suppliers to constantly ensure customers are treated fairly.\" Ben Reid, chief executive of Midcounties Co-operative which runs Co-op Energy. said: \"As the UK's only member-owned energy supplier, we put our customers at the heart of everything we do and their interests first. \"We have apologised to those customers who were affected by the problems we experienced when we introduced a new IT system last year. The system issues are now resolved and we have made significant improvements to our service.\" On 1 October, Co-operative Energy increased prices for both gas and electricity by 3.",
        "The latest intake of Tory MPs is far and away the most Eurosceptic in the Conservative Party's history. Almost all of the pro-European \"big beasts\" of the ThatcherMajor years - men like Chris Patten and Michael Heseltine - are long gone from front-line politics. According to Tim Montgomerie, the assiduous student of backbench opinion who writes for the website Conservative Home, a third of those now on the Conservative benches would like to see a fundamental renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Europe, and another third would like Britain to come out altogether. The estimate of more than a hundred outright \"withdrawalists\" - Conservatives who essentially believe in the European policy of the UK Independence Party - suggests many Tory MPs are being coy about what they really believe. Only ten Conservative MPs have declared their position publicly, by joining the \"Better Off Out\" group, which campaigns openly for withdrawal. Today Euroscepticism is the iceberg of Tory politics; only the top is visible, but a large and - for the leadership - possibly dangerous mass lies beneath the water. That impression is reinforced by the fact that two of the MPs I interviewed for BBC Radio 4's Analysis would talk only on condition we concealed their identity. One of them told me that even though his views are, he believes, now \"mainstream\" in his party, he still sees support for EU withdrawal in Wildean terms as \"the love that dare not speak its name.\" The other complained of a \"supine approach\" to Europe by the Party's leadership since it came into government. When the Conservatives were in opposition, David Cameron made a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that, should he be elected Prime Minister, he would hold a referendum on any EU Treaty that emerged, as \"no treaty should be ratified without consulting the British people in a referendum.\" The Lisbon treaty was ratified by all EU states before the 2010 general election, but critics maintain that David Cameron reneged on his promise. \"The collateral damage from that broken promise,\" our un-nameable MP said, \"is a bit of a black cloud over the government even now.\" Could the government ship be heading towards a collision with the Eurosceptic iceberg? There are signs of new currents of opinion on Europe swirling through the left of British politics too. Last year, during the Labour leadership campaign, Ed Balls questioned one of the principles at the heart of the EU and its single market, the free movement of labour. Mr Balls, now shadow chancellor, said he wanted to stop \"the practice where people can work in our country and send benefits back to their own countries.\" That theme has been picked up by Lord Glasman, the driving force behind the Blue Labour movement - which aims to revitalise the party's traditional grassroots support - and an influential adviser to the Labour leader Ed Miliband. Maurice Glasman argues against the current EU rules which, he says, encourage people in poorer member states to leave their families to work overseas, arguing the practice can depress workers' incomes in richer economies. He told Analysis he would be happy to make common cause with Tory Eurosceptics if he concluded it would advance his cause. All these factors suggest that Europe could soon occupy centre stage in British politics once again. And the crisis in the eurozone has offered a golden opportunity to those pushing the government to engage in debate about Europe. Douglas Carswell, Tory backbench MP for Clacton in Essex, and one of the small group of Better Off Out MPs, argues that the eurozone crisis has destroyed the economic case for EU membership: \"Far from joining a prosperous trading bloc,\" he says, \"we shackled ourselves to a corpse. We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn't even join.\" But Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views, as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a salient issue at this stage of the current parliament. Tory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw. There is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery, not Europe, must be the government's priority. \"So long as Britain is in an economic crisis,\" says Tim Montgomerie, \"every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that, and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity.\" Analysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST Download the Analysis podcast Listen via the Radio 4 website Follow Analysis on Facebook Last month a group of more than a hundred Conservative MPs met in the Thatcher Room of the House of Commons to debate a European strategy. The meeting's convener, the young MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, and former Cameron aide George Eustice, said the group would be looking for \"new thinking\" on Europe, not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal. One of those who attended the meeting, Clare Perry, a prominent member of the new intake of Tory MPs, described \"this in-or-out discussion\" as \"a bit crude,\" and said she thinks the choice is between \"the status quo or a renegotiation of the relationship.\" The wildest card of all is what happens in Europe itself. Almost everyone now agrees that fundamental reform of the Eurozone is inevitable - whether the Euro survives as a currency or breaks apart. That in turn is bound to have an impact on Britain's relationship with the Eurozone countries, and may well force changes in the way the wider EU works. Former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont told Analysis that if the Eurozone countries form a tighter fiscal union, Britain might simply \"wave goodbye\" altogether. And Mark Seddon, a Labour Party activist who runs the People's Pledge campaign for a referendum on EU membership, believes the sort of changes that are likely to come will force the government to put the matter to the public. It is exhilaratingly uncharted territory, and the choices to be made will probably not become clear until much closer to the next election in 2015. Those MPs who are so nervous about debating Europe now, may find that by the time they are ready to come out, the terms of the debate have changed beyond all recognition.

        "Chiltern Edge School in Sonning Common had been rated inadequate by Ofsted after following the inspection in March. Inspectors also said pupil attainment was too low and a disadvantaged pupils' fund was not being used effectively. Oxfordshire County Council said it will begin consulting on Friday over whether the school should shut. The school, which educates children between 11 and 16 years old, received a good rating from Ofsted in 2012. But after the most recent inspection, the watchdog said the school had shown a lack of management and effective teaching, which led to pupils underperforming. It added: \"Standards in reading are too low. Pupils do not read well or widely enough. \"This restricts their access to the wider curriculum.\" The council will discuss the potential closure of the 500-pupil school with parents on 3 May. A spokesman said the consultation - which will run until 16 June - will explore the potential impacts of the closure and how it can provide good-quality education to pupils. Director of children's services Lucy Butler, said: \"It's important to stress at this stage that no decisions have been taken and that the school would not close without appropriate transfer arrangements in place for every child to attend a better-performing school.\" The school would not comment on the potential closure, but a letter to parents read: \"Inevitably, this is a time of great concern and uncertainty for everyone but I assure you that everything possible will be done to safeguard the education and progress of our students.\"",

Mr Assange said that his organisation had \"a lot more information on the cyber-weapons programme.\" He added that while Wikileaks maintained a neutral position on most of its leaks, in this case it did take a strong stance. \"We want to secure communications technology because, without it, journalists aren't able to hold the state to account,\" he said. Mr Assange also claimed that the intelligence service had known for weeks that Wikileaks had access to the material and done nothing about it.

He claimed that an anti-virus expert, who was not named, had come forward to say that he believed sophisticated malware that he had previously attributed to Iran, Russia and China, now looked like something that the CIA had developed. \"The type of attack system corresponds to a description we published of that attack system unless of course China has already got hold of these parts of the CIA arsenal and is using it to pretend to be the CIA,\" said Mr Assange.

        "The 70-year-old Time Team presenter joined anti-tunnel campaigners to fight the plans, saying they placed the area's wider archaeology at risk. The protest by the Stonehenge Alliance was staged outside a consultation event in London earlier. Highways England said it was working to find \"the best solution possible.\" The public consultation on its plans for putting the A303 into a 1.8-mile (2.9km) dual carriageway tunnel runs until 5 March. Highways England says the move would cut congestion and improve journey times. The scheme has the backing of English Heritage and the National Trust. Speaking outside the Society of Antiquaries at Burlington House, Robinson suggested a longer tunnel. He said: \"I think the proposal we are being offered is a really old-fashioned one. \"It assumes what needs to be protected is that little clump of stones.\" He said it was only over the past three decades archaeologists had begun to comprehend the wider significance of the site. \"That's a high-class Wiltshire Disneyland experience,\" he said. \"Once it's gone, we'll never get that back. \"If you were going to protect Buckingham Palace, you wouldn't put a tunnel in halfway down the Mall.\" The Stonehenge Alliance wants other options to reduce traffic to be fully explored. Spokeswoman Dr Kate Fielden said: \"We want a genuine consultation with real choice. \"Both of Highways England's options involve huge and damaging new roadworks gouged into our most important ancient landscape.\" A spokesman for Highways England said: \"We fully understand the cultural heritage of the site and one of the broad objectives of the scheme is to help conserve and enhance the World Heritage Site by removing the sight and sound of traffic and make it easier to reach and explore.\"",
        "The knee-high footballers, based at the University of Hertfordshire, are not exactly pacey. And they are not very good at gaining possession - especially if they spot someone such as me, wearing red shoes, which they mistake for the similarly red, but round, ball because they have been programmed to spot colour rather than shape. When they do get to the ball, they stop to look around before they kick it And once they have kicked it, they are liable to fall over. They also kick each other, although I'm assured that will not count as a foul. \"The kicking is most likely unintentional,\" says their manager, Prof Daniel Polani. \"We don't yet have robots that understand that kicking will hurt other robots. He thinks that he has seen the ball.\" The robots are pre-programmed - an estimated 50,000 lines of code go into preparing for a match - but there is also an element of learning. They \"speak\" to their trainers as they play, explaining what they are seeing. And when they are configured for the next match all that information can be used to raise their game. These robots have form. In last year's competition, in Brazil, they were runners up. But there is no room for complacency. \"We would like to win, but every game needs to be won,\" says Prof Polani. \"It is much harder this year, and many of the rules have changed, so we have to start again from the beginning and work our way up.\" Changes include making the playing surface more like Astroturf, meaning it will be even harder for the robots to stay upright. And the ball will be white, making it harder for them to spot. The RoboCup has been running since 1997, and each year sees ever more sophisticated robots taking part. And it has grown from 38 teams from 11 countries to over 500 teams taking part from more than 45 countries. It may not have as big a fan base as the World Cup, but there is no shortage of supporters cheering on the robots. Originally conceived as a way of advancing the development of artificial intelligence, the ultimate aim is for a team of robots to take on and beat their human World Cup winning counterparts in 2050. Watching the little guys perform, this seems unlikely - but Prof Polani remains hopeful. \"Ten years ago, this would have seemed difficult - but we have made such huge progress in the last 10 years, that it is definitely possible,\" he said. \"It is not entirely unrealistic.\"",
        "Russia's plan for \"de-escalation\" zones was backed by Iran at talks in Kazakhstan. Both countries support Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Turkey, which supports rebel groups, also agreed to act as a guarantor. But some delegates from the rebel forces angrily rejected the plan. As the three countries were invited to sign the document on Thursday in the Kazakh capital, Astana, rebel delegates angrily shouted that they did not accept it and walked out. Reporters at the talks said the rebels were unhappy about Iran's involvement in the deal as a guarantor. The US also expressed concern over Iran, saying the country had \"only contributed to the violence, not stopped it.\" The Syrian government is not a signatory, but its state news agency said it supported the plan. The talks were meant to shore up an oft-violated ceasefire which was originally agreed in December. A partial cessation of hostilities was declared at the end of last year, but violence has continued on several fronts. Under the Russian plan, safe zones would be established in rebel-held territory in the north-western province of Idlib, in parts of Homs province in the centre, in the south, and in the opposition enclave of Eastern Ghouta near Damascus, the AFP news agency reported. Syrian and Russian warplanes would stop bombing rebel positions while opposition groups would halt attacks inside the \"de-escalation zones.\" The objective is to \"put an immediate end to the violence\" and \"provide the conditions for the safe, voluntary return of refugees\" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The safe zones would remain in place for six months, the Kremlin has said. They would be surrounded by checkpoints manned by rebels and government troops, and foreign troops could also be deployed in observer roles, according to AFP. The UN's envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, called the agreement a step in the right direction. Syria's envoy to the UN Bashar al-Jaafari said he hoped Russia and Iran would discuss the plan's details with the Syrian government as soon as possible. Syria's war has claimed more than 300,000 lives since it erupted in 2011.",
        "Biologists studied a group of Sydney octopuses off Australia's east coast and observed a range of behaviour that may indicate complex social signalling. Octopuses that stand tall, turn dark and spread their web in a \"Nosferatu pose\" are likely showing aggression. Conversely, octopuses may display a pale colour after losing a fight or when trying to avoid conflict. It was previously believed that octopuses were largely solitary creatures. Changes to body colour and other behaviour were interpreted as tactics to avoid predators. But Prof Peter Godfrey-Smith said the unique study, based on 53 hours of footage and published on Friday in the journal Current Biology, provided a novel perspective on octopus behaviour. An aggressive] octopus will turn very dark, stand in a way that accentuates its size and it will often seek to stand on a higher spot,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith, who co-authored the report, said. \"Clearly the unusual stance is not a physiological response. It makes it look as big as it can possibly be, with its arms spread out below and the mantle, the back part of the animal, raised over the head. \"The dark colour is produced in concert with those size-accentuating behaviours. There's no particular physiological reason why darkness should be associated with aggression, but it does give the impression of a larger object.\" The researchers, based in Australia and the US, dubbed the stance the \"Nosferatu pose,\" referring to the classic 1920s horror film, because the spread of the octopus's web was reminiscent of a vampire's cape. Octopuses frequently turned pale while retreating from aggressors and also produced high-contrast patterns known as deimatic displays. The contrasting patterns were most frequently observed when octopuses were attempting to return to their den after they had been forced out, or in the presence of an aggressive individual. \"Suppose there's a large, aggressive guy there and you want to get back into our den, if you approach with a pale colour it could be interpreted as a non-confrontational behaviour,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith said. The study also found that two octopuses displaying dark colours were likely to fight if in close proximity, while a darker-coloured octopus was likely to stand its ground against a lighter-coloured octopus. Another cephalopod, the cuttlefish, shows a similar set of features, with aggressive males darkening their faces and paler males withdrawing from fights. The unusually high number of octopuses living together in the colony off Jervis Bay, south of Sydney, allowed a more in-depth observation of interactions than had previously been possible. Prof Godfrey-Smith's co-author David Scheel and his students combed through 53 hours of footage and observed 186 interactions between the octopuses. This included the Nosferatu pose, along with reaching, grappling and mating. Watching these long videos was \"much more exhausting than I expected,\" Prof Godfrey Smith said. \"Identifying an individual from minute to minute is very difficult, because they change colour and shape. \"If the octopus wanders out of the frame, there's not much you can do.\"",
        "Mr Smith played a central role in the ceasefire of loyalist paramilitary groups in 1994. The announcement came six weeks after the IRA announced its own ceasefire. Mr Smith spent ten years in prison for his role in the shooting of a Catholic in 1972. After his released from prison, Mr Smith became a member of the PUP. In 1994, Mr Smith chaired a press conference in which a statement on behalf of the Combined Loyalist Military Command was read out by Gusty Spence, a founding member of the UVF. He later served as the chairman of the PUP and was part of the party's negotiating team around the Good Friday Agreement.

The cut in investment - spread over three years - comes after a fall in the oil price. Although the price is expected to remain lower in the medium term, Mr van Beurden said: \"We are taking a prudent approach here and we must be careful not to over-react to the recent fall in oil prices. \"Shell is taking structured decisions to balance growth and returns.\" Shell also said profits for the last three months of 2014 had risen to 4.2bn compared with 2.2bn in the same period a year earlier. The numbers were below analysts' forecasts, prompting a big sell-off of Shell's shares, which were down by 4.3 at the end of Thursday. Shell put its Arctic plans on hold two years ago after a drilling vessel ran aground and legal wrangles in the US. The company has already spent 1bn on preparing its drilling work in Alaska's Chukchi Sea. It was costing Shell several hundred millions of dollars a year to keep the existing operations ticking over, the company said. Mr van Beurden said there were still issues to resolve before drilling began, such as over operating permits and getting further facilities in place. But he hoped to see work begin in the summer. \"We will only do this if we feel that we can do it responsibly,\" Mr van Beurden told the BBC. \"I think that we are as well prepared as any company can be to mitigate the risks.\" He also pointed out that there are already other energy companies operating in the Arctic. Mr van Beurden said that the world needs new sources of oil and gas to meet demand and that the Arctic offered potentially the biggest resource base ever found. Estimates have put the estimates at some 24bn barrels in Alaska. Environmentalists have campaigned against Shell for years. Greenpeace's Charlie Kronick, said: \"Despite announcing cuts [in global investment], Shell hasn't taken the opportunity to cut its most high-cost high-risk project. \"Shell is taking a massive risk doggedly chasing oil in the Arctic, not just with shareholder value, but with the pristine Arctic environment. \"A spill there will be environmentally and financially catastrophic. It's time for investors to recognise that it's impossible for Shell to justify its continued pursuit of offshore Arctic oil.\" As the first of the major oil companies to report its figures for last year, Shell plays the role of the canary in the coal mine - or on the oil rig. After a rather sickly 2013, profits are actually up. But the impact of the low oil price is clearly biting. The company announced that it would be cutting investment over the next three years in new exploration and the development of oil and gas fields, a move that will raise fresh concerns about its business in the North Sea. Last summer Shell announced the loss of 250 jobs in Aberdeen. The chief executive, Ben Van Beurden, said that the company would not \"over-react\" to the oil price which has fallen by 60 since last June. And of course a low oil price means lower prices at the petrol pumps for consumers. He said though that Shell would look at further cuts if necessary. As well as the North Sea, the company's operations in Nigeria, where it recently paid a PS55m bill to clean up pollution after a major oil spill, and the Arctic will also come under increased scrutiny. Meanwhile, Shell's profits for the quarter after stripping out one-off items, such as asset sales and accounting changes, were 3.26bn. That is a 12 rise on the same period a year earlier but down from the 5.85bn in the June to September quarter. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \"As expected, fourth quarter performance has been impacted by the lower oil price, although downstream refining operations have provided some counterbalance. \"More broadly, the numbers are below forecast, with the news providing a difficult start to the oil majors' results season. \"In all, and despite the disappointing numbers, the dividend payment remains core, with the payment being left unchanged.\" Shell said it was spending 12bn on dividends to shareholders in 2014, and also repurchased 3.3bn of its own shares. The group said it had slowed the pace of share buybacks to conserve cash and that near-term oil prices would dictate how it progressed. Oil prices have fallen by almost 60 since June because of weak global demand and a boom in US shale production. Shell's main rivals, BP and Total, have also announced large cutbacks in capital expenditure in recent weeks.",
        "Of 1,763 would-be students who had contacted or applied to UK universities, almost half said Brexit would make UK study less attractive. But 17 told international student recruiters Hobsons that Brexit would make UK universities more attractive. The Vote Leave campaign said it was crucial to ensure there were enough places for young people from the UK. Hobsons managing director Jeremy Cooper said: \"A vote for Brexit would represent a further challenge. \"For universities in the UK, the conditions for recruiting international students are tougher than ever before.\" The survey participants had applied for or enquired about study at 15 UK universities - including two from the elite Russell Group and seven new universities. Three-quarters were from countries outside the EU, two-thirds were interested in post-graduate study, just over half were female and almost two-thirds were aged under 24. Of the 1,529 who expressed an opinion: There was considerable variation between EU and non-EU students, with 82 of EU students saying Brexit would make the UK less attractive compared with 35 of non-EU students. Although they admit accurate predictions are impossible, the researchers believe international student applications could be at risk if attitudes change as the survey suggests. Based on 2014-15 figures, when there were 240,767, international students in the UK, 113,116 international students \"could be at risk of being put off\" studying in the UK, says the report. It suggests the UK could potentially lose 50,056 EU and 63,060 non-EU students. Paul Blomfield MP, co-chairman of the newly formed all-party parliamentary group for international students, called the report \"worrying\" \"Leaving the EU would make the UK a less attractive destination for study, and that is bad news for our economy,\" he said. \"Across the country, hundreds of thousands of jobs would be at risk.\" His co-chairman, Lord Bilimoria, said the findings were consistent with views he had been hearing from around the world. \"It is not scaremongering,\" he said. \"It is reality. The whole world thinks we should stay in the EU. \"International students are one of our biggest most important export earners. \"They affect our economy and our soft power - building bridges with our country for generations.\" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, warned that \"leaving the EU and putting up barriers to work and study are highly likely to mean that international students choose to study elsewhere, strengthening our competitors and weakening the UK's universities.\" But a Vote Leave spokeswoman pointed out that only a small percentage of students from outside Europe believed the referendum result would make any difference to their opinion of the attractiveness of studying at a UK university. \"The UK has some of the best universities in the world and gaining a place is often extremely competitive. That's something we're rightly proud of as a country. \"Understandably, the calibre of our universities attracts a large number of applications from foreign students - but arguably the most important thing is to ensure that there are sufficient places for our young people.\" And a spokesman for Scientists for Britain noted \"a huge difference between the'UK study less attractive' response from non-EU students (35), who contribute up-front and pay higher tuition fees, and EU students, who pay lower fees and are eligible to access UK student loans.\" \"Given that the financial contribution of non-EU students is significantly more important to the UK Higher Education sector, we are reassured that the vast majority of non-EU students (65) recognise that Brexit is much less of a concern for them, and may even level the playing field in terms of being able to secure student visas to study in the UK.\"",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device Sexton, 30, has suffered several concussions and was forced off in the 69th minute of Ireland's defeat by France on 13 February. Jones said: \"We target players all the time. That's part of rugby isn't it? \"I'm not saying Sexton is a weak defender, but we're going to target players because we want to win.\" Jones added that coaches have picked out particular opposition players in their tactical plans \"since Adam was a boy,\" revealing that he had told his players to run at England fly-half Jonny Wilkinson's injured right shoulder when coaching Australia in the 2003 World Cup final. The treatment meted out to fly-half Sexton in Paris - including an off-the-ball shoulder charge by second row Yoann Maestri early in the first half - was criticised by Ireland coach Joe Schmidt. Maestri escaped a ban after the incident was reviewed by the citing commissioner. Sexton was diagnosed with whiplash injuries to his neck and shoulder after the match. Media playback is not supported on this device Jones said that he wanted England to be \"brutal\" but legal in his first match at Twickenham since taking charge of England in November. He said: \"It's not illegal to target someone. I don't want our players to do anything illegal in terms of the laws. We want to be physical, fair and brutal. \"They've talked about him having whiplash injuries, which isn't a great thing to talk about. I'm sure his mother and father would be worried about that.\" Captain Dylan Hartley added: \"If there's a weak defender in the team, you put your best ball carrier at that weak defender. But a weak defender could be a lazy tight-head whose legs have gone. It's not because they're physically weak, it can be for other reasons.\" Sexton spent 12 weeks on the sidelines between November 2014 and February 2015 as part of a enforced lay-off following a four concussions in a year while playing his club rugby for Racing Metro in France. Some media commentators have called for Sexton to consider retiring to protect his long-term health with 69 of readers responding to an online poll by the Irish Independent newspaper suggesting he should stop playing. Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson told BBC Radio 5 live that Jones' comments were \"refreshing.\" Dawson said: \"Of course he has not overstepped the mark. That is the way that it is. Every single meeting between England and Ireland, they will have been targeting players they think are weak.\"",
        "Kaushik Basu, the former chief economist for the World Bank, says the \"collateral damage\" is likely to outstrip its benefits. The overnight ban on the notes last week was intended to crack down on corruption and so-called \"black money\" or illegal cash holdings. But it sparked scenes of chaos outside banks and ATMs. Low-income Indians, traders and ordinary savers who rely on the cash economy have been badly hit with hordes thronging banks to deposit expired money and withdraw lower denominations. As the anger mounted, the government raised limits on cash withdrawals on Sunday. But some economists say the move will have a limited impact as people will simply begin to accumulate black money in the new currency as soon as that becomes available. The government hopes this will bring cash worth billions of dollars in unaccounted wealth back into the economy. The two notes accounted for more than four-fifths of the currency in circulation. Prof Basu, who now teaches at New York's Cornell University, says India's Goods and Services tax, was \"good economics, but demonetisation is not.\" \"Its economics is complex and the collateral damage is likely to far outstrip the benefits,\" he says. What Prof Basu, who was chief economic adviser to the previous Congress government, means is that this \"demonetisation\" just witnessed in India is at best, a one-time flushing out of the system and the return of black money is likely if not inevitable. Many economists say the costs of such a one-time \"flush\" will be huge. They say hundreds of thousands of ordinary people (including farmers who do not even have bank accounts) who hold cash but not black money will get caught out and the fear of harassment by officials could trap them in a bureaucratic net they don't know how to deal with. So it is possible that all this achieves is a sudden curtailment in the total money supply, effectively a kind of contraction of the economy. Economists have long talked about \"helicopter drop\" of currency - printing large sums of money and distributing it to the public in order to stimulate the economy. India's decision to scrap high denomination notes is simply the reverse and according to economist Prabhat Patnaik the government's move \"betrays a lack of understanding of capitalism.\" \"Typically, what happens in capitalism in a situation like this is that there would be a new business opening up about how to change old currency notes into new ones.... A whole range of people would come up who will say you give us 1000 rupees and we will give you 800 rupees or 700 rupees or whatever. Consequently, instead of curbing black business it will actually give rise to the proliferation of black business,\" he told The Wire news site. But not all experts agree that it is such a risky move. \"India now operates under a monetary policy regime known as inflation targeting. If a portion of the stock of currency in circulation, consisting of currency and demand deposits gets'burned', metaphorically or literally, the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, can in principle fully offset this through what economists call'open market operations',\" Vivek Dehejia says. \"These involve purchasing bonds from the markets and injecting money (and therefore liquidity) into the markets in return. This is standard operating procedure for central banks.\" To put it more simply: suppose a warehouse of cash owned by someone goes up in flames and the money stock drops. The central bank, economists say, can augment the money stock. The loser is the individual whose money went up in flames - in other words, by analogy, someone holding illicit unaccounted cash that cannot be converted into new currency or deposited. \"There will be short run adjustment costs as the old notes are replaced by new ones, but I see no medium to long term impacts on growth, inflation or other pertinent macroeconomic variables,\" says Prof Dehejia. \"The gains will be a one-time tax on black money and a possible disincentive for future black money accumulation, in the event that there is a prospect for future demonetisations.\" He, for one, is confident this move will achieve what it needs without damaging the economy.",
        "In his first prime-time speech on a specific policy issue, the Republican leader will address the nation at 21:00 local time (01:00 GMT). He said he had reached a decision after reviewing war options with his national security team at Camp David. Mr Trump once called for a full US pullout from Afghanistan. He announced a strategic review soon after taking office in January. So what can the president do when he addresses the nation? Option 1: He could pull out all 8,400 US troops and let the Afghans get on with it. That could be popular at home and would be consistent with what Donald Trump has previously said. But it would leave a dangerous vacuum to be filled not just by Afghan rebels, but also by embryonic Islamic State affiliates which are taking hold in the east of the country. Option 2: He could pull out a large number of US troops and deploy private contractors to continue the work of advising and assisting the Afghan military, in effect outsourcing the job. That's not likely to be popular with the Afghan government, and Washington would still get the blame if things did not work out. Option 3: And this seems the more likely one. He could send more troops (up to 4,000 the best guess) to bolster the training of more Afghan security forces and perhaps add to the American special forces who are involved in the fight to expel IS related groups. Whatever he decides, analysts will be looking for something that amounts to a strategy and not just a change in tactics and that will probably have to involve drawing other countries in the region, such as Pakistan and Russia, into the discussion. He will deliver his first major national security address at a military base next to Arlington National Cemetery, where many of the 2,200 US troops who have died fighting over 16 years of war in Afghanistan are buried. Mr Trump is also expected to outline a more aggressive US counter-terrorism policy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Earlier this year, the president empowered Defence Secretary Jim Mattis to set troop levels in Afghanistan. General John Nicholson, the top US military commander in the country, has requested some 4,000 additional US forces. He told Afghan troops at a training base southeast of Kabul on Sunday: \"We are with you and we will stay with you.\" US combat operations against the Taliban officially ended in 2014, but special forces have continued to provide support to Afghan troops. Current US troop numbers in Afghanstan are about 8,400. The Afghan government continues to battle insurgency groups and controls just half of the country. Mr Trump has previously supported pulling troops out of the conflict, which began under President George W Bush in 2001 after the 911 attacks. \"I took over a mess, and we're going to make it a lot less messy,\" Mr Trump said when asked about Afghanistan earlier this month. End of Twitter post by realDonaldTrump End of Twitter post 2 by realDonaldTrump \"We're not winning,\" he told advisers in a meeting in July. His defence secretary has argued a US military presence is necessary to fight off threats from Islamist militants. Mr Mattis visited Afghanistan over the weekend, saying he was satisfied with the administration's new strategy. Former White House strategic adviser Steve Bannon had called for the withdrawal of all US forces, arguing the war was unwinnable. But he was fired by the president on Friday.",
        "Thanet District Council (TDC) was court ordered to lift a ban on live animal exports through the Port of Ramsgate. It paid more than PS5m in compensation to traders but has not submitted an insurance claim to retrieve any money. Campaigners said taxpayers had been left to foot the bill as the council missed the deadline. Ian Driver, a community campaigner and former councillor, said the figures had only just come to light after a Freedom of Information request. Mr Driver, said: \"So there you have it: a major administrative cock-up by TDC means that taxpayers have been forced to foot a PS5.1 million bill some, if not all, of which would have been covered by insurance payments had the claim been submitted in time. But it wasn't.\" TDC said the maximum payment under the policy was PS1m. A spokesman said: \"The legal claims against the council have all been settled and accounted for in previous year's budgets.\" TDC banned live animal exports in 2012 after the deaths of more than 40 sheep. The decision was overturned by the High Court in 2014 after a long legal battle. Mr Justice Birss said the council was liable to pay damages to three companies affected by the ban. Two sheep drowned at Ramsgate in September 2012 and 44 had to be destroyed as they were sick and lame. The animals were put down after the lorry carrying them was stopped at Ramsgate by animal health inspectors. In a separate incident, a loading area floor also collapsed while sheep were taken off a lorry carrying 548 animals. Six fell in the water, with four rescued by RSPCA officers while two animals drowned. The live animal export trade resumed through Ramsgate in July 2015.",
        "Darya Klishina, 25, initially escaped a blanket ban on Russia's athletes for doping by governing body the IAAF, but her eligibility was revoked following new, but unspecified, information. However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport has overturned that decision. Qualifying for the long jump takes place on Tuesday. \"I can thankfully focus my time and attention on competing tomorrow night and enjoying my Olympic experience, which I have dreamed of since I first began long jumping as a young girl,\" said Klishina on Facebook. Russian track and field athletes were banned from the Olympics following claims the country ran a state-sponsored doping programme. Klishina, 10th in the 2015 World Championships, had been cleared to compete in her first Olympics as her drugs-testing record was established in the United States, where she is based, rather than in Russia. In upholding Klishina's appeal, Cas said that her permanent residence outside Russia still applied despite the IAAF's additional information. \"We instigated a review process following new evidence presented to us,\" said the IAAF in response. \"The outcome we reached to revoke Darya Klishina's exceptional eligibility was not upheld by Cas despite the information received and she is therefore eligible to compete in Rio.\" Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",
        "Ancient cities around the shores of the Mediterranean and Adriatic are on the front line, their stone streets squeezed full of summer visitors as budget airlines and giant cruise ships unload ever-growing armies of tourists. Take the Croatian city of Dubrovnik: a perfectly preserved historical miniature, carved from honey-coloured stone set in a sea of postcard blue. Around 1,500 people live within the walls of its Old City, custodians of cultural treasures left by everyone from the Romans and the Ostrogoths to the Venetians and the Habsburgs. On a busy day three modern cruise ships, each one the size of a floating apartment building, can disgorge five or six times that number of people into the city. They join the throngs of tourists staying in local hotels and in rooms rented over the internet, in streets where almost every elegant stone house has been converted into a BB. The overall effect is Disneylandish - a sense that you meet no-one but other tourists or ice-cream sellers, tour guides, waiters, reception clerks and buskers who are there to keep the tourist wheels turning. Mark Thomas, who edits The Dubrovnik Times, explains the phenomenon like this. \"When I first got here, I'd stand back if I saw that people were taking photographs of each other. Now there are so many people that I know if I did that, I'd never get anywhere here.\" Dubrovnik has a particular problem because its ancient appeal has now been bolstered by that most modern of phenomena - the HBO mini-series. The city, unchanged for centuries, provides the main locations for Game of Thrones. Fans come on pilgrimages to visit the settings. One souvenir shop owner, who told me he doesn't watch the series himself, admitted he had Googled a couple of catchphrases to help attract customers. \"It does seem crazy,\" he admitted, \"to stand here when it's 35 degrees, shouting that'Winter is Coming'.\" Dubrovnik is not alone in struggling to balance its need for tourists' money with the need to ensure that those tourists don't end up destroying the beauty they've come to see. The tiny Italian island of Capri has warned that it could \"explode\" under the pressure of the trade that sees as many as 15,000 visitors a day travelling by boat from the mainland, to visit its once-idyllic streets and squares. One local official told The Daily Telegraph: \"You can't fit a litre-and-a-half into a litre pot.\" Florence, Barcelona and some Greek islands like Santorini have suffered too, and it was perhaps Venice which experienced the problem first. Its population has been falling since the 1950s, effectively forced out by the hordes of cruise-ship visitors. Tourism, of course, remains essentially a good thing and in the developed world we nearly all do it. It means trade and cultural exchange and it's both a symbol of rising prosperity and a generator of future wealth. Part of the \"problem\" is that travellers from traditional sources like the UK, Germany and the USA are increasingly being joined by the new middle classes of countries like Russia, China and India. Add to that the issue of security, which means that many tourists feel safer in Europe than they do in alternative destinations like Tunisia, Turkey or Egypt, and it's hard to see the numbers falling any time soon. It will fall to local governments in places like Dubrovnik and Capri and Venice to find a way of reducing those growing pressures. For now, ideas like installing turnstiles on ancient squares and pedestrian traffic lights on crowded streets may sound rather fanciful. But if that tourist tide keeps rising they might start to seem a little more tempting.",
        "Police said the man was detained as part of an ongoing investigation into the conflict in Syria. Officers from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit (SECTU) and Sussex Police are searching one residential address. The arrest is not linked to any immediate threat in the UK, police said. Crawley MP Henry Smith said police told him early this morning that a 40-year-old man had been arrested at a property thought to be in the Langley Green area of the town. He said: \"I understand he has been arrested in relation to membership of organisations which are connected with activity to the Syrian civil war.\" Mr Smith said he understood people would be concerned over news of the arrest, particularly following the death of Abdul Waheed Majeed, from Crawley, who died in a suspected suicide attack in Syria in February last year. The 41-year-old, who was born and raised in Crawley, drove a truck bomb into the gates of a prison in Aleppo. The father of three had left Britain in 2013 telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria. Mr Smith said: \"These cases are in the minority but they are very concerning and the public need to feel that they are as protected as they can be.\" A spokesperson for SECTU said the unit was committed to intervening in activities \"which cause concern to local communities.\" \"We will continue to work with our partners and local communities in order to protect them from individuals and organisations which may seek to exploit them for extremist purposes,\" the spokesperson added.

We've been a little bit inconsistent at times, but I think next season, we have players who can play at the Premiership level. I think they'll enjoy it and flourish there. The hard bit for me was getting out of this division, because it's so competitive.\" So, having justified their position as favourites by sealing the title with three games to spare, how well equipped are Hibs for their return to the big-time? BBC Sport Scotland spoke to chief executive Leeann Dempster (LD) and former players Michael Stewart (MS) and Craig Paterson (CP) to assess their prospects. LD: \"There are a lot of great things happening at the club. We have a fantastic academy with some of the best young players in Scotland coming through. We have got a great squad of players and a great management team, and we want to keep as much continuity as we can. We didn't get promoted in the last two years but we had a brilliantly solid base.\" MS: \"I don't think there needs to be a major overhaul. If you look at the quality in the side it's a vast improvement on the teams Hibs had prior to their relegation. That is borne out by the fact they have done so well against top-flight opposition in the cup competitions during their time in the Championship. There definitely needs to be more goals in the side as apart from Jason Cummings it's a bit lean and he needs more support. \"They have been linked with Liam Boyce and someone of that ilk would be a fantastic signing for Hibs. Louis Moult at Motherwell is another guy who has shown he can score in the top flight regularly. I'm sure they won't be far off the wish-list for Neil Lennon.\" CP: \"I don't see a major overhaul. I don't imagine Hibs have the kind of money to do that, but certainly you want to try and cherry-pick one or two players you think can come and make an impact in the team. They also need to fend off any interest from other sides in the good players they have there. I think Hibs have shown against the likes of Hearts [in the Scottish Cup] and Aberdeen [League Cup] that they can compete at that level and I'm sure they'll be thoroughly looking forward to doing it on a weekly basis.\" \"I'm very proud to be the manger of this club, I've really enjoyed the season, and I've had great support from people like (director of football) George Craig, (chief executive) Leeann Dempster and (chairman) Rod Petrie,\" said Lennon. \"The board have made my job a lot easier, and the support I've had throughout the city and the club has been fantastic.\" LD: \"Neil is a wonderful manager and he has done a great job. He is fantastic with the players, he has a good team behind him and he is genuinely enjoying his time here and we love having him here. It is a great partnership and long may it continue.\" MS: \"They've got a squad and a management structure there that is vastly improved on what they had when they were in the Premiership, so it would be a perverse situation if they went back to something of a lesser standing when they are in the top flight.\" CP: \"I think the biggest thing the board did was push the boat out and get Neil Lennon. He was a winner as a player, a winner as a manager, he brings a winning mentality and watching Hibs this season, I think that's filtered down to the players. \"Watching Hibs a couple of seasons ago, going late into games, you always thought they might just blow it. This season, they look comfortable, you're thinking Hibs are going to nick a goal and win the game, and that's something they've got to keep going. The manager brings that - it's important you keep him at the club. He's given them the Championship title, now you have to give him the tools to go on and take the job on in the top division.\" MS: \"If you look at the squad they've got at the moment, it's good enough to challenge for the top six and I would expect them to add to the squad they have got. So I don't see any reason why they won't target the top six and I'm pretty sure Neil Lennon wouldn't settle for anything less.\" CP: \"Hearts and Rangers went up and were immediately competitive. Hibs have got to believe they're in the same category. They're the same kind of side, they're a team who should have aspirations of competing in that top half. \"The club have spent a lot of money over the last couple of years keeping a really strong squad together. At the third time of asking they've got out of that league, but they've spent a lot of money to do it. \"They're a good team this season, they've proved in cup ties they can match teams from the top division, but like every club, they need to add a little bit of quality. Keep the good players, add in one or two areas, and I think Hibs would definitely be competitive in the top half of the Premiership.\" LD: \"We have been a Premiership club in terms of behind the scenes even though we weren't promoted in the last couple of years. But we have the certainty of promotion now and the finances that come with it. We all know how big this club is and this really is the first stage of where we need to be.\" Hibs' average league attendance this season has risen by more than 5,500; the average is 4,000 more than their last season (2013-14) in the Premiership. They have not had less than 13,000 for a Championship game this season. LD: \"Importantly, the supporters have already bought almost 8,000 season tickets even before we knew we were promoted, which is fantastic. I have to thank them for helping us - we genuinely couldn't have done it without them.\" CP: \"They've done it in the face of adversity; now the fans should be looking forward to games against Rangers, Celtic, and the derby [v Hearts] four times a season. The club have got to enthuse them. The way you do that is give them something to look forward to, and that means a team worth watching and following, and that takes a little bit of money, unfortunately.\" CP: \"I think it does. You add in another quality team who've got a support and a travelling support, that always adds something to the mix and teams will be happy to see that. But for Hibs, it's all about testing yourself, and they want to do that. They've been desperate for three seasons to get back into an arena where you can go up against the big guns and show you can do it.\" MS: \"Celtic are out there on their own at the moment but the make-up of the top six inevitably will be more competitive with Hibs in there. It's a benefit to the game in this country to have a club the size of Hibs back in the top flight. It makes it a lot more attractive for players and fans.\" CP: \"I think they'll enjoy it. People will love coming to Easter Road - a great stadium, good playing surface - but they know it's another team that's going to be very difficult to beat. \"If you're in that bottom half, you don't want quality coming up every year. They've had Hearts, Rangers, now they've got Hibs. It is difficult up there, because every time someone comes up, you know that it might just push you down into that area where you're fighting relegation yet again.\"",
        "Healthwatch England put in a Freedom of Information request and found psychiatric patients now spend six fewer days in hospital than in 2012-13. The data, from 32 mental health trusts, shows average number of \"bed days\" per patient per year has fallen by 10. Healthwatch England says some patients are being discharged too early and without enough support. Anna Bradley, chairwoman of Healthwatch England, said the findings reflect a troubling picture where patients discharged from hospital often struggle to access crisis treatment at home. \"What is particularly problematic is when people leave institutions, they cannot access the support they need in the community. We have heard of cases where people have taken their own lives. Our concern is that people are being lost between hospitals and community services.\" Latest statistics show that in recent years, the number of suicides of patients being cared for at home has been double that of inpatients. Prof Louis Appleby, chairman of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy advisory group, says the numbers represent a change in the nature of acute psychiatric care, with treatment increasingly being provided outside hospitals. While many patients prefer care at home, it can also represent a risk. \"The ideological drive towards services in the community and away from beds, can go too far. Eventually that drive crosses a line - and that line is safety. If you combine the ideological drive with pressure on resources, you have a toxic combination,\" he said. Graeme Price died after jumping from a multistorey car park in July 2013. He became ill shortly after taking on a new job and was diagnosed with depression and psychosis. He was admitted to an assessment ward at Bedford Hospital but discharged after three weeks back to the care of the crisis resolution and home treatment team. His wife, Linda, said: \"They hadn't done a formal care plan to decide what his treatment should be going forward. They just released him.\" Ten days after being discharged, while on a shopping trip with Linda and his daughter Emily, he jumped to his death. The coroner said he \"required treatment as an inpatient but no bed was available.\" South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, which was responsible for Graeme's care said: \"The circumstances surrounding Mr Price's care were thoroughly investigated, robust action was taken to address the issues identified and the learning was shared with clinical teams.\" According to the most recent report from the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, investment in the key community teams set up to replace inpatient care has fallen. Between 2010-11 and 2011-12, investment across the three priority areas - crisis resolution, early intervention and assertive outreach - fell for the first time, by PS29.3m from PS520m. Her annual report notes this is \"significant\" given \"the co-existing reduction in bed availability.\" Chris Naylor, of health think tank the King's Fund, said there is evidence that mental health is underfunded compared with physical healthcare, despite recent government promises to ensure parity of esteem. \"Mental health accounts for about 23 of the burden of disease in England, but it only receives around 11 of the funding. \"If the government is serious about putting mental health care on an equal footing with physical health, then it's going to need a really serious commitment in the next parliament.\" A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"Commissioners are expected to give a real-terms funding increase to mental health this year. \"NHS funding for mental health increased by PS300m last year.\"",
        "Hernandez, 24, has signed a three-year deal, which the Tigers have the option of extending for a further 12 months. Hull's previous record transfer outlay was the PS8m they paid Tottenham for midfielder Jake Livermore in June. They also completed the signings of midfielders Mohamed Diame from West Ham and Gaston Ramirez from Southampton. Hernandez has scored seven goals in 14 matches for Uruguay and made two appearances at the 2014 Fifa World Cup. Tigers boss Steve Bruce said: \"Abel is a fantastic signing and highlights just how far the club has come in such a short space of time. \"He is an exciting talent and, like myself, I'm sure the supporters can't wait to see him in action.\" Hernandez, who scored 14 goals in 28 appearances to help Palermo win promotion to Italy's Serie A last season, arrives following the PS12m sale of Shane Long to Southampton. His signing takes Hull's summer spending beyond PS30m. Ben Arfa, a 27-year-old France international winger, has spent the past three seasons on Tyneside, having joined the Magpies from Marseille in January 2011 following a successful loan spell. \"Hatem is a superb addition to the squad, and brings a lot of attacking flair,\" said manager Steve Bruce.

        "Using a pseudonym of His Royal Gingerness (HRG), the hacker told the BBC he wanted to highlight the website's \"vulnerability.\" It only took him a few minutes to hack into the site, he said. Norwich International Airport director Richard Pace condemned the hacking as a crime that police were investigating. HRG pointed out that while he made his attack to see if he could gain access, a more maliciously-minded intruder could have done damage. He claimed he knew of someone who had planned to plant a bomb hoax in the system over Christmas, but said he was able to prevent that from happening. While Mr Pace said the information website was not linked to the airport's operations system, he acknowledged that removing it was a serious inconvenience to passengers. He admitted malicious hackers could have planted a bomb hoax on the site. The airport's operations director promised a robust replacement site - with more secure protocols and systems - would be operational within weeks. In the meantime, passengers can get information by calling . HRG, who asked not to be identified because he fears prosecution, said he hacked the site \"to see if I could.\" \"I found I could do it and then contacted the airport to let them know,\" he said. \"It took me between two to three minutes to do this. I do this mostly to see what vulnerability there are in modern systems.\"",
        "Striker Diego Costa went off injured for Atletico early on and Barcelona capitalised as Alexis Sanchez smashed in a superb opener. Atletico came out strong in the second half as David Villa hit the post before Diego Godin headed an equaliser. Barcelona would have won the title with a win and Dani Alves went close with a fierce drive, but Atletico held on. The final whistle was greeted by wild celebrations from the Atletico players and coaching staff, while the entire Nou Camp stood to applaud Diego Simeone's side as they finally ended the Barcelona-Real Madrid duopoly in Spanish football. The draw meant Atletico finished first with 90 points, three ahead of Barcelona and Real. It completed what has been a superb season for Atletico, which has seen them take victory at city rivals Real, as well as win nine league games in succession to go top of the table in March. Their run faltered slightly towards the end, as they lost to Levante and drew at home to Malaga, but they went into the game against Barcelona knowing a point would be enough to win the title. If that gave Atletico players any psychological advantage, it was swiftly eradicated when Simeone's side lost two of their key players inside the opening 20 minutes. Their first casualty was Costa. The striker, with 27 goals in the league this season, had only just returned to the side after missing last week's draw with Malaga, and he lasted just 14 minutes before his hamstring went after a brief sprint. Costa limped off in tears and just seven minutes later it got worse for the visitors. Arda Turan, so often the creator of Atletico's better moves this season, landed on his back awkwardly when challenging for possession and he too was unable to continue. To Atletico's credit, they did not let that double blow disrupt them as they managed to keep Barcelona at arm's length, whilst also threatening occasionally themselves. Atletico's Tiago directed a header over the bar from Koke's inviting cross, before Pedro missed with a similar attempt for Barcelona soon after. There had barely been a shot on target in the first half hour but it was a moment of brilliance from Sanchez that gave Barcelona the lead. Cesc Fabregas curled a ball into the box for Lionel Messi who, with his back to goal, chested the ball into the path of an onrushing Sanchez, who smashed a first time effort from the tightest of angles just inside the top right of the Atletico goal. The half-time whistle provided Simeone the chance to offer words of encouragement to his players, and whatever he said evidently worked as the visitors made a storming start to the second half. Villa's shot on the turn struck the post, before the former Barcelona striker saw a low, left-footed effort saved by Pinto, but their pressure paid dividends just five minutes after the restart when Gabi whipped a corner into the middle of the area where Godin rose highest to send a bullet header low into the back of the net. Barcelona needed to regain the initiative if they were to successfully defend the league title and the balance of play quickly swung back in their favour, with the visitors seemingly content to soak up pressure and try and hit the hosts on the counter. Messi, quiet for large periods of the game, had the ball in the net midway through the second half, but the Argentine's effort was ruled offside, before Alves struck a shot from distance that seemed destined for the top corner, only for Atletico keeper Thibaut Courtois to react superbly to push the ball over his goal. The Atletico players held their nerve to keep Barcelona at bay in the final 10 minutes before the final whistle confirmed their status as league champions. With one trophy secured, Simeone will now switch his attention to the Champions League, with Atletico taking on Real Madrid in the final on Saturday, 24 May.",

        "There was a time when by-elections were a speciality of the Liberal Democrats. They enjoyed a string of famous by-election victories, snatching seats in Newbury, Eastleigh and Dunfermline West. Of course all that was before they went into government. In Corby they came fourth behind the UK Independence Party and lost their deposit. Their candidate, Jill Hope, admitted it was a setback but put it down to the \"hard and unpopular decisions\" the coalition government had been forced to make to tackle the economic mess it inherited. Even before the result was announced the Lib Dem President Tim Farron said his party was bound to get squeezed in a mid-term contest in a marginal seat. They did come second in the Manchester Central by-election, but their candidate Marc Ramsbottom saw a 17 swing against his party and mustered just 1,571 votes. In Cardiff, the Lib Dems came third after another slump in their vote. In the elections for Police and Crime Commissioners, in England and Wales, the party did little better. The Lib Dems came fourth behind UKIP in Wiltshire and Northumberland and fourth behind an independent in Merseyside. In South Yorkshire, Nick Clegg's backyard, the party came fifth behind both UKIP and the English Democrats. As we have reported, the turnout was very low, but Lib Dems are supposed to be good at local campaigning, getting their supporters out. Party morale has suffered another serious blow.",
        "Scott Carson was at full stretch to tip a header from Brentford's John Egan behind, while Tom Ince saw his free-kick turned over by visiting keeper Daniel Bentley. The visitors almost scored when Scott Hogan rounded Carson, but he could only find the side netting. Derby, who have just seven goals in 13 games, are three points off relegation. Johnny Russell and Ince had the Rams' best second-half chances, while Romaine Sawyers had a penalty shout waved away for Brentford. Despite the lack of goals, Steve McClaren's Derby side are now on a four-game unbeaten run, conceding just once in the process. Their lack of attacking impetus was compounded by James Wilson's knee injury in training, and they also lost Will Hughes, who limped off midway through the first half. Brentford, winless in three games, are just a point outside the top six and rarely looked in trouble against their hosts. The clean sheet was their first against Derby in 11 attempts, going back to 1953, and they have not won an away game against the Rams since 1939. Derby County manager Steve McClaren: \"The first half was too slow, no tempo and a little too safe. \"But we've got to play football with these players, they are football players, we can't play long ball. \"At times they are making mistakes but that will progress and will get better and I had no faults apart from in the final third where we needed that bit of magic. \"A draw was probably a fair result, we huffed and puffed without blowing the house down.\" Brentford head coach Dean Smith: \"I don't know if we deserved to win but we certainly deserved a penalty. \"It was a double whammy and how it's not given I don't know. I think their bench was embarrassed it wasn't given as well. \"I thought our performance was very good, very disciplined and the intensity of pressing in our half was very good. \"Derby have got very good players but had very few clear-cut chances and I think our goalkeeper was rarely troubled.

        "Scripps' channels include the Food Network and Travel Channel. The two companies are estimated to have 20 of ad-supported TV viewership in the US The two said the deal would enable them to compete better with online options. Firms such as Amazon and Netflix are increasing competition in the sector. Discovery and Scripps are also grappling with changing models of distribution, as cable companies respond to falling subscriber numbers with their own online platforms and less expensive packages with fewer channels. \"We believe that by coming together with Scripps, we will create a stronger, more flexible and more dynamic media company with a global content engine that can be fully optimised and monetised across our combined networks, products and services in every country around the world,\" said Discovery chief executive David Zaslav. The offer values Scripps stock at 90 per share, 34 higher than the price when reports of the deal first circulated earlier this month. The 14.6bn deal includes Discovery's assumption of 2.7bn in Scripps debt. The companies said they expect to make 350m in savings through the combination, which is subject to regulatory review. The deal is expected to be completed by early 2018. Discovery's channels also include Science, TurboVelocity and Eurosport. The company, which has its headquarters near Washington, DC, employed about 7,000 people at the end of 2016. Scripps, based in Tennessee, owns international ventures such as UKTV, a commercial joint venture with BBC Worldwide and TVN, a premiere multi-platform provider of entertainment, lifestyle and news content in Poland. Reports of a possible merger started circulating earlier this month, pushing up share values of both companies. Scripps shares held steady after the firms announced the deal on Monday, rising 0.7 in opening trade. Shares of Discovery, which also reported quarterly earnings, fell nearly 7. Analysts at research firm Moffett Nathanson said the deal could lead to some benefits, but was unlikely to change the long-term challenges faced by the two firms. \"While there will likely be ample cost synergies, international revenue opportunities and improved relative scale, we don't think this merger will fundamentally alter the long-term prospects of these companies.\"",
        "Mr Hockey's appointment comes after he left politics following his removal as treasurer by Malcolm Turnbull. He had been seen as a close ally of Tony Abbott who was ousted as PM by Mr Turnbull in a party vote in September. Mr Turnbull said Mr Hockey was \"a great Australian, he is one of the most engaging, persuasive people I've known in public life.\" \"He's held very high office, he's got great contacts in the United States, he's a passionate patriot,\" he told Australian media. Announcing the appointment, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australia's relationship with the United States was the \"bedrock of foreign and defence policy.\" Some in the Labor opposition questioned the move, citing Mr Turnbull's role in ousting Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey's departure from politics. \"This is a very important posting for Australia and should be done by someone with a deep interest for foreign affairs,\" said deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek. \"There is no doubt this is a captain's pick by Malcolm Turnbull,\" she told ABC television. Kim Beazley, who has has been Australia's ambassador to the United States since 2010, will be replaced by Mr Hockey in January.",
        "Craig Bryson gave the Rams an early lead when he struck from the edge of the area, before Thomas Ince curled in a stunning effort to double the lead. Shortly after Bryson hit the crossbar, Darren Bent added a third when he headed home from close range. Ipswich struggled for clear-cut chances, while Derby missed several. Ince, whose earlier effort came after he drifted in from the right to score his 11th goal of the season, could only hit the post from a low cross by Bent in the second half. Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski also made smart saves from both Bent and Jacob Butterfield. The hosts had a late penalty appeal when Grant Ward went down in the area, shortly before Kieffer Moore's shot was deflected wide on his home debut. The result leaves the hosts with just one win from their last seven games, a run which included being knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Lincoln City. There was further bad news for McCarthy's men, with influential forward Tom Lawrence replaced at half-time because of injury. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: \"It looked like an ordinary start from both teams, but the first goal was far too easy for me, as was the second. \"We'd had a bit of a rally just before the third goal, when we should have scored from a corner kick, but then we give the ball away and it ends up in the net. \"It's quite clearly a foul in the build-up, which is not irrelevant because at 2-0 we could maybe get back in it, but 3-0 has put the game to bed.\" Derby manager Steve McClaren: \"We should have scored more goals, but you can't have everything. I thought we were great in the first half - we've been so disappointed with our starts over recent games. \"There were some tremendous performances and to come here and win 3-0 means the credit has to go to the players. \"The most important thing in the second half was not to be complacent, keep a clean sheet and take home the three points.\" Match ends, Ipswich Town 0, Derby County 3.

        "But they say it is still too early to say whether it is the remains of Swedish journalist Kim Wall. She was last seen alive on 10 August as she departed on a trip with submarine inventor Peter Madsen. He initially said he had dropped her off safely near Copenhagen, but has since said she died in an accident and that he had \"buried\" her at sea. The body has been sent for DNA analysis, but the results will not be available until Thursday morning. Divers continue to search the waters near where the torso was discovered, but, despite some reported sightings, other remains have not been found. \"The current situation is that there is a torso in which arms, legs and head have been removed off as a result of deliberate cutting,\" said Jens Moller Jensen of the Copenhagen police. \"There is nothing about the length of the torso to indicate that it is not Kim Wall, but we do not yet know.\" Ms Wall, 30, was a freelance journalist who had graduated from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. She was based between New York and Beijing and had written for The Guardian and The New York Times. She was reported missing by her boyfriend after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip to research a feature about Mr Madsen and his submarine, the Nautilus. The submarine sank hours after the search for the journalist began, and Mr Madsen was charged with negligent manslaughter. Danish police believe the 40-tonne vessel was deliberately sunk by Mr Madsen, who was rescued before being arrested. The torso was found on Monday in shallows off the densely populated Danish island of Amager, on which the Danish capital of Copenhagen is partly situated. Mr Madsen denies any wrongdoing.

        "When I arrive at Lord Bannside's Belfast home, I am greeted on the doorstep by his wife, Eileen, or Baroness Paisley to use her official title. She knew I was coming and quickly ushers me into one of the front rooms where her husband is waiting. He is ready for the interview but before we begin filming there is much to see. Laid out on an impressive dining table, he has placed an array of memorabilia from the Home Rule crisis. There are antiquarian books signed by his political hero, Sir Edward Carson. There are rare cartoons from the period and framed portraits. There is also an original scrap book that details the drama and intrigue of the 1914 loyalist gun-running. Then there are the weapons - two swords - one that belonged to Fred Crawford who organised the gun running and beside it sits a dummy wooden rifle that was once carried by one of Carson's volunteers. The former first minister tells me he has had it in his possession for 50 years. His display of Home Rule exhibits would not look out of place in a museum. Lord Bannside is understandably proud of his collection and each item comes with a story of how he acquired it and who gave it to them. We begin by discussing the signing of the Ulster Covenant and what it means to him a century on. He smiles, as it is clearly a subject that he has long considered and often discussed. He tells me: \"It is a tremendous story\" and he adds that it would \"never have happened without Edward Carson.\" Throughout his political career Lord Bannside often compared himself to Carson, so I wanted to know if he believed he had always acted the way his hero would have behaved. For example, did he think Carson would have approved of a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein? \"Yes I think he would,\" he tells me. He later adds that he thinks Carson would have viewed some modern day unionists badly as they are \"weak on the preservation of the union.\" Our discussion then moves onto how the centenary of the Covenant should be marked. He hopes Saturday's parade in Belfast will pass off peacefully. He says it needs to be carefully handled, well organised and must be kept legal. I press him on whether the Orange Order should have done more to reach out to resident groups. He rejects the suggestion because he believes that the Order have done all that could be expected. He insists: \"I don't think the Orange Order is aggressively opposing and hurting people.\" He also feels that Order does not have to go and \"bend the knee\" to explain its actions. He says the Loyal Orders have the right to walk past Catholic churches and play hymns provided they are not trying to \"incite people.\" I could not end our conversation without discussing his health. Seven months after he was admitted to the Ulster Hospital with heart problems he looks healthy. I ask him how he is and he replies \"very well.\" In what appears to be a challenge he says: \"I don't look like a sick man, do I?\" Although his voice is quieter, in many ways he is like the Ian Paisley of old. He still has a good line for journalists, and like his political hero Edward Carson, he insists he will always stick to his guns.",
        "The Alex, relegated from League One, enquired about the 18-year-old but were turned down immediately. \"I spoke to (United Under-21 coach) Warren Joyce last season about taking him,\" Collins told BBC Radio Stoke. \"They said he was needed in their 21s and a week later he makes his first-team debut and the rest is history.\" Rashford's rise has been meteoric after he scored twice on his United debut in the Europa League against Midtjylland and repeated the feat in his first Premier League game against Arsenal before finishing the season with eight goals in 18 games. Called into the senior England squad, he scored less than three minutes into his first international appearance against Australia and is now in France for Euro 2016. \"It shows you there are good players in these academies,\" Collins said. \"There are plenty of kids being produced but opportunity is the key - maybe some of the bigger clubs are missing a trick.\"",
        "She made the announcement at the Dorset Rape Crisis charity screening of the show's final episode in Bridport, Dorset, on Monday evening. Hesmondhalgh said she was proud to have \"given a voice\" to rape victims in the eight-part crime serial. The charity said it was \"excited\" she had agreed to take the position. The storyline of the third and final series of Broadchurch, which is part-filmed in West Bay, centred on the rape of Trish Winterman - played by former Coronation Street actress Hesmondhalgh. Among the relationships that develop in the show is Trish's work with her rape counsellor Beth Lattimer, portrayed by Jodie Whittaker. Tracy Parsons, from Dorset Rape Crisis, which worked closely with Broadchurch's writer and producer, Chris Chibnall, said the programmes had shown there was support for people struggling with the legacy of rape. \"We are really excited that Julie has agreed to be our patron - it's huge for our trustees, staff and clients that someone who is so well known is coming onboard,\" she said. Hesmondhalgh said: \"I was very relieved that I had given a voice - in my own small way in this big project - to the people who have been through [rape].\" Of her new role as patron of Dorset Rape Crisis, she said: \"I feel very proud to be part of increasing the profile of anybody who is doing this incredible, important, essential work.\" She described rape as a \"pressing\" issue, adding: \"We need to start having conversations at home with our families - with our daughters and our sons - about consent and about respect, and about healthy, sexual relationships.\"",
        "In the space of two months, the 25-year-old has become one of the most controversial politicians in Hong Kong - and is now pitted in a court battle against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments - even though she has admitted it could bankrupt her. Ms Yau and fellow party member Sixtus Leung won elections in September, gaining more than 55,000 votes between them. Ms Yau, a daughter of two civil servants, had little previous political experience, and made headlines for edging out a veteran politician to win a seat. The Chinese Studies graduate had been involved in the 2014 pro-democracy protests, when tens of thousands of people, including large numbers of students, took to the streets demanding fully democratic elections in Hong Kong. She describes the protests as an important part of her political awakening. After the movement failed to win any concessions from Beijing, Ms Yau and Mr Leung became involved in a new political party - Youngspiration - that campaigns against mainland China's influence on Hong Kong, and advocates a \"Hong Kong first\" approach. The party struck a nerve with many young Hong Kongers unhappy with China and disillusioned with traditional pro-democracy parties, who they argue have failed to achieve any reform. But, after their election victory, things quickly spiralled out of control. Ms Yau and Mr Leung sparked a furore when they were being sworn in last month. Instead of pledging allegiance to the \"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China,\" the duo swore allegiance to the \"Hong Kong nation,\" used a term considered derogatory towards China, and displayed a banner that read \"Hong Kong is not China.\" Their oaths were invalidated, and thousands of people protested against their actions, demanding they be removed from parliament. A top Chinese official even likened the duo to \"two cancer cells - if you don't care about it, it will continue to hurt your body.\" The Hong Kong government launched a court case to disqualify them. And the Chinese government also decided to intervene - issuing a controversial interpretation of Hong Kong's law on oath taking, to say that any oath that is not \"sincere\" should be automatically disqualified. After losing the court case, Ms Yau and Mr Leung were disqualified as legislators - and are now also bombarded with angry comments on social media, where people accuse them of being useless, politically naive, or insulting their country. But for all the controversy surrounding her, Ms Yau comes across as mild-mannered and determined in person - and less slick or media trained than many other politicians. \"We know that appealing the court decision will cost a lot,\" she says. \"We may face bankruptcy, but we have no choice.\" She is concerned that if the case is not challenged, it may set a legal precedent for other pro-independence legislators to be disqualified, which would allow the government to \"negate the results of a democratic vote.\" She says she believes in independence for Hong Kong because the \"One Country, Two Systems\" model under which it is governed, after it was handed back to China from the British in 1997, is \"a failed experiment.\" Despite the model, which promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, \"in these few years we have seen the PRC [People's Republic of China] government having direct interventions into the internal affairs of Hong Kong.\" \"We have to find another way to solve this problem,\" she says. \"One solution may be independence - or maybe we can find another kind of solution, but right now I can't think of any other solutions.\" It is true that there has been growing anger in Hong Kong at perceived Chinese involvement in its affairs. In particular, the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers who published books critical of mainland China in late 2015 sparked concerns over Hong Kong's future. But a majority of people in Hong Kong do not support independence - or think that calls for independence are part of the problem, not the solution. Hong Kong relies on China for much of its food and water supplies - as well as much of its trade - and the Chinese government has shown that it has zero tolerance for moves towards independence from any of its territories. The last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, supported democratic reform in Hong Kong - but recently said that independence for Hong Kong is \"something which is not going to happen.\" He has argued that the campaign for independence \"dilutes support for democracy and makes a mockery of a serious political argument,\" and that it would be \"a tragedy\" if the \"moral high ground\" of those seeking democracy was lost. Veteran democracy activist Martin Lee has even said he felt suspicious of Ms Yau and Mr Leung's actions, saying that they are \"giving [Beijing] the excuse\" to destroy Hong Kong's judicial independence. Some have even accused Ms Yau and Mr Leung of secretly working with Beijing to undermine Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Ms Yau flatly denies this, and says her party has faced such accusations ever since it was founded. \"There are no external forces telling us what to do, to make long term plans, or betray Hong Kong.\" Looking amused, she adds: \"If we really were undercover agents, surely we'd still be in the legislative council - we wouldn't have let ourselves get kicked out, would we?\" Ms Yau is known for being outspoken. She supported gay marriage in her election campaign - despite receiving criticism for it - and also raised eyebrows when she said that Hong Kong's housing shortage meant that young people had \"no room to bang.\" But a lot of the comments about Ms Yau have focused on her gender and appearance, rather than her policies. One newspaper wrote articles about what she wore to rallies, highlighting what they called her \"protest look,\" while others nicknamed her \"goddess\" in reference to her appearance. And the sexism appears to have stepped up a notch since the oath-taking controversy. At one pro-Beijing protest, demonstrators stuck a photo of Ms Yau on a sex doll - and internet commentators have shared photos of Ms Yau's dress being hiked up during a scuffle in parliament. Ms Yau says she believes the sexist attacks are \"not because of my gender - it's because my ideology is different from theirs.\" However, experts have argued that the remarks are indicative of gender stereotyping in Hong Kong media - and worry that they could put off other women from entering politics. As for Ms Yau, she says she will continue to work to fulfil her campaign pledges - even if she loses her appeal and her seat in parliament. \"The fact is that many Hong Kongers take [independence] as an aim for the future of Hong Kong,\" and the government can't ignore those voices, she says. \"I hope in the future, Hong Kong people have the power to choose their destiny and the future they want - whatever it is they decide to choose.\" Additional reporting by BBC Chinese's Martin Yip",
        "The move is seen as vital to getting Stormont's budget on a sustainable footing. The redundancy scheme formed part of the financial package attached to the Stormont House Agreement. The Westminster government would allow the Northern Ireland Executive to borrow PS700m over four years to pay off up to 20,000 public servants. A PS200m portion would be used to cut up to 3,000 jobs in the Civil Service alone by March 2016. The agreement was signed in December but fell apart within three months over the vexed issue of welfare reform In March, Ms Villiers told an audience in Washington DC that the financial package could not go ahead without welfare reform. But by this weekend, that position was clearly no longer sustainable. The decision to grant the extra borrowing powers, while the rest of the agreement is not implemented, is simply a recognition of the perilous state of Stormont's finances. The Northern Ireland Executive is already operating a provisional or'fantasy' budget - one which assumes that welfare reform has happened when, of course, it has not. On top of this, Stormont departments have already built the savings from the redundancy scheme into their budgets for the rest of this year. If the scheme did not proceed, it increased the risk that budgets would be bust right across Stormont. The head of the Civil Service, Malcolm McKibben, expects that in this financial year the scheme will knock about PS25m off his pay bill. By next year, he said the accrued savings will be PS95m to PS100m and, in all, he expects the scheme to have paid for itself with 14 months. Those savings will start almost immediately with the first 864 civil servants due to take redundancy at the end of this month.",

        "The 80 signatories include leading figures in the Asian hospitality industry and award-winning gospel singer Rachel Kerr. The PM is expected to recommend Britain remains in a reformed EU. Remain campaigners said several Commonwealth leaders, including India's PM, had urged Britain to stay in. The 80 figures from Britain's Commonwealth community criticised Mr Cameron for a lack of ambition in his EU reform demands, which he hopes to put to the public in a referendum in June. They claimed the UK government's immigration policy discriminates against non-EU citizens. In their letter to Mr Cameron, published by the Vote Leave campaign, they say: \"As patriotic Britons of Commonwealth backgrounds, we saw the EU renegotiation as an opportunity to rediscover Britain's global vocation. \"As long as Britain's trade policy is controlled by the EU, we cannot sign bilateral free trade agreements with Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Australia, New Zealand or for that matter any other non-EU state. \"Vested interests on the Continent sustain a relatively protectionist policy. We have to apply the EU's common external tariff to exports from Commonwealth countries - hurting consumers here as well as producers there. \"At the same time, our immigration policy forces us, in effect, to turn away qualified workers from the Commonwealth so as to free up unlimited space for migrants from the EU. \"The descendants of the men who volunteered to fight for Britain in two world wars must stand aside in favour of people with no connection to the United Kingdom.\" One of the signatories, Pasha Khandaker, president of the UK Bangladesh Caterers Association UK, said the 12,000 curry houses his organisation represents \"have been struggling to recruit the talent that they need because of the difficulties associated with employing people from outside of the EU.\" \"If the UK had a fairer immigration system it would be easier for businesses to recruit skilled workers regardless of their nationality,\" he added. Other signatories include Rachel Kerr, who won a Mobo award in 2012, in the gospel music category, and Moni Verma, founder of Veetee Rice, a UK-based food business with a turnover of PS80m a year. A spokesman for Britain Stronger in Europe said: \"Several Commonwealth leaders have been very clear that Britain is stronger, safer and better off in Europe. \"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Britain is the entry point for trade right across Europe; while Australia's former deputy prime minister said the Commonwealth could never replace the trade Britain does with the EU. \"We get the best of both worlds in Europe, trading freely with the world's largest market, as well as accessing free trade deals with over 50 countries around the globe. \"While Leave campaigners may look back with rose-tinted spectacles, they have no plan for what Britain outside the EU would look like, and no guarantee that trade, jobs and prices wouldn't be hit.\" In a separate development, 63 of business people polled by the British Chambers of Commerce said David Cameron's EU negotiations would not change the way they will vote in the referendum. The internet survey of 2,133 BCC members found 60 would vote to remain, down slightly from 63 in a previous poll in September, with 30 saying they would vote to leave, a 3 increase. Those representing large firms were significantly more likely to vote'remain' than small-business people. BCC director general John Longworth said: \"Our findings suggest that for business people, this is a question of in or out - not renegotiation.\"",
        "The Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust was given the rating following an inspection by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in September. Chief Executive Heather Tierney Moore said she was \"proud\" of the progress made since its previous inspection. The trust was told to focus on issues including staff training, safety and risk assessments in mental health. The trust, which provides services in district nursing, offender health, and mental health and community services such as wellbeing, had been told it \"required improvement\" in November 2015. Ms Moore said the improved rating was \"a fantastic achievement solely down to hard work and effort\" it has put into improvements. \"This fills us with pride and shows that we are a truly compassionate organisation,\" she said. Ms Moore said a theme through the report was that patients were treated \"with dignity and respect.\" The trust said the issues highlighted were already being addressed and the relocation of Hurstwood Ward (formerly ward 22) from Burnley to Royal Blackburn Hospital has been completed. The trust was set up in 2002 and has almost 7000 staff across 400 sites. In October, a whistleblower who worked at the trust as a therapist claimed that dozens of prison inmates with serious mental health problems were being left untreated. The trust denied the claim and said severe cases were treated.",
        "The killings are thought to have taken place last year on a ranch in the western state of Michoacan last year. President Enrique Pena Nieto said he had dismissed Mr Galindo to allow for a transparent investigation. Earlier this month Mexico's National Human Rights Commission accused police of tampering with evidence. Michoacan: Mexico's failed state? One police officer and 42 suspects were killed in the raid on a ranch in Tanhuato in May last year. Officers said they had returned fire in self-defence but the high death toll aroused suspicions. The human rights commission report accused police of planting guns on some suspects and moving bodies to bolster the official version that all the deaths occurred during a gun battle. Mr Galindo and National Security Commissioner Renato Sales have denied anyone was summarily killed and insisted officers used necessary force against highly armed criminals. Police used a Black Hawk helicopter during the operation, reportedly firing some 4,000 rounds into the ranch, known as the Rancho del Sol, during the initial assault. The helicopter itself was hit by gunfire, investigators found. In its report (in Spanish; warning: contains graphic images), the CNDH asserts that: Michoacan has become one of Mexico's most violent states because of the rivalry between cartels.",

        "Media playback is not supported on this device Leicester's Selby, who beat Ding Junhui in last year's final, looked on course for a whitewash by going 8-0 ahead. Irishman O'Brien claimed the ninth and 11th to avoid becoming only the second player to exit without winning a frame, but Selby wrapped up the match. He will face either Wales' Ryan Day or China's Xiao Guodong in the next round. Selby has enjoyed a stellar season - claiming four ranking titles, including this month's China Open, though no player has followed that by winning the world title in the same season. The world number one made top breaks of 92, 77 and 66 as he began his attempt to win his third title at the Sheffield venue, which is holding the event for a 40th year. \"I'm very happy to get through and happy with the scoreline but my performance could have been better,\" Selby said. \"I was not killing enough frames off in the first visit and would have liked to have capitalised on them. \"I would like to win every tournament I play in. I am confident and I am playing well enough. \"Even if I don't play well, I have a never-say-die attitude and you have to scrape me off the table. \"I was gutted not to go 9-0 because I know the history that there has only been one whitewash here. I was devastated to go in after the first session at 8-1.\" Having made light work of O'Brien, Selby has almost a week off, returning to action next Saturday. Dubliner O'Brien came through qualifying by beating David Gilbert in a final-frame decider - the longest frame in snooker history, timed at two hours, three minutes and 41 seconds. But he struggled badly in the first-round encounter, managing a high break of just 32, although he avoided the ignominy of joining Eddie Charlton - who lost 10-0 to John Parrott in 1992 - as the only players not to win a frame at the championship. He has now lost six successive meetings against Selby, claiming just four frames in a run stretching back to 2006. \"When I won my first frame, it was good because the crowd were so supportive and willing me not to get the whitewash,\" said O'Brien. In an all-Scottish tie, qualifier Stephen Maguire claimed eight frames in a row to trounce Anthony McGill 10-2. Maguire, who has won five ranking titles, has fallen to 24th in the world but was in good scoring form, compiling breaks of 97, 66 and 60 to go through. Meanwhile, five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan was pegged back to a 5-4 lead over debutant Gary Wilson. Former taxi driver Wilson fell 5-1 behind but took the last three frames of the session, including the ninth having needed snookers.

        "Sean Buckley, 28, of Tonypandy, carried out a \"deliberate and vicious\" attack on Finley Thomas in September 2014, but claimed the boy had fallen down stairs. Finley was taken to University Hospital of Wales but died the next day. Buckley was also found guilty of child cruelty, a charge his partner Chloe Thomas, Finley's mother, had already admitted at Cardiff Crown Court. Sentencing will take place later on Thursday. Jurors were told Finley suffered \"catastrophic\" head injuries in the attack by Buckley. Doctors who examined his body found previous multiple bleeds and injuries to his head and spine, consistent with \"non-accidental injury,\" including bleeding to his eyes 72 hours before he died. Traces of cocaine and cannabis were also found in his system. Finley last saw a doctor in July 2014, around the time Thomas got together with Buckley. The court heard she was infatuated with the drug dealer and was herself hooked on illegal drugs and the tranquilliser diazepam. She denied Buckley harmed her son and told the court the toddler had a \"brilliant relationship\" with her partner who considered him \"his own.\" \"He never put his hands on me and never put his hands on Finley,\" she said. On the day Finley died, Thomas said she had left him alone with Buckley but received a call asking her to \"come back quick.\" She dialled 999 and told the operator her son had \"banged his head\" and was \"lying floppy.\" Standing close by, Buckley was heard saying \"he fell from the top of the stairs.\" Roger Thomas QC, prosecuting, showed the jury a garden chair which he said was responsible for causing significant injuries to the back of Finley's head. \"Whether he was hit with it or it was propped against a surface or wall and he was struck against it we can't say,\" he said. The court was told the chair was found near the back door in the house and the pattern on it matched two distinct lines of patterned bruising on the back of Finley's head. Speaking after the verdicts, Des Mannion, head of NSPCC Cymru, said the abuse suffered by the \"defenceless toddler\" was \"horrific.\" \"It is a sad reality that cases of abuse and neglect take place every day in homes across the country,\" he said. \"We now expect there to be a detailed case review which should provide much-needed answers into how this tragedy took place and help prevent children like Finley suffering in this way again.\" Nicola Rees, acting head of the Crown Prosecution Service Wales complex casework unit, said Buckley had \"refused to take any responsibility\" for his actions. \"A jury has now ensured that he must do so,\" she said. \"Finley's tragic death has brought grief to his family and those close to him and our thoughts and sympathies are with them.\"",

        "Labour suffered heavy losses at the hands of the SNP, with the Tories defying opinion polls to secure a House of Commons majority. In a speech in London, Mr Miliband said it was \"time for someone else\" to take over the leadership and that he was \"truly sorry\" he did not succeed. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls was among the party's big-name casualties. It also lost its election campaign chief Douglas Alexander and its leader in Scotland Jim Murphy. Mr Miliband was applauded by staff as he arrived at Labour headquarters in central London. He confirmed deputy leader Harriet Harman would be interim leader. \"I joined this party aged 17,\" he said. \"I never dreamed I'd lead it.\" He may have served in Gordon Brown's cabinet, but few people outside politics had heard of Ed Miliband before he was elected leader of the Labour Party in 2010, a post he has now relinquished in the wake of Labour's election defeat. He had spent much of the first 40 years of his life in the shadow of his older brother David, the former foreign secretary. He did the same course - Philosophy, Politics and Economics - at Oxford University, at the same college, and followed David into a similar backroom role in the Labour Party, albeit on different sides of the Tony BlairGordon Brown divide. The two even lived in neighbouring flats in the same building for a while. In full: The Ed Miliband Story He joked that he would spending his time \"reacquainting\" himself with his wife and children, thanked the public for the \"selfies\" and - in a reference to an online trend of teenage fans - \"the most unlikely cult of the 21st century - milifandom.\" Mr Miliband said he had done his best for five years, and that it was \"not simply leadership that achieves change.\" \"I will never give up on fighting for the Britain that I believe in,\" he said. He urged supporters not to \"mourn\" the defeat. \"We have come back before and this party will come back again,\" he added. Speaking earlier after retaining his Doncaster North seat, Mr Miliband said his party had been overwhelmed by a \"surge of nationalism.\" Ms Harman confirmed she would step down as deputy leader once the new leadership is in place. Labour MP Tom Watson - the party's former campaign co-ordinator - confirmed that he would consider running to replace her. \"I've always thought that the deputy leader role is the campaigning role,\" he told BBC News. \"We've got a mayoral election in Tower Hamlets to fight in six weeks' time. Who knows, we might even have a by-election for London mayor. \"So this party has got to keep campaigning whilst we try and understand what's gone on in the general election.\" Mr Balls lost his Morley and Outwood seat to Conservative candidate Andrea Jenkyns by 422 votes. \"Any personal disappointment I have at this result is as nothing compared to the sense of sorrow I have at the result Labour has achieved across the UK, and the sense of concern I have about the future,\" he said. Mr Balls said questions would arise about the future of the United Kingdom and Britain's position in Europe over the next five years. Labour also lost previous leader Gordon Brown's former constituency to the SNP as the nationalist party almost swept the board in Scotland. Mr Alexander lost his seat to a 20-year-old student after a massive 26.9 swing from Labour to the SNP in Paisley and Renfrewshire South. Conceding defeat, Mr Murphy said: \"The party that has traditionally been the tireless champion of the underdog now finds itself in the position of being the underdog. \"Scotland needs a strong Labour Party and our fight-back starts tomorrow morning.\" Former Labour Home Secretary Lord Reid told the BBC \"changing the captain\" would not necessarily improve Labour's electoral prospects. \"They (the public) thought we were on the wrong side of all the major arguments - our economic competence, on the question of creating wealth rather than just distributing wealth, on the question of immigration, on the question of reform of the public services,\" he said. Another Labour peer, former First Minister Lord McConnell, said his party had experienced a \"catastrophic night.\" \"I think the Labour strategy for this election was always going to end up in this situation,\" he said. \"The idea that we could poll between 30 and 35 and pull off a victory was not going to work.\"",

        "The sum, covering January 2013 to October 2014, included money spent on in-house staff, third party companies and advertising agencies. Some residents said this was a \"waste of money\" and the States would need to \"measure its effectiveness.\" Deputy Heidi Soulsby said when it comes to advertising \"we've got to think in a modern way - this is the digital age.\" Ms Soulsby said currently States accounts do not show what is spent on advertising and promotion. She said the States hoped to produce a set of accounts that were \"more meaningful and transparent.\" The figures, from an access to public information request, showed in-house staff costs came to just over PS397,000 for the time period. The cost of third party public relation companies was just over PS300,000 with two thirds going to tourism marketing spend and other promotional work. The total cost for advertising was just over PS1.1million, which includes legally required adverts. Nearly PS800,000 of the advertising cost was for States recruitment and advertising purposes. Guernsey's States chief executive, Paul Whitfield, said PS300,000 being spent on third party public relations firms would be subject to a States-wide procurement policy. He said civil service public relations roles could be changed to reduce costs for taxpayers. Adam Riddell, chair of the Chartered Institute of Public Relations Channel Islands, said any organisation needed to justify its spend on public relations activity, and that justification needed to be based on \"whether that spend has produced the desired outcomes.\"",
        "This will be ripe territory for both sides because they believe that is where the highest numbers of undecided voters are to be found. Morgan Brobyn, from Vote Leave, said he was looking to take advantage of the split loyalties many feel because of their previous support for remain-supporting Labour. He said: \"It is a combination of failed aspirations which they see around them and because they don't see any tangible benefit to the EU or any difference it's made to their lives. \"The level of structural funding is not enough of an incentive for them to remain.\" Lord Hain, who is running the Welsh Labour In campaign, said between a fifth and a third of voters in its heartland areas were undecided. He said: \"People are beginning to get alarmed. We are going to have to fight for a vote that people took for granted. \"There is a big section that is undecided and they will hold the key.\" It means that rock-solid Labour areas will become political battlegrounds during the next week, in marked contrast to normal elections where the results are often foregone conclusions. Unlike in a first-past-the-post general election, every vote in a referendum counts as the the entire UK. In effect, becomes one giant constituency. The Valleys feature prominently in the areas that Vote Leave will be focusing on in the final days of the campaign. As well as Merthyr Tydfil and Caerphilly, they include Port Talbot, Cardiff and Newport. In the north, extra resources will be deployed in the constituencies of Clwyd West, Aberconwy and Wrexham. Leave campaigners say their blanket leafleting approach will be replaced by more targeted door-to-door canvassing in the final days. Any undecided voters expressing some degree of sympathy for a Brexit to a Vote Leave campaigner can expect another visit on June 23rd as the campaign focuses on getting its vote out. Senior Vote Leave figures admit some of their data is too narrow but they believe they are ahead in most parts of Wales apart from Anglesey, Gwynedd, Ceredigion, Cardiff and in Newport where they say they are neck-and-neck with remain. They claim to have had up to 500 activists operating in Wales in the past week. The make-up of the teams vary. In the Vale of Glamorgan, around 80 of the local Conservative activists who campaigned for the party in the recent assembly and general elections are out campaigning for leave. The remain side is more difficult to characterise because it is made up of a number of different elements. Wales Stronger In is the umbrella organisation, but it works alongside parties like Plaid Cymru, and parallel with the much larger ground operation run by Labour. Labour has run a separate operation involving up to 1,000 people on a weekly basis, and has focused entirely on traditional voters using a combination of doorstep canvassing and town centre stalls. From here until the referendum, Labour's focus will be in the south Wales valleys and Newport, where the party admits there is plenty of heavy lifting to be done. Lord Hain believes in some areas it is developing into a head versus heart debate. He says people have begun approaching them saying their heart wants them to leave but their head is telling them to stay. And it is this remark which they are latching onto, as the leave side try to generate a sense of momentum in the final stage of the campaign.",
        "The 23-year-old, on loan from Chelsea, saved a penalty in normal time and one in a shoot-out when the Chairboys knocked Blackpool out of the EFL Trophy in January. And, with four minutes left on the clock in this game, Blackman saved Brad Potts' spot-kick to preserve a point. The first chance of the game fell to Adebayo Akinfenwa who drilled wide after 10 minutes. Midway through the first half a speculative effort from Potts grazed Blackman's crossbar. On the stroke of half-time Paris Cowan-Hall's low drive brought a smart save from visiting goalkeeper Dean Lyness. Shortly after the break a Potts effort was acrobatically clawed back from the goal-line by Blackman. Blackpool claimed the ball had crossed the line but their appeals fell on deaf ears. And Wycombe's keeper had his crowning moment in the dying stages, producing a brilliant save to deny Potts from 12 yards. Match report supplied by the Press Association.

        "The Marchwood Park and Cracknore Hard industrial estates, covering 113.73 acres, were acquired by Associated British Ports (ABP) for an undisclosed amount. Port director Nick Ridehalgh said the estates would provide \"strategic long term value\" for the company. Local councillor David Harrison called for a \"statement of intent\" from ABP. The estates are located on the western side of Southampton water, opposite the cruise terminal and Southampton Docks, and are six miles (9.5km) from the M271 motorway. The sites had been owned by Oceanic Estates for the last 15 years and and are among the largest self-contained industrial and warehouse holdings in the South East with occupiers including Ocado and Royal Mail, according to property consultants Lambert Smith Hampton. Mr Harrison, who represents Totton South and Marchwood, said: \"In the longer term, local people in Marchwood and Totton South will be particularly concerned about any change to future usage of the site. For example, any increases in traffic and more pressure on our overburdened local roads will be completely unacceptable.\" Mr Ridehalgh said: \"Our intention is to continue to develop the estates to increase the income.... and directly contribute to the economic success of the Port of Southampton and the wider region.\"",
        "With all the results now declared, Jac Larner of Cardiff University sums up the night for Wales' five main parties. WELSH LABOUR Labour have exceeded all expectations in Wales. They have outperformed every single Wales-only poll over the course of the campaign - and the exit poll - achieving their highest share of the vote in Wales since 1997. Not only did they successfully defend their 25 seats, but they gained three seats from the Conservatives, taking their total to 28 in Wales. This is their best performance in terms of seat share since 2005, and their best performance in terms of share of the Wales vote since the New Labour landslide of 1997. This extends their run of winning general elections in Wales to 26 in a row. WELSH CONSERVATIVES The Conservatives also saw their vote share increase across Wales by 6.3, but this was not enough for them to hold off Labour's surge in Wales. Early in the night they were confident about gaining seats in Bridgend, Newport West and in the north east of Wales, so a net loss of 3 seats will be a big disappointment. Historically, the Conservatives have always performed worse in Wales than in England at every election going back to 1859, and this election looks to be no different. PLAID CYMRU It was a strange night for Plaid Cymru that ended in success with the election of their youngest ever MP, Ben Lake. They increased their parliamentary representation, taking Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats, and their vote held up where they were defending the three seats won in 2015. Their group of four MPs is the party's largest Westminster cohort since the 2001 general election. Yet their vote share fell nationally by 1.7 and they lost votes in their other target seats of Ynys Mon, Llanelli and Rhondda. However, Plaid will view themselves as one of the few winners in this election on a night where smaller parties saw their vote share squeezed across the UK. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS The Liberal Democrats' torrid time at elections in Wales continues. They won their worst ever share of the vote in the party's history in Wales, and lost their solo MP Mark Williams in Ceredigion to Plaid Cymru. With only one AM in Wales, and limited representation in local government in Wales, the Liberal Democrats can no longer be considered to be a significant political player in the country. It is the first time since the founding of one of the Lib Dem's predecessor party, the Liberals, in 1859 that they will have no Westminster representation in Wales. UKIP UKIP's vote share has collapsed considerably across Wales, polling 11.6 less than 2015 after 38 constituencies had been called. Opinion polling across the campaign suggested that around two-thirds of the 2015 UKIP vote would go to the Conservatives. From the results we have seen so far, it seems that a significant proportion of these voters have voted for Labour in Wales.",
        "A total of three devices from the two companies contain cells with 4,000 milliamp-hour (mAh) capacities. That is more than a third higher than the components used in Samsung and Apple's latest flagship phones. Customer surveys have repeatedly highlighted a desire for improved battery life at the top of shopper's most wished for smartphone features. But until now, batteries of this size have been more commonly found in tablets rather than 5.5in (14cm) -screened phones. \"People are constantly engaged with their screens and the screen uses the most power,\" explained Ben Wood from the tech consultancy CCS Insight. \"And the biggest challenge right now is that people are also consuming more video content, thanks to the spread of 4G networks, meaning phone battery life is really getting hammered. \"With the bigger brands people are willing to accept some trade-offs for the phones to appear as slim and slick as possible. \"But everyone else is looking for a way of trying to differentiate their devices. And Lenovo and Acer, in particular, have an eye on the business market where employers want their workers to be available for as many hours as possible.\" China-based Lenovo says its new K80 offers up to 33 hours of talk-time and its A5000 up to 35 hours. Both figures are based on the use of a 2G network, which is less energy-intensive than a 3G or 4G connection. Taiwan's Acer has yet to provide a comparable figure for its Liquid X2, which is also unusual for supporting up to three Sim cards at once. \"Following market feedback, we know that battery life is a priority for our customers,\" ST Liew, president of Acer's smartphone business division, told the BBC. \"The 4,000mAh battery is perfect for frequent travellers as it eliminates concerns regarding power, allowing users to be constantly connected whilst on-the-go without the need to carry a charger on a daily basis.\" The firms are not the first to use bigger lithium-ion batteries to make their phones stand out. Last year Motorola developed the Moto Maxx, ahead of its takeover by Lenovo. The handset features a 3,900 mAh battery, which the company said should allow it to survive two days between charges. And earlier this month Huawei announced the P8 Max with a 4,360mAh battery - although the size of the device's 6.8in (17.3cm) display means that many people would consider it more a call-enabled tablet than a phone. Some lesser-known handset-makers have opted to fit even bigger, bulkier parts. Philips's Android-powered Xenium W6610, released last year, has a 5,300mAh cell, allowing it to endure up to three days of heavy use. And the recently-released Elephone P5000 currently claims the lead with a 5350mAh battery, which the Chinese company says is large enough to let it stretch to four days of \"continuous use.\" At a time when it has become the norm for manufacturers to build smartphones with non-removable batteries, it might be expected that those with bigger capacities would enjoy stronger sales. But one analyst said that despite what shoppers tell surveys, when it comes to buying a personal handset they tend to prioritise other issues such as photo quality, brand or cost. \"If a handset fails to last a minimum of a day then it won't sell, but once you get past that it doesn't really drive demand,\" said Tim Coulling from the market research firm Canalys. \"Most people have at least one opportunity to charge their phone within that time period and there is also a market in battery packs for power-users. \"The other thing is that the more battery life you have the more you end up using your phone anyway. It's like a pay cheque - no matter how much money you have you always spend it.\"",
        "Ben, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he disappeared on the Greek island of Kos. An \"item\" believed to have been in Ben's possession at the time was found during fresh searches. South Yorkshire Police said the current line of inquiry, that Ben was killed accidentally, was the most probable cause of the boy's disappearance. Read more about this story and others from across Sheffield and South Yorkshire The force said it remained committed to the investigation into Ben's disappearance and stressed the case remained open. Ben Needham's mother'would tear up island' in search Det Insp Jon Cousins, who is leading the inquiry, said: \"During the course of the inquiries we have made over the last 19 months, we have closed off a large number of theories about what happened to Ben, many of which have been open for over 20 years. \"My team and I know that machinery, including a large digger, was used to clear an area of land on 24 July 1991, behind the farmhouse that was being renovated by the Needhams. \"It is my professional belief that Ben Needham died as a result of an accident near to the farmhouse in Iraklis where he was last seen playing.\" The information that prompted the fresh searches was revealed to police following television appeals in May. A friend of a digger driver, who was clearing land with an excavator on the day the toddler went missing, said the man may have been responsible for Ben's death. The driver, Konstantinos Barkas, died of cancer in 2015. A team of 19 South Yorkshire Police officers, forensic specialists, an archaeologist and search and rescue personnel have spent 21 days digging near the farmhouse and a second site 750m away. Det Insp Cousins said an item, found on Saturday close to another item dated to 1991, had been shown to the Needham family. \"It is our initial understanding that this item was in Ben's possession around the time he went missing,\" he said. \"The recovery of this item, and its location, further adds to my belief that material was removed from the farmhouse on or shortly after the day that Ben disappeared.\" The Needham family, who have long believed Ben may have been abducted, have been fully informed of the force's findings. Speaking to the Daily Mirror before the police briefing, Ben's mother, Kerry Needham, said: \"They know he's dead but just can't find him. \"Police said it's time we ended our 25-year search. They are right but I can't say goodbye knowing he's still on that island somewhere. I feel physically sick. I can't feel any worse than I do.\" She said she just wanted to \"tear up\" the whole island. \"Someone knows where he is. For God's sake, help me find him. We know he's dead but we need to find him. When someone dies you find a special place.\" Det Insp Cousins said: \"Our thoughts are with the family as they are given time to digest this and they have our full and continued support. \"Our drive has always been the family, and their welfare.\" Stephen Watson, interim Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, said: \"To the fullest extent that we possibly can be, [we are convinced] that Ben died many years ago. \"Our hearts go out to the family, and as a parent I can only imagine the anguish of not knowing what has happened to your youngster. \"Every line of inquiry available to us has been pursued with the vigour that you've seen over several weeks in Kos.\"",
        "Noel Conway, who is 67 and has motor neurone disease, wants a doctor to be allowed to prescribe a lethal dose when his health deteriorates further. He said he wanted to say goodbye to loved ones \"at the right time, not to be in a zombie-like condition suffering both physically and psychologically.\" Any doctor who helped him to die would face up to 14 years in prison. Mr Conway was too weak to attend the court in person. His lawyer, Richard Gordon QC, told the High Court in London that Mr Conway faced a stark choice either to seek to bring about his own death now whilst still physically able to do so, or await death with no control over how and when it comes. Mr Gordon said the change to the law that Mr Conway wanted would apply only to adults who are terminally ill with less than six months to live and who have a settled wish to die. Mr Conway, of Shrewsbury, told the BBC: \"I will be quadriplegic. I could be virtually catatonic and conceivably be in a locked-in syndrome - that to me would be a living hell. That prospect is one I cannot accept.\" MPs reject'right to die' law British man dies at Dignitas centre Assisted dying debate: The key questions Mr Conway, a retired college lecturer, was once fit and active but motor neurone disease is gradually destroying all strength in his muscles. He cannot walk and increasingly relies on a ventilator to help him breathe. As his disease progresses, he fears becoming entombed in his body. Mr Conway is being supported by the campaign group Dignity in Dying, but the issue polarises opinion. Baroness Jane Campbell - a disability rights campaigner - says changing the law would send all the wrong signals. The last major challenge to the law was turned down by the Supreme Court three years ago. It ruled that while judges could interpret the law it was up to Parliament to decide whether to change it. In 2015 MPs rejected proposals to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, in their first vote on the issue in almost 20 years. Supporters of the current legislation say it exists to protect the weak and vulnerable from being exploited or coerced. The case is expected to take up to four days. Assisted suicide - helping or encouraging another person to kill themselves - is illegal under English law. Under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) for England and Wales, it is punishable by up to 14 year's imprisonment. In Scotland, helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution. There have been several unsuccessful attempts to change the law, as well as some high-profile cases that have challenged it. 2001: Diane Pretty, who had motor neurone disease, fought a long, and unsuccessfully, legal battle to win the right for her to end her life. She took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that her husband should be given immunity from prosecution should he help her to die. She lost and died at a hospice near her home in 2002. 2009: Debbie Purdy, who had multiple sclerosis, won a landmark ruling in 2009 when the courts agreed that it was a breach of her human rights not to know whether her husband would be prosecuted if he accompanied her to a Swiss clinic where she could end her life. That prompted Keir Starmer - the then Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales - to publish guidelines setting out what was taken into consideration when weighing up a prosecution. Debbie died in a hospice in England in 2014. 2012: Two men suffering from locked-in syndrome lost their legal fight to be helped to die. Tony Nicklinson and a man known only as Martin - both left paralysed after a stroke - had argued that doctors should be allowed to end their lives without punishment. Martin argued that the DPP policy on encouraging or assisted suicide was not clear enough for people such as carers to know how they could provide assistance without the risk of being prosecuted. Tony Nicklinson died in August 2012 after refusing food. 2016: The family of deceased locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson and paralysed road accident victim Paul Lamb lose their right-to-die challenges at the European Court of Human rights. They campaigned that disabled people should have the right to be helped to die with dignity.",
        "Sgt Mark Wright was injured in February 2012 while restraining a \"dangerously out of control\" man armed with two knives. Police were called after reports that a number of women had been assaulted at the house. They were told a woman and two children were still inside with the man. Sgt Wright was about to force entry to the house when the man emerged, armed with two knives. When the officer and a colleague tried to restrain him he was stabbed in the head. \"The cut to the back of the head cut right through the tissue around the back of my head, right down to my skull,\" Sgt Wright said. \"There were puncture wounds to my face and forehead, narrowly missing my eye.\" Although seriously wounded, Sgt Wright's actions were judged to have ensured the safety of the two young children, the woman and his two colleagues. His attacker was arrested, charged and subsequently sentenced to seven years in prison. Sgt Wright said while he was proud to have been awarded the medal, his colleagues should share the honour. \"In fairness, this is happening to police officers every day, they're facing similar dangers,\" he said. \"In receiving this award I can honestly say I am extremely proud, but I am truly humbled as well. \"I accept it not just on behalf of myself, my family and my friends, but for all my colleagues.\" Sgt Wright will receive his medal at Buckingham Palace later this year, although the date has not yet been set.",
        "He began broadcasting in the days of skiffle and was still at the microphone in the second decade of the 21st Century. Many of the most enduring acts in pop history kick-started their careers on one of his many radio shows. And, as presenter of Thank Your Lucky Stars, he introduced the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to a television audience. Brian Matthew was born in Coventry on 17 September 1928 into a musical family. His mother sang professionally while his father was the conductor of the local silver band. His radio career began when he was serving with the Army in post-war Germany where he worked as a programme presenter and newsreader on the British Forces Network, which broadcast to troops serving abroad. He also developed something of a talent for acting and on leaving the Army, he went to Rada, securing a number of roles with the Old Vic Company. It was there that he met his wife, Pamela, whom he married in 1951. There was a short time with Radio Netherlands Worldwide, the Dutch English language service, before he returned to the UK and took up a job as a milkman in his home city. Matthew was back behind a microphone in 1954 when the BBC recruited him as an announcer and producer. One of the programmes he hosted was Saturday Skiffle Club, later renamed Saturday Club, which went out on the BBC Light Programme on Saturday mornings. The BBC virtually ignored the boom in popular music in the 1950s and Matthew's show quickly found an appreciative teenage audience. Skiffle, which was based on acoustic guitars and a variety of home-made instruments including tea chests and washboards, had a fleeting moment of fame with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, before it was swept away by rock and roll. With bands such as Bill Hailey and the Comets from the US, and up-and-coming British performers like Adam Faith and the Shadows, the demand for pop music grew and Matthew's show was extended to two hours from the original 30 minutes. The programme brought a British audience the music of a host of US stars, including Gene Vincent, the Everly Brothers and Jerry Lee Lewis alongside emerging British talent. In later years the show would highlight performances by The Beatles, The Searchers and Manfred Mann. In 1960, the BBC launched a Sunday morning show called Easy Beat and Matthew was drafted in to present that as well. By now he was the authentic voice of the pop music explosion that came to dominate the 1960s. A year later his audience finally put a face to the voice when he was recruited to present ITV's new pop show, Thank Your Lucky Stars. It featured bands such as The Beatles and the Rolling Stones miming to their latest single. A guest DJ and three teenagers would also review new releases. This latter section of the show introduced Janice Nicholls whose \"Oi'll give it foive\" delivered in her strong Black Country accent, passed into folklore. By the mid-1960s, the BBC's pop offering was looking rather dated alongside the competition from a fleet of pirate radio ships scattered around the coast of the UK. When the BBC finally caught up in 1967, with the launch of Radio 1, Easy Beat was dropped. Meanwhile, Matthew, who was approaching his 40s, found himself dropped from Saturday Club in favour of former pirate DJ, Keith Skues. In 1972 Matthew narrated a 12-part documentary for Radio 2 entitled The Beatles Story which was later repeated on 6 Music. Matthew later appeared on Radio 1 presenting My Top 12, a programme on which a guest star would be interviewed about his or her career and select 12 favourite tracks to make up an imaginary album. Guests reflected the whole range of popular music and included Brian Ferry, Keith Emerson, Joni Mitchell and Neil Diamond. Matthew also presented a regular easy listening show on weekday evenings for radio and, in 1978, began hosting the Radio 2 arts show Round Midnight. In 1990, he took over Sounds of the 60s, the Radio 2 show with which he would always be indelibly linked. It gained a huge and appreciative audience of people who had been teenagers in the 1960s, as well as their children, tuning in to hear the opening bars of Foot Tapper, the Shadows recording that was the programme's theme tune. In 2008, Matthew won a Sony Gold Award \"in recognition of a truly outstanding contribution to UK radio.\" Apart from a couple of breaks because of illness, Matthew continued to present the show until, in January 2017, the BBC announced that he was standing down because of ill-health and that his place would be taken by Tony Blackburn. The Corporation found itself on the end of a backlash from loyal listeners and from Matthew himself, who attacked the BBC's handling of the matter. \"I was ready and willing and able to go back,\" he said, \"and they just said they are going to put the programme in the hands of other people. \"I enjoyed doing the show very much. I did it for 25 years. I feel very disconcerted, I must say.\" He presented his final proper show on 25 February 2017 although a repeat of an earlier programme, with new links, was broadcast on 6 March. He signed off his last broadcast in typical style. \"This is your old mate, Brian Matthew, saying that's your lot for this week. See you soon.\"",
        "The man known as Kazu, or'King Kazu' by some fans, will stay with the second division side past his 49th birthday. Kazuyoshi first played for Brazilian side Santos in 1986, so his deal will see his career span over 30 years. \"I'm thankful to the club staff and supporters who always offer me support,\" said Miura, who scored 55 goals in 89 appearances for Japan. \"I'll continue to give everything I have and strive,\" added the former Genoa and Dinamo Zagreb striker. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Miura holds the record as the oldest scorer in Japanese football - a winner in a second division match four months after his 48th birthday. He was particularly prolific in guiding Japan to the 1998 World Cup, scoring 14 goals in qualifying, and last played for the national side in 2000. His career, which started when he moved to Brazil to play youth football aged 15, is one of the longest in football history. Last week ex-England striker Teddy Sheringham registered himself as a player for Stevenage - where he is manager - at the age of 49 but opted out of playing in a local cup competition.",
        "Services were halted near Woking, Surrey, on Thursday night following a signalling problem caused by a possible attempted theft of cable. A group of passengers, including a heavily pregnant woman, said they were challenged by police at the exit. South West Trains has apologised for a string of disruptions this week. Network Rail said 60 trains out of London Waterloo were affected by the signalling fault. It said further delays were caused when passengers went on the track, meaning power to the rails had to be turned off. Emma Firth, from Farnham, who is eight months pregnant, was among the passengers who got off their train. \"Me and another man talked to each other and said:'This is our only chance, she said. \"In my condition I wasn't going to sleep overnight on a train, I had no food or drink. \"So the man gave me a piggy back off the train and helped me walk down the track. \"One guard, with a torch, helped us walk across the track safely and was very polite but the police at the gates were very angry, saying we had trespassed. \"I got home around 2300 BST. I will not be using the train tomorrow, it will be a nightmare after this. I shall be working from home.\" Another passenger, who asked only to be named as Keith, said he took the 18.33 South West Trains service from Clapham, which ground to a halt near Woking. He said the passengers, who also included a diabetic man who need insulin, decided to get off the train after about two hours. \"There were constant announcements every five minutes from the train driver saying he did not know when we would be moving. \"There was about five of us and we decided to get off. We prised the door open and jumped. \"When we got to the gates the police tried to get our names, saying we were trespassing and that South West Trains take this behaviour very seriously. \"They didn't manage to get any of our names in the end. I got home at around 23.30.\" A passenger on another train, James Bilderbeck, 39, from Basingstoke, told BBC News that the service he was on was stuck for more than four hours. \"It's a really miserable environment, stuck going nowhere. It's a distressing situation for all.\" The company director described it as the worst delay he had ever known as a commuter. Speaking at about 2330 BST, he said his train had finally got moving again and that he hoped to reach Basingstoke soon. But he said that some passengers whose final destination was Weymouth could expect for their journeys to take up to seven hours. MP for Mole Valley, Sir Paul Beresford, said: \"It seems to me as though there was lack of communication between Network Rail and South West Trains, particularly as evacuation has to be done really carefully. \"Someone should have been telling the drivers and the drivers should have been telling people. \"OK, it doesn't make them move any faster but at least it gives them an understanding of what is going wrong.\" A South West Trains spokesman apologised for the disruption, which was the latest in a series to hit passengers this week. \"A major signalling problem in the Weybridge area on Monday resulted in severe disruption,\" he said. \"A fatality at Mortlake, a line closure due to a damaged bridge and an ill passenger on a train at Earlsfield on Thursday morning resulted in many delays, cancellations and diversions. \"On Thursday evening, further signalling problems in the Waterloo and Woking areas resulted in a significant amount of delays. \"Working with Network Rail, we have endeavoured to minimise the impact of these problems, although this is of little consolation if you have been affected by one or more of these events.\" Services were running to schedule on Friday morning, but with a reduced number of carriages.",

Vice-chairman Karren Brady said the Premier League club are \"passionately committed to equality.\" She added women's football was a \"high priority on our agenda.\" Hunt had told BBC Sport West Ham should \"start to act like a 21st century club\" and claimed they had stopped his team from finding sponsors, adding the ladies were short on funds because they had to buy their own kit. In response, West Ham claimed Hunt had \"refused to align\" with their principles. The ladies' team, who this season celebrate their 25th anniversary, play in the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division. Brady added: \"The addition of the ladies into the West Ham family is the solution my board and I have long sought. \"Not only does it secure the long-term future of the ladies' side, but also guarantees current and future supporters, players and staff of the ladies' team will form an integral part of the club's bright future as we move forward.\" As part of the agreement, the West Ham Ladies' Academy will also be managed by the Premier League club.",
        "\"There's a lot going on right now,\" the singer tells us. And she's not wrong. The follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1. \"And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today,\" she adds. \"It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified.\" The singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear. Describing the concept as \"just hellish,\" she tells us: \"I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think,'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'.\" So, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later.... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart. \"In the musician's world, you say'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury.\" Her third time on Later.... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a \"genuine champion.\" \"He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why. \"I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special.\" Here the diary of Laura's day. Tour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day. \"I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big,\" she admits. \"I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up. \"Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can.\" We arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive. Laura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's \"glad you only find out on the day.\" \"I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers. \"I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album.\" Backstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn. \"There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise,\" says Laura. \"With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress. \"My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family.\" Still in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts. Running through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano. \"Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?\" she laughs. \"Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now.\" Time for some nourishment. The team there's like millions of them.... making it work are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in. \"I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine.\" Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently,\" says Laura. \"He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just.... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight. \"I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'. \"It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps.\" Minutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands. She's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved. With the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman. \"If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made,\" says Laura. There's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again. Later, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio. \"He made me cry so much,\" says Laura. \"I kept thinking,'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel. \"I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life.... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon.\" With all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two. \"It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. \" Laura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman. \"That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!\" It's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other. US outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap Because he's fine. And obviously amazing. \"I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is,\" says Laura. \"The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment. \"That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance.\" So what now? \"Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away. \"But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out. \"I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there. I can't push it back in!\" You can catch the extended edition of Later.... with Jools Holland on BBC Two on Friday 22 April at 23:15 BST or watch Tuesday night's live episode on the iPlayer now.",
        "The former Liverpool, Swansea City, Reading and Watford boss has signed a 12-month rolling contract to replace Ronny Deila, who departed the Scottish champions at the end of the season. Rodgers, 43, left Anfield in October after more than three years in charge. \"I will give everything I have and do all I can to bring our supporters exciting, entertaining and winning football,\" said the Northern Irishman. Rodgers can give Celtic hope - Sutton \"The club has been in magnificent shape in recent years and has collected silverware regularly during this time. \"My objective now, of course, is to continue this work, to keep us at the top and again make our mark in Europe.\" Speaking to the BBC earlier this week, Celtic's largest individual shareholder Dermot Desmond described Rodgers as \"a great manager,\" adding that the Scottish Premiership club had interviewed \"in excess of six\" candidates, It also emerged that Rodgers met club representatives for several hours on Wednesday. \"Brendan is a highly-sought after manager and we are pleased we have been able to bring such a high calibre individual to Celtic,\" said chief executive Peter Lawwell. \"I know Brendan feels privileged to be named Celtic manager and he will bring huge experience, knowledge and ability to the role. \"We wanted to bring one of the biggest and best names to the club to match our own aspirations and those of our supporters - we believe, in appointing Brendan, that we have done this. \"We have appointed a special manager and we are sure he can bring some special times to Celtic.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Rodgers moved into management with Watford and subsequently had a spell in charge of Reading before leading Swansea City to promotion to the Premier League. A switch to Liverpool followed and Rodgers came close to the title in 2013-2014, finishing two points behind Manchester City. However, he left Anfield without winning a trophy. Rodgers will come up against Rangers manager Mark Warburton next season, with the two men having worked together on the coaching staff at Watford. \"He's very experienced, well organised, a good motivator, a good man-manager,\" Warburton said this week. \"He's a manager of the highest quality.\" John Hartson, a former Celtic striker is also a fan of Rodgers and believes his appointment will be warmly greeted by the Celtic supporters. \"I think they've got themselves a proper manager of the highest regard,\" the former Wales international said. \"I think he'll do very, very well. It's a great opportunity for Brendan and I think the fans will embrace his appointment. \" 'Rodgers has to not pretend to reinvent football as he did at Liverpool' Former Celtic manager John Barnes is not surprised that the club have managed to lure Rodgers. \"He will not view it as a step down, despite what others will think,\" he said. \"Celtic is a huge club. They are in the Champions League and I'm sure Brendan would want to pit his wits against the big sides there. \"The fans can expect a very exciting brand of football. In terms of playing the Celtic way, they couldn't pick a better man for the job.\" BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson \"For Celtic, the most comparable spell has been Rodgers' time at Swansea - an aspirational club, with a well-defined budget, and a sense of momentum. \"The Northern Irishman embraced the club's past, but also redefined its horizons, taking them into the Premier League and then to 11th place. \"He signed shrewdly, seeking talented players who had not been coveted by larger clubs or were not yet ready for that stage, and moulding them into a side that played attractive, engaging and artful football.\" 'Rodgers' Swansea model can be a success at Celtic'",

Two cemeteries still have space, in Wolvercote and Botley, but they are expected to be full by 2018 and 2021. The council said it had not given up and was \"still exploring options.\" Linda Smith, board member for leisure, parks and sport, said the council has been \"searching for a suitable new burial site for many years.\" She added: \"But ultimately, as with new housing sites, we have run out of suitable land within Oxford. \"So far all the council-owned sites that we have identified have, following ground investigations and surveys, had to be discounted. \"Either due to the size of the site, the ground conditions, a high water table or a covenant restricting the use of the site.\" After the two remaining cemeteries are full the council said only the reopening of family plots, the use of a few reserved plots, and the interment of ashes would be possible.

        "Tomer Hemed supplied two goals and scored a third as Chris Hughton's side bounced back from defeat at Cardiff. Jamie Murphy and former City striker Sam Baldock had the Seagulls two ahead early on before Hemed latched on to Beram Kayal's ball for the third goal. Mark Little deflected the fourth into his own net, while Kieran Agard hit the crossbar with a late penalty for City. Victory for Brighton keeps them fourth in the table on an evening when the division's top four sides all won. Media playback is not supported on this device Hemed, a summer arrival from Almeria, scored his ninth league goal of the season to effectively wrap up the points on 56 minutes. He had already showed his creative side for Murphy's early finish from inside the area, and then Baldock's low drive from the edge of the box in the first half. The Israel international also went close to a second goal when he drilled a long-range shot just over the bar. On a night to forget for Lee Johnson and his side, they were denied a stoppage-time consolation from the spot when Agard could only strike the bar from 12 yards. Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: \"It was a frustrating night. We huffed and we puffed to try and blow their house down, but theirs was made of brick and ours was made of paper. \"It disappointed me that we ran out of ideas after Brighton's first goal and there are no excuses. We weren't good enough on the night. \"There is a positive in the fact that the bottom three all lost and another round of games has gone by, but we want to be looking up the table.\" Brighton manager Chris Hughton: \"I was delighted the penalty didn't go in at the end because it would have put a damper on a near-perfect team performance. \"We had to improve because the display at Cardiff wasn't good enough and Bristol have been in good form and we only won comfortably because we did everything right. \"It was as complete a performance as we have put in all season. We are not a team who scores a lot of goals so to get four was very pleasing.\"",

He is in his second season at Bristol and has scored 167 points in 28 appearances for the Championship side he joined from Ospreys in May 2014. Morgan was named Championship player of the season in his debut campaign in England. Blues head coach Danny Wilson worked with the player at Bristol and with Wales under-20s and expects Morgan to play most of the time at full-back. \"He has the ability to cover other positions but it's primarily full-back that we have recruited him for,\" said Wilson. \"It dovetails in with what Wales have done with Matthew recently. Matthew on our (artificial) surface (at the Arms Park) will be a real threat with his footwork and his ability to beat defenders.\" Morgan played 66 games for the Ospreys but found his game-time at fly-half limited by Dan Biggar and the emerging Sam Davies, prompting his move to Bristol.",

The collision forced their Ridgeback vehicle onto two wheels, before rolling into the canal, the court heard. The inquest is due to take five days. The hearing, at Salisbury Coroner's Court, resumed on Monday after being part heard in November, The servicemen were members of a police advisory team, travelling as part of a two-vehicle convoy, at the time of the crash. The vehicle, driven by LCpl Ramsden, collided with an Afghan National Police car by the Nahr-e Bughra canal. The inquest heard how the crash happened as the vehicle was travelling to a police checkpoint, at the request of the Afghan National Police. The request followed several explosions in the area. Dr John Searle, a consultant in accident reconstruction, said: It was a glancing impact, an impact where the vehicle carries on and is not stopped by the impact.\" He said visibility in the vehicle would have been similar to a car driving in normal night-time conditions. Pte Michael Peers, who managed to escape from the submerged Ridgeback, said the occupants were wearing seatbelts and opened the back hatch near the water, as was recommended. \"I heard a loud bang which was like an explosion, I do not know where it came from or where it impacted, if it did impact,\" he said. Colour Sergeant Horton, 34, was from Runcorn in Cheshire, LCpl Ramsden, 26, was from Leeds and Pte Halliday, 20, was from Wallasey in Merseyside. Pte Isaac, 20, was from the Wirral.

        "He was also being assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Post-traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder caused by witnessing or being involved in a frightening or distressing event. People naturally feel afraid when in danger, but the legacy of some traumatic events is a change in perception of fear. They may feel stressed or frightened in day-to-day life. Any traumatic event has the potential to lead to PTSD including: People will be generally affected within one month of the event. There is no blood test for PTSD, it instead relies on the judgement of a doctor speaking to their patient about their symptoms. There must have been an initial traumatic event involving a close brush with death or serious violence. There are then four criteria which must be present: \"This has to impair day-to-day function,\" said Neil Greenberg, a defence professor of mental health at the King's College London. \"With properly skilled doctors it can be very easy to diagnose, it could take a few hours,\" says Prof Greenberg. But he says doctors must have a good suspicion of PTSD before starting to diagnose someone, as patients may not bring up their trauma history. It can also be a challenge because some people deliberately \"overinflate symptoms,\" sometimes for financial reasons, while others seek to avoid the stigma of a PTSD diagnosis. For many people, the symptoms will go away within a month - but others will need psychotherapy or, if that fails, medication. Cognitive behavioural therapy can help change the way people think about the traumatic event in order to control fear and anxiety. This involves going through the event in detail with a therapist. Antidepressants, such as paroxetine, are used if psychotherapy does not work. Prof Greenberg, who also works with the UK Psychological Trauma Society, says treatment is still effective many years after the incident. However, after such a long time the symptoms are very unlikely to clear up without treatment.",
        "The origin of the giant'A' at Playhatch Roundabout on the A4155 Reading to Henley road is not yet known. The roundabout is near Sonning-on-Thames, where a red letterbox'appeared' on a bridge last year. A BBC Radio Berkshire reporter saw the'pin' and posted an image on a BBC Facebook page. \"I was just driving to Sonning to go play touch rugby on Monday night and the sign caught my eye as I went round Playhatch Roundabout,\" said reporter Catherine Bolsover. \"I asked around on Twitter but no-one knew where it had come from or who had made it. \"One suggestion was that it's linked to whoever put a postbox on Sonning Bridge.\" In response to her Facebook photograph, one person commented: \"Noticed this yesterday nearly drove on to it!\" Anita Trif, a waitress at The Crown pub nearby, said no-one knew where the sign had come from. \"I first saw it on Friday or Saturday,\" she added. \"We have all seen it but have no idea where it's come from.

        "It is a direct quote from the man himself and reads: \"I leave an institution that has the potential to reach broad audiences across the UK and abroad, through its own programmes, partnerships and online.\" It's that word \"potential\" that sticks out. What does he mean \"potential\"? He's talking about an institution that has developed - on his watch - from a well respected but modestly visited gallery in Pimlico to an international art megabrand boasting the most visited museum of modern art in the world (Tate Modern), two hugely popular regional galleries, a country-wide network of partnerships and a lending programme that sees Tate's collection of British art presented in major museums from Beijing to Boston. By most people's reckoning, Nicholas Serota has already delivered on Tate's \"potential.\" But clearly, he doesn't see it that way, which is the measure of the man and an insight into why he has made such a success of his time at Tate. He doesn't do complacency. His comment about \"potential\" reflects three aspects to his character: a predisposition not to blow his own trumpet, a relentless drive, and a challenging nature. He doesn't want the next incumbent to think he or she has an easy ride: there is work to be done. He might be leaving, but he's setting the agenda before he goes. And who might that person be to come in and realise Tate's \"potential\"? The front-runner I reckon is Maria Balshaw, who has done a splendid job as the boss of the Whitworth in Manchester, a role she's coupled with being leader of the city's cultural programme. Then there's Iwona Blazwick, the long-serving director of the Whitechapel Gallery in east London, who helped shape Tate Modern's curatorial philosophy when she was working for the gallery in the late'90s. She has long been tipped as Serota's successor, and the path from Whitechapel to Tate is the one he took. Of the internal candidates, the most obvious is Frances Morris, but she has only just taken on the job as director of Tate Modern. The recently departed Jessica Morgan could also be a contender, but again, she has barely settled into her role as the boss at the DIA Art Foundation. The search team is bound to look further afield. Klaus Biesenbach from MoMA PS1 might get a call, as could super-curator Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, and quite possibly Michael Govan of the LA County Museum. Finally, Tim Marlow from the Royal Academy and Matthew Slotover, the co-founder of Frieze, are both notable figures who could bring something new to the party.",

        "The as-yet-untitled book will appear in 2013, the 60th anniversary of the super-spy's first literary outing, in Ian Fleming's Casino Royale. Boyd has revealed that his story will mark a return to \"classic Bond\" and will be set in the late 1960s. He is the third author in recent years to be invited by the Ian Fleming estate to write an official Bond novel. Before him came American thriller writer Jeffery Deaver, who penned Carte Blanche in 2011; and Sebastian Faulks, whose Devil May Care was published to mark Ian Fleming's centenary in 2008. Deaver's book, released in May last year, is set in the present day and portrayed Bond as a Royal Naval Reserve veteran whose service included a tour of Afghanistan. It has sold over 160,000 copies to date and is out in paperback next month. Sales of Carte Blanche in its opening week were about a third of those achieved by Faulks' book in the same period. Other writers to take on Fleming's hero include John Gardner and Charlie Higson, author of the Young Bond books. Boyd said he had \"accepted at once\" when invited by the Ian Fleming estate to write the new Bond novel. \"For me the prospect appeared incredibly exciting and stimulating - a once-in-a-lifetime challenge,\" he said. \"In fact my father introduced me to the James Bond novels in the 1960s and I read them all then - From Russia with Love being my favourite.\" Boyd's novels include A Good Man in Africa (1981), which won the Whitbread First Novel Award; An Ice-Cream War (1982), shortlisted for Booker Prize; Brazzaville Beach (1990); Any Human Heart and Restless (2006). Boyd's \"fascination\" with Ian Fleming was previously seen in Any Human Heart (2002). He wrote Fleming into the narrative, making him responsible for recruiting the protagonist, Logan Mountstuart, to the Naval Intelligence Division in World War II. Boyd also points out that three of his screenplays have starred big-screen Bond actors: Sean Connery in A Good Man in Africa, Pierce Brosnan in Mr Johnson and Daniel Craig in The Trench. \"The idea that these somewhat random connections with Fleming and Bond should culminate in my writing a new James Bond novel is irresistibly appealing,\" Boyd said. \"The only thing I'm prepared to say at this stage about the novel that I will write is that it will be set in 1969.\" His most recent novel, Waiting for Sunrise, was published in the UK in February and comes out in the US later this month. \"William Boyd is a contemporary English writer whose classic novels combine literary elements with a broad appeal,\" said Corinne Turner, managing Director of Ian Fleming Publications Ltd. \"His thrillers occupy the niche that Ian Fleming would fill were he writing today and with similar style and flair. This, alongside his fascination with Fleming himself, makes him the perfect choice to take Bond back to his 1960s world.\" The new Bond novel will be published in the UK and Commonwealth in autumn 2013 by Jonathan Cape - Ian Fleming's original publisher - and simultaneously by HarperCollins Publishers in USA and Canada. Cape was also the publisher of the first ever official Bond novel following Fleming's death in 1964, when Kingsley Amis wrote Colonel Sun as Robert Markham in 1968. Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale, was published in 1953. Since then, the Bond books have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide. The 14 books, including two short story collections, will be relaunched this summer. Sales are likely to be boosted by the release, in October, of Daniel Craig's third 007 film Skyfall, which comes 50 years after the original Bond film, Dr No.",

Mr Turnbull has defended the rules, a central policy of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, by saying they are tough but save lives. In a letter to Mr Turnbull, Ms Batty said those detained in offshore centres needed care, instead of punishment. \"The centres are, by their very design, unsafe and dangerous places. These centres cannot be patched up,\" she said. The academics, meanwhile, said there was \"overwhelming\" evidence that \"repugnant acts\" including torture and abuse had been carried out the camps. This week, the Australian Broadcasting Corp aired allegations made by a Somali woman who said she was raped by two men on Nauru - and that it took police on the Pacific island four hours to respond. Is Australia's Cambodia solution'an expensive joke'? Australia's controversial asylum policy Mr Turnbull said the rape claims raised in the report were \"very alarming,\" but defended the government's stance on border security. \"The one thing we know is these policies, tough though they are, harsh though they are in many respects, actually do work, they save lives,\" Mr Turnbull said. \"We're taking a number of steps to work closely with the Nauru government to ensure the safety and the security of all the refugees living in that community.\"",
        "Because of the extraordinary C. Her life had revolved around \"her looks, men, material possessions and living the high life,\" the judgement said. She had had four marriages and several affairs and \"spent the money of her husbands and lovers recklessly before moving on when things got difficult or the money ran out.\" Last year, C had been diagnosed with breast cancer, but had refused treatment that would \"make her fat.\" A long-term relationship had broken down, she had been plunged into debt, and she had tried to kill herself by washing down paracetamol tablets with Veuve Clicquot champagne. She had later told her daughters - by whom, despite her quirks, she was held \"dear\" - she had \"royally cocked it up,\" the court heard. The suicide attempt had badly damaged her liver - but with dialysis, her prognosis would be positive. In a statement, C's daughter told the court: \"Put bluntly, her life has always revolved around her looks, men and material possessions. \"She understands that other people have failed relationships, feel sad and continue living, but for her, as she has said, she doesn't want to'live in a council flat','be poor' or'be ugly', which she equates with being old.\" Absolutely not. Assisting a suicide is a criminal offence that carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. This case is about the right of every individual who has mental capacity to refuse medical treatment. Sitting in the Court of Protection, which makes decisions on behalf of those who lack mental capacity, Mr Justice MacDonald quoted a statement of the law from an earlier case, which could not be clearer. \"An adult patient who... suffers from no mental incapacity has an absolute right to choose whether to consent to medical treatment, to refuse it or to choose one rather than another of the treatments being offered,\" it said. \"This right of choice is not limited to decisions which others might regard as sensible. \"It exists notwithstanding that the reasons for making the choice are rational, irrational, unknown or even non-existent.\" So, for example, a Jehovah's Witness who has mental capacity can refuse a life-saving blood transfusion. King's College Hospital, in south London, had applied for a ruling from the Court of Protection that C lacked the mental capacity to make decisions about the dialysis treatment. The hospital wanted to be able to treat her against her expressed wishes. The judge considered the evidence from three psychiatrists, one of whom concluded C was not able to use and weigh up information about her condition and future due to an \"underlying diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder and her current circumstances.\" Critically, he also heard from C's daughters. In a statement, one said: Recovery' to her does not just relate to her kidney function, but to regaining her'sparkle' (her expensive, material and looks-oriented social life), which she believes she is too old to regain.\" Having considered all of the evidence, the judge decided C did have mental capacity to refuse dialysis treatment. Not at all. The facts may be extraordinary, but the law is clear and unchanged by them. However, C's case reminds us of the right each person has to refuse medical treatment so long as they have mental capacity.",
        "The explosions took place at a warehouse owned by Ruihai International Logistics located in Tianjin's port area. Authorities had earlier said that the warehouse contained calcium carbide, potassium nitrate and ammonium nitrate. Calcium carbide is used in the production of PVC plastic, while the other two chemicals are used in producing fertiliser and dynamite. There were unconfirmed reports that the warehouse contained 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide, stored in wooden boxes or iron barrels. The chemical is used in the mining industry, among other uses. Police on Saturday confirmed the presence of an unspecified quantity of it near the site. People's Daily quoted firefighting officials as saying that some of these chemicals would be \"easy to explode if heated or collided.\" China is the world's largest consumer of hazardous chemicals, says Paul Pang, vice-president of industry analysis firm IHS Chemical in China. In sodium cyanide's case - yes, very. US government health experts say it can be \"rapidly fatal\" if inhaled or ingested. It is soluble in water - raising concerns in some Chinese media that it may have entered drain water - but its dust is also easy to inhale. It releases the highly poisonous gas hydrogen cyanide when dissolved or burned. Potassium nitrate can cause breathing problems and damage to kidneys, while ammonium nitrate can be toxic when burned. Calcium carbide can be harmful if touched or breathed, and doctors recommend immediately washing affected areas. One image widely circulated on the Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo, said to be from the disaster site, appeared to show a chemical burning when water was poured on it. \"With such a large fire, inevitably the plume of toxic fumes that have been dispersed could have devastating effects to the public in the future,\" says Shane O'Carroll, a chemical safety specialist with Chemstore, a British hazardous materials company. Mr O'Carroll says sodium cyanide running off into groundwater systems could pose a public health risk, and he said people in Tianjin should consider drinking only bottled water. There are standard global safety regulations for producing, transporting and storing hazardous chemicals, but these are extremely numerous and depend on the type of chemical and its toxicity. China adheres to these rules, but, Mr Pang, of IHS Chemical, says: \"The reality is that sometimes these regulations may not be strictly followed, and in some cases, the people working in this industry are not fully trained and qualified for handling hazardous materials.\" Chinese law states that businesses dealing in dangerous chemicals must store such materials at least 1km from public buildings and transport networks. But three major residential communities were located within a 1km radius of the Ruihai warehouse, said Global Times. Other media outlets also reported that a goods loader working for Ruihai claimed he had not been given relevant training. Some products, such as sodium cyanide, are extremely toxic and highly regulated, and also not easy to contain in event of a spillage. Mr Pang says: \"It is uncommon to have 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide stored in one location.\" Mr O'Carroll says all the chemicals should have been stored as far away as possible from each other. \"It is evident each should have been segregated as it was inevitable that there would be a disastrous explosion with that combination.\" Questions have been raised online over whether firefighters, who reportedly sprayed water on the initial fire before the blasts, followed the right protocol. Calcium carbide, when mixed with water, produces acetylene gas, which is flammable. Chemical safety expert David Leggett told Reuters that the acetylene explosion could have detonated the ammonium nitrate. Mr Pang says that, going by the magnitude of the blasts, the explosions were caused by chemicals such as potassium nitrate igniting. Industrial safety manuals online state that a calcium carbide fire should be put out using dry powder fire extinguishers, and cleaned up by mixing sand into the chemical. In the case of a release of sodium cyanide, for example, the United Nations recommends neutralising it with sodium hydroxide. Potassium nitrate should be picked up using equipment, say experts.",
        "Sharbat Gula, whose haunting green eyes made her famous, fled Soviet-occupied Afghanistan as a child and was pictured in 1984 in a refugee camp in Pakistan. Mrs Gula has been accused of living in Pakistan on fake identity papers and faces up to 14 years in jail. Pakistan recently launched a crackdown on fake IDs. There are strict restrictions to getting a Pakistani ID card, which is needed for opening a bank account or to buy property. Why Now?: M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad Technically, Sharbat Gula cannot deny she committed fraud. But on a humanitarian level, many believe she is just one among thousands of Afghan refugees who committed the same offence. Unfortunately for Mrs Gula, she has become the victim of a rather sudden turn in Pakistan's policy towards refugees. It wants them out of the country in the shortest possible time. Pakistan's decision has come amid its rapidly deteriorating relations with India and Afghanistan. Officials say militants have been using hideouts in refugee settlements to launch attacks in Pakistan. Another reason, according to some quarters, may be Islamabad's likely desire to inflict economic pain on Kabul for co-operating with India. The Afghans forced to go home Afghanistan's looming refugee disaster Mrs Gula was arrested in Peshawar, near the Afghan border after a two-year investigation. She allegedly applied for an identity card in April 2014, using the name Sharbat Bibi. On Sunday Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said she should be granted bail, but a judge denied her application, saying she had failed to make her case. If the fraud claims are true, she is one of thousands of Afghan refugees deploying desperate measures to avoid returning to their war-torn homeland. The celebrated \"Afghan girl\" picture was taken by photographer Steve McCurry in 1984 in a refugee camp in north-west Pakistan, during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. It led to one of the most recognisable magazine covers ever printed. He tracked her down 17 years later, living in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan. Mrs Gula later moved back to Pakistan and he kept in touch. He told BBC Newsday on Wednesday that he had hired a lawyer for her. He added that he believed the Pakistani authorities may have singled her out because she is so well known. \"Perhaps they are trying to send the message to other Afghan refugees that'we couldn't care who you are, we are going to hunt you down and drive you back into your country'.\" Recent UN figures show that Pakistan hosts 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees. A further one million unregistered refugees are believed to be in the country. Pakistan recently started cracking down on fake IDs. It has been illegal for non-Pakistanis to have IDs since they were first issued in the 1970s but the law was not enforced, says our reporter M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad. At first, the procedure was for a village council member to endorse a citizen's application. Few village councillors objected to endorsing an application for someone who, to them and to the rest of the village, was no longer a refugee but a neighbour, he adds.",
        "Laurence Shahlaei, originally from Cheltenham, took the title in Leeds from two-time title holder Hafthor Bjornsson who is also famed for his role in the popular television series. Mr Shahlaei, nicknamed \"Big Loz,\" said: \"He's a great strongman but it was my day and it felt really good to win.\" The 32-year-old is the first Englishman to win the title in 27 years. Standing at 6ft 2in (1.9m) and weighing 22 stone (145 kg), the Wiltshire-based athlete had to overcome injury last weekend to take the crown. \"I've had a rough few years with injuries and to come back and win Europe's Strongest man has just meant the world to me,\" he said. \"There's five different events that you have to do. I did a 420 kilo dead lift, which was good enough for joint second and then we did a frame carry - it's a race and you're running a 20-metre course while carrying 450 kilos, which is close to 90 stone, and I won that event.\" Competitors also had to lift a 177kg (28 stone) block above their heads \"as many times as possible\" as well as tackling the infamous Atlas stones - an event synonymous with strongman competitions. But it was running 20m (65ft) with a Volkswagen Beetle on his shoulders in around 11 seconds that clinched the title from Iceland's Hafthor Bjornsson. \"My favourite of the competition was the car walk. Imagine Fred Flintstone running in his car - that was basically me,\" he said. \"I actually broke the world record on that event. They made the car even heavier this year and I managed over a second off my world record - which was really, really good.\"",
        "The military said the driver was taken into custody after the incident near the Jewish settlement of Ofra. It brings to 41 the number of Israelis killed in knife, gun and car-ramming attacks since October 2015. Local media have named the driver as 22-year-old Malek Hamad, from the West Bank town of Silwad. Witnesses told Israeli media that the car approached a bus stop at the Ofra junction, on the Route 60 highway north-east of Ramallah, and then accelerated towards the two Israelis waiting there. Sgt Elchai Teharlev, 20, died at the scene, while the second victim, aged 19, was reportedly lightly injured and taken to hospital in Jerusalem for treatment. The Palestinian militant group, Hamas, praised what it called the \"heroic\" attack. In late 2015 and 2016, such attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs happened with near-daily frequency but the rate has dropped in recent months. At least 242 Palestinians - 162 of them attackers, Israel says - have also been killed in that period, Reuters news agency reports. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops. Israel has accused Palestinian leaders of inciting the attacks, but they have blamed frustration rooted in decades of Israeli occupation.",
        "Documents filed with US regulator said French authorities recently completed an audit of Booking.com's accounts from 2003 to 2012. The French government said Booking.com had a base in France and was obliged to pay income and value-added taxes. The company said the majority of funds being sought are penalties. \"In December 2015, the French tax authorities issued Booking.com assessments for approximately EUR356m, the majority of which would represent penalties and interest,\" the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said. The company said believed it complied with local tax law, and would contest the ruling in court if it could not reach a settlement with the French government.

        "An effort to raise cash for a role-playing video game was exposed as a fraud by users of Reddit, Something Awful and other sites. The project had 4,739 (PS2,922) in pledges out of a target of 80,000 at the point it was pulled by its creator. Kickstarter could not provide comment at this time. The site has successfully funded nearly 22,000 schemes since it was created in 2009. Mythic: The Story of Gods and Men had promised \"gameplay characteristics will be similar to that of World of Warcraft and the graphics quality should be up there with Skyrim.\" The commitment to compete on an equal footing with big budget titles and a claim that \"animations will be done via motion capture thanks to some friends at DisneyPixar\" raised suspicions. The scheme also offered supporters the chance of being motion captured so that they could appear as a \"god\" in the game, a life-sized sword and a copy of the soundtrack recorded \"at the Disney Studios\" if they gave enough money. Internet users subsequently reported that teaser screenshots had been copied from unrelated concept art and graphic design tutorial websites. No money transferred hands as Kickstarter only charges backers' credit cards if a project attracts enough support before a time limit expires. However, some users have raised concerns about whether the site was doing enough to vet applicants. \"What worried me the most is how Kickstarter allowed this to be posted in the first place,\" wrote David Kononen on the site's comments page. \"A simple Google search, and I found out for myself this was very shady.\" The person responsible for the scam may have been trying to capitalise on the success of another video game. The studio Double Fine recently raised over 3.3m from more than 87,000 backers to develop a new point-and-click adventure. That sum has since been eclipsed by Pebble, an effort to build an e-paper based watch which has raised close to 7.7m in pledges, smashing its 100,000 goal with more than a fortnight to go before its deadline.",
        "Poysden and Mellor, both 25, have committed to the Bears until at least the end of the 2018 season after five Championship games each this summer. Warwickshire chief executive Neil Snowball said: \"Josh and Alex have big futures here at Edgbaston. \"They played important roles in 2016 and proved that they can compete at the highest level of the domestic game.\" Poysden, who was already tied to Edgbaston to the end of 2017, has worked with the England Lions at the National Cricket Centre in Loughborough this autumn and is currently with the Lions squad at their training camp in Dubai. He has made 16 one-day and 19 T20 appearances for the Bears since initially joining on trial after leaving Cambridge University ahead of the 2014 season. He also made a late-season breakthrough in the County Championship this summer, taking 15 wickets in his five appearances, including a career-best 5-53 against champions Middlesex at Edgbaston. Former Staffordshire player Mellor, who first joined the Bears at the end of the 2015 season on a one-year deal, has now signed a new two-year contract. Mellor, whose late-season Championship appearances came as cover for the injured Tim Ambrose, has also played three limited-overs games. Warwickshire are still without a director of cricket following the departure of Dougie Brown in October. They have been strongly linked with a return to Edgbaston for former Bears boss Ashley Giles, who is still contracted to his current county Lancashire for another year. BBC Sport understands that negotiations remain ongoing with Lancashire over Giles, who still lives in the Midlands.

        "The Cambridge history student knew the \"significance\" of the monument but did not realise he was dangling from a war memorial, the Court of Appeal was told. Gilmour, of Billingshurst, West Sussex, was jailed for 16 months for violent disorder in July. The 21-year-old is appealing against his sentence. Judges heard Gilmour had taken LSD and valium before joining the central London protests against increased tuition fees last December. He was seen hanging from a Union flag on the Cenotaph and leaping on to the bonnet of a Jaguar - part of a royal convoy. Gilmour was previously found by a judge at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court to have thrown a rubbish bin at the vehicle. His lawyers are also challenging this ruling as part of the appeal. The crown court judge had accepted that the incident at the Cenotaph did not form part of the violent disorder, but described it as \"outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour.\" During his several-hour-long rampage, Gilmour was also found to have kicked the window of Topshop's flagship store on Oxford Street. He ended the day in possession of the leg of a mannequin. Gilmour's defence QC, David Spens, said his client did not know what the Cenotaph looked like and, as he had lived \"without a television for 10 years,\" this was \"not actually as surprising as might have been thought.\" The court heard he had turned to drink and drugs after being rejected by his biological father, the writer Heathcote Williams. Mr Spens said he had \"successfully reformed and rehabilitated himself\" and addressed the \"underlying drug and alcohol problems.\" He added: \"My submission is that this sentence was unduly harsh, unnecessarily so.\" The court has reserved judgement pending other Court of Appeal rulings relating to the August riots, which may have a bearing on Gilmour's case.",

        "In 2014, 27 motorcyclists were killed and the number of serious injuries also rose from 507 to 514 in the year up to September 2015. London Assembly's Transport Committee said the figure for deaths was \"unacceptably high.\" TfL said more police have been deployed in accident hotspots and it is focusing on motorcycle and scooter safety. The figures were released as the London Assembly committee published its report 'Easy Rider: Improving motorcycle safety on London roads'. Researchers spoke to 1,200 riders and found one in five had been involved in a collision and about 62 motorcyclists had been involved in a near-miss incident. In 2010, 4,337 motorcyclists were injured in London, which by 2014 rose to 5,233, an increase of nearly 21. The report found the inconsistency over access to bus lanes causes \"unnecessary confusion\" as TfL allows motorcyclists to ride in bus lanes on the roads it manages, while many boroughs do not. It also asked TfL to monitor the impact of dedicated Cycle Superhighways on the road space shared by other traffic. The report also called on authorities to educate young riders. Valerie Shawcross, chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee, said: \"Arguably motorcyclists have been overlooked in public discussion about road safety in recent years. \"However, 36 motorcyclists were killed on London's roads last year, a death toll that is unacceptably high, and part of a bigger picture of collisions and injuries affecting motorcyclists, many of them life-changing in their seriousness.\" TfL said that since September police had stopped 5,389 riders, issued 742 traffic offence reports, 1,335 verbal warnings, seized 96 motorcycles and made 10 arrests. Police will also target the boroughs where motorcyclists are at greatest risk of injury. Leon Daniels, TfL's managing director of surface transport, said: \"On-street education and enforcement, substantial investment in improving rider skills and guidance to help engineers design roads so that they are safer for riders, all form part of a concerted effort to improve road safety in the capital.\"",

Elsewhere, raised levels of Escheria coli (E.coli) bacteria have been identified in Oitir Mhor Bay. It follows the discovery of raised levels at Kerrera West, Loch Craignish, Kilfinichen Bay and Castle Stalker. They were discovered by the council's environmental health team as part of their work to maintain the quality of shellfish. Potential raised levels of E.coli were also found at Dunstaffnage, Kerrera East, Loch na Cille and Loch Riddon. A council spokesman said: \"Eating shellfish such as cockles, mussels, oysters and razor fish from affected areas can pose a risk to human health. \"Notices to warn the public and casual gatherers have been posted along the shore. Commercial shellfish harvesters in these areas have been contacted by the council and steps taken to postpone harvesting until bacterial levels subside. \"People are advised to avoid eating shellfish from these areas until further notice as a precaution.

        "The grimsel car took only 1.513 seconds to reach 100kph (62mph) - slashing about a quarter of a second off the previous record time. So far, no petrol-powered production car has managed to hit the same speed in a comparable time. The grimsel needed only 30m (98ft) of track to reach the landmark speed. The previous record of 0-100kph in 1.779 seconds was set by a team from the University of Stuttgart last year. By comparison, the fastest production vehicle, the Porsche 918 Spyder hybrid, takes 2.2 seconds to reach the same speed. The car has been built and refined over the last year by 30 students studying at ETH Zurich (ETZ) and Lucerne's University of Applied Sciences and Arts. Almost all of car's parts have been custom built apart from its tyres, battery cells and the motor control units. In a statement, ETZ said the four-wheel drive system used by the grimsel was key to its swift acceleration. A powerful motor is mounted on each wheel and the car has a sophisticated traction control system that adjusts the performance of each one to maximise torque. The lightning-fast car weighs only 168kg (370lb) thanks to widespread use of carbon fibre in its construction. The record was set on a race track on the Dubendorf air base near Zurich.

He said some of the cases being investigated had come from information supplied by forces across the UK to Operation Hydrant, set up in 2014 to oversee investigations into historical child sex abuse concerning prominent people. \"We are working closely with the Football Association to ensure the response to this significant and growing number of victims, at all levels of football, is co-ordinated effectively,\" he added. \"We continue to encourage those who have been the victim of child sexual abuse to report it, regardless of how long ago the abuse may have taken place.\" He said all reports would be treated \"sensitively and seriously.\" The former Newcastle United footballer David Eatock has become the latest to say he was abused by coach George Ormond. He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show he had been groomed by Ormond, later to be jailed for six years, between the ages of 18 and 21. Mr Eatock, now 40, was not part of the court case that saw Ormond convicted in 2002 of assaulting seven boys, but he has now filed a complaint to police. Northumbria Police said it had launched Operation Tide into non-recent child abuse at Newcastle United. The force said it had received \"a number of reports\" and club officials have met police. New England football manager Gareth Southgate said a former teammate was among those to have spoken of abuse. At his first news conference as England manager, Southgate revealed he had played alongside one of the footballers who has spoken out about being sexually abused in their youth - although he did not identify him. Asked if he had been aware of any abuse going on, he said: \"The reality of that, as they have said, is that they [abuse victims] haven't felt able to speak about that until this moment, and that's completely understandable.\" There had been \"enormous strides\" made in protecting young players, he told reporters.

Just 0.5 of doping tests at the 2011 Worlds in Daegu, South Korea - where every athlete was tested - were positive. In Qatar for the Pan-Arab Games, the figure rose to 3.6. \"The study shows that biological tests of blood and urine reveal only a fraction of doping cases,\" said Harvard medical professor Harrison Pope. \"This is likely due to the fact that athletes have found numerous ways not to be caught during tests.\" The research was carried out by Germany's University of Tuebingen and Harvard Medical School in 2011. However, the team claimed the publication of their work had been delayed by talks with Wada and athletics' governing body the IAAF over how it should be published. Doping has overshadowed athletics in recent years following an investigation into a state-sponsored Russian doping programme which led to the country's track and field team being banned from the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Russian athletes taking part in the World Championships in London earlier this month were only allowed to compete as neutrals.

Sixth in Athens in 2004, they finished fourth at both Beijing 2008 and London 2012. Now they are poised to go one better, sitting a comfortable third in the medal table in Rio. But the Rio performance is particularly astonishing given the country's recent history, with an economic crisis, war in the east and the loss of their main training centre in Crimea after the region was taken over by Russia. The country's President, Petro Poroshenko, has described the performance of the Ukrainian Paralympians as \"incredible,\" adding that the athletes prove \"that the impossible is possible.\" Ukraine's own Paralympic chief, Valeriy Sushkevych, is the man credited with much of the success, in particular a programme he developed called Invasport. Invasport works by having schools and facilities dedicated to Paralympic sports in every oblast (region) of Ukraine. \"In Ukraine we have set up the best system of physical education, sport and rehabilitation for people with disability,\" Mr Sushkevych told the BBC. \"There is infrastructure in all regions of Ukraine, with schools for children with disabilities.

And these people are extremely dedicated.\" Mr Sushkevych, who himself had polio as a child and who has spent most of his life using a wheelchair for mobility, says the system emphasises rehabilitation for all disabled children who enter it - but promises much more for those who appear promising at sport. \"We invite people for rehabilitation, and amongst those 100 who come, we find maybe five who are good at swimming, or football or athletics,\" he explains. \"We have to give them opportunity to realise their own potential.\" The way that Invasport works means that facilities and recruitment are spread out through the country, rather than concentrated in one area. As Mr Sushkevych told the BBC, this meant that Ukraine's Paralympians were able to come even when the main training base, the Yevpatoria facility in Crimea, was taken over by Russia in 2014. \"We had to find other options for athletes to train - and I have to say that those were not the best conditions,\" he said. \"But we had to adjust to those conditions, and even had to train in old post-Soviet facilities. Experience, knowledge and huge professionalism of the team made this result possible.\" The pay-off has been an extraordinary 72 medals at the time of writing - some 42 of which are in the pool. Powerlifter Lidiya Solovyova, who has won a gold medal, says that her main motivation to succeed is the fact that Ukraine does not offer many opportunities to people with disabilities outside of sport. For many, it is quite literally sink or swim. \"This is my main job,\" she explains. \"In our country it is very difficult to find a job for people with disability.... Paralympic sport is my main income. I live off it.\" After the loss of the Yevpatoria camp, she has been training at her hotel - which she acknowledges may have affected some of her teammates and prevented them from achieving even more. \"The camp was specifically designed for athletes with disability, all facilities,\" says Solovyova, who has dwarfism. \"!We felt like home over there and at the hotel we were like guests. For me it was OK, I don't know about others.\" Mr Sushkevych says he agrees that - not least because of the war - the level of preparation was \"not the highest possible.\" \"The world sees the successful side of my team, what has been achieved - but no-one sees what has not been achieved,\" he says. \"I can definitely tell you that we could have performed better if there was no war in Ukraine. And the aim for my whole team in the Ukrainian Paralympics movement is to show the best possible as it is so important for my country.\"",
        "Combined takings from streaming, downloads, physical sales and licensing for use in films, TV and computer games rose 5.1 to PS926m. The main contributor to growth was streaming, but vinyl revenues rose by more than two thirds. However, more revenues could be generated by platforms such as Youtube, the BPI said. Revenue from physical formats dipped below PS300m last year, but remained just above the PS274m generated by streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer. Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the Brit Awards, said the increase in revenues was encouraging, as more and more consumers enjoyed the benefits of subscribing to a streaming service or rediscovered the joys of vinyl. \"Britain's world-leading music sector has the potential for sustained growth in the years ahead, but this exciting future can only be realised if government makes creative businesses a priority post-Brexit,\" he added. UK artists needed to be able to tour freely in EU markets, and UK businesses needed to be able to employ the best talent, Mr Taylor argued. He added that strong intellectual property protections would need to be included in trade talks with third party countries. An International Trade spokeswoman said: \"Music is one of our most important exports and trade policy has a key role in supporting growth in this market. \"We will in due course explore all options in the design of future trade agreements, including the role of intellectual property rights in boosting UK exports in overseas markets.\" Streaming revenues jumped more than 60 in 2016, and accounted for close to a third of label revenues. The BPI said streaming would overtake revenues from physical sales in 2017. However, the association added that there was a \"growing mismatch between the huge value that certain digital platforms, such as YouTube, extract from music or other entertainment and the relatively small amount they return back to the creators concerned.\" A YouTube spokesperson said it was working \"with the music industry to bring more money to artists, labels and publishers.\" She said that YouTube had paid out more than 1bn to the music industry globally from advertising in the past year. \"YouTube is contributing a meaningful and growing revenue stream for the industry.\" However, many argue that the Google-owned video site should pay out far more revenue to artists and songwriters.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device Three people who know Armstrong well gave their thoughts. The wife of former professional road cyclist Frankie Andreu, she claimed, long before his public confession, that Armstrong took banned substances and bullied team-mates. \"When the going gets tough, he turns on the charm. He thinks if he can show he's a changed man it might benefit him. The problem with that is that he has no credibility. His actions speak louder than his words.\" Andreu believes there should be no way back into cycling for Armstrong. \"He should forget it. He's not going back into sport. He should go and enjoy something else, enjoy his family. Everyone deserves a second chance, but how many does he want? What is he? A cat.\" The Sunday Times journalist first raised questions about Armstrong in 1999. He wrote LA Confidential, a book containing evidence that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. \"When I see an interview like he's just done with Dan Roan, I just feel this guy hasn't changed one iota. When he's saying everyone was doing it (doping), he's being so unfair to the people who rode the 1999 Tour de France and tours over the following years clean - and plenty did.\" Walsh believes Armstrong is struggling with being out of the limelight. \"This is a guy who would get called up by he president of the United States and asked to go on a mountain bike ride, this is a guy who had direct access to people like Bill Clinton and John Kerry.... Bono was a big mate of his. Now, no-one really wants to be associated with him - and that's tough if you were once in the place that Lance Armstrong was in.\" A former French road cyclist, his career effectively ended when he spoke out against doping in the 1990s. \"The fact that he says that he doesn't regret it and that if he went back to the same time, he'd do it again.... I think that shows an honesty.\" Bassons, who clashed with Armstrong after making his doping claims, also thinks the American has changed - or been changed. \"When I saw him last year, it wasn't the Armstrong that I knew in the'90s any more. Back then, he was strong, he was hard, he would stare you in the eyes, he was brutal, he was strong and he would never make a mistake. But when I saw him last year, he was alone, he was badly dressed, he avoided eye contact, he didn't seem happy.\"",
        "It may seem strange to measure the impact of a presidential visit to the EU institutions and Nato simply in terms of faux-pas avoided and false steps not taken but somehow that's the way it is for Mr Trump. The 45th President of the United States found himself immersed for the first time and at first hand in the complexities of the EU. And he discovered that they have sprinkled the title of president rather liberally among the heads of the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament. Even with all those presidential figures on hand in Brussels, it was hard to ignore the feeling that, as European leaders were getting to know the president they must now deal with, they were being offered a tantalising glimpse of the president they preferred. Whether by coincidence or not, Barack Obama was appearing at around the same time 700km (435 miles) down the road at a huge public event in Berlin. Mr Obama had an easier day of it than Mr Trump. He basked in the admiration of a huge crowd at the Brandenburg Gate alongside Chancellor Angela Merkel where they had gathered for a celebration of the strength of the Evangelical Church. Mrs Merkel, said Mr Obama, had done great things for Germany and the world - and it may well be the case that his endorsement will still carry a little weight as the chancellor faces elections later in the year. At around the same time Mr Trump was holding talks with those various European presidents - including Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission, who once talked of the need to educate Mr Trump about \"the world he does not know.\" No-one took questions after the meeting. Mr Trump said nothing at all and Donald Tusk from the EU Council confined himself to an on-camera statement in which he alluded to one or two areas where it would be hard to disagree - like the importance of fighting terrorism and shared values like freedom and human dignity - but then said enough to suggest that there were plenty of areas where they had not found it hard to disagree. \"Some issues,\" he said, \"remain open like climate and trade. And I'm not 100 sure we can say today that we have a common position, a common opinion about Russia.\" Mr Trump's schedule appeared to have been designed to minimise opportunities for press scrutiny, so there was no chance to ask him directly whether he had changed his views on Brexit, which is viewed as a catastrophe in Brussels but which he has described as both \"great\" and \"fantastic.\" A news conference would also have presented the president with an opportunity to examine his evolving attitude towards Nato which he has variously described both as \"obsolete\" and \"no longer obsolete.\" In the absence of such scrutiny, some reporters devoted themselves to microscopic observation of the Trump body language. Anyone who followed the discussions during the Middle Eastern section of the tour about whether the first couple were holding hands as they walked in public might care to note that, as they waited at the US embassy residence to greet their lunch guest Emmanuel Macron, they did not stand hand-in-hand but were so close together that their arms were touching. The rather awkward presidential handshake with Mr Macron is a good example of how that kind of scrutiny works. It lasted only a little more than five seconds. While it did look rather over-extended, some reporters spoke of \"knuckles whitening\" and of \"faces tightened\" and one even described it as \"screw-you in handshake form.\" Watch the video above and judge for yourselves. When President Trump did finally speak in public towards the end of his day in Brussels, it was worth waiting for. He made a short speech at the magnificent new Nato headquarters building and pointed out rather archly that he had avoided asking how much the palatial new building had cost, even though the alliance's over-reliance on American guns and money is one of his favourite diplomatic themes. But he did not confine himself to that little joke on the subject. In a blunt address, he said directly that 23 of the 28 Nato members were not paying their fair share towards its costs and warned that was unfair to the American taxpayer - a remark that will surely resonate back home. He also conflated very directly the problem of terrorism with the issue of immigration in a way that very few of his fellow Nato leaders would endorse, but which picked up on one of his favourite campaign themes from last year. Here again, though, it seems that Mr Trump's visit may be remembered not for the big politics or the strategic thought but for another curious moment captured on camera and instantly transmitted by social media. As the leaders began to group themselves for the formal summit photograph, Mr Trump appeared to emerge from the back of the pack and firmly push out of the way Dusko Markovic, the prime minister of Montenegro - which is about to join the alliance. The American leader is then seen to draw himself to his full height, ready for the picture. So, certainly no diplomatic disasters on President Trump's first visit to Brussels. He came to give his fellow Nato leaders something to think about and so he did. But something about the president somehow means that he can't help giving everyone something to talk about at the same time.",
        "The watchdog's annual report on education standards says about a third of secondary schools in the North and Midlands are not good enough. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw says more attention must be focused on regions where too many schools are \"languishing in mediocrity.\" Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said more needed to be done to \"tackle pockets of underperformance.\" The chief inspector of schools warns of schools in some cities in the North and Midlands that have \"failed miserably year after year after year.\" Ofsted annual report 2015 Sir Michael named 16 weak local authorities - where less than 60 of children attend good or outstanding schools and have below average \"attainment and progress\" at GCSE - with 13 in the North and Midlands. They are Barnsley, Blackpool, Bradford, Derbyshire, Doncaster, Hartlepool, Knowsley, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Oldham, Salford, St Helens and Stoke on Trent. The other three are the Isle of Wight, Swindon and South Gloucestershire. In Bradford, Sir Michael said the problems were so serious that he wanted a commission of inquiry and a separate commissioner for education. And he warned that poor education meant that young people could be alienated and the \"dangers of being alienated from British society are very great indeed.\" Increasing attention is being paid to the geography of school underachievement - such as in coastal areas and regional differences. And the report highlights concerns about a north-south gap - with stronger GCSE results in London and the South and weaker results in parts of the North and Midlands. \"This gap is a worrying one. We don't want to see a divided country after the age of 11,\" Sir Michael said. More than 400,000 pupils in the North and Midlands go to a school that is \"less than good,\" and the Ofsted chief said this could not be \"explained away\" by higher levels of deprivation. Primary schools were much more successful than secondary, Sir Michael said, despite facing similar problems of social disadvantage. He also used the example of London to show how deprivation need not be inevitably linked to lower results. Sir Michael called for greater \"political will\" and more attention to improve the quality of teaching. \"We've seen a significant difference in the quality of teaching between the South and the Midlands and the North, a significant difference in terms of the quality of leadership.... and we need to worry about this as a nation,\" he said. \"The mediocrity in secondary performance should be a national concern - and the mediocrity is residing mainly, but not exclusively, in the Midlands and north of England. \"If the'northern powerhouse' is going to mean something, then we've got to improve educational performance in our secondary schools north of the Wash.\" Sir Michael also warned that problems were being exacerbated by difficulties in recruiting teachers - and that schools in challenging areas could have the toughest time finding enough teachers in some subjects. Recruitment problems were having a \"significant impact,\" said the Ofsted chief. Watchsted, a website that gathers inspections data, ranks local authorities in terms of the proportion of schools rated as \"outstanding\" or \"good.\" The bottom 10 at secondary school level includes northern authorities such as Knowsley, Bradford, Oldham, Blackpool and Doncaster - but also the Isle of Wight and Cambridgeshire. Eight out of the top 10 authorities at secondary level are in London or the South East. \"More and more we are seeing that schools facing the biggest challenges are now in coastal and market towns, rather than large cities. And children from low income families have the greatest barriers,\" said James Westhead, executive director of Teach First. Most secondary schools in England now have academy status - but the annual report says that in terms of raising standards \"structural reform can only do so much.\" And it highlights that being an academy does not \"insulate\" schools from decline, with 99 academies that had been good or outstanding being regraded as less than good. Roy Perry, chairman of the children and young people board at the Local Government Association, said ranking councils by school results \"disguises the fact that over 60 of secondary schools are now academies, leaving councils powerless to intervene early and build an improvement programme.\" \"It is extremely worrying that over the last three years only 37 of secondary schools have actually improved their Ofsted rating after becoming academies.\" The Ofsted report also highlights that pupils' progress up to the end of primary is too often not sustained when they move to secondary. This was revealed last month in an analysis of this summer's GCSE results, by education data company, SchoolDash. This mapped the growing north-south divide at GCSE level, but also showed there was much less of a gap in primary school. Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman linked the north-south gap to the \"very serious difficulties\" that schools faced in recruiting teachers. Mr Lightman, head of the ASCL head teachers' union, said schools in challenging areas were finding it \"incredibly hard\" to find teachers in some shortage subjects, particularly affecting schools in some parts of the North. Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the gap between primary and secondary performance had been \"driven by the turmoil at secondary compared to primary,\" such as the upheavals in exams and curriculum. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: \"More needs to be done to deliver educational excellence everywhere.\" \"That's why we are introducing new measures to transform failing and coasting schools, funding the best academy chains to share excellence in struggling regions in the North and creating a National Teaching Service - sending some of our best teachers to the areas that need them most.\"",

        "The boy had lived with the twin in his stomach his whole life, but went to hospital after complaining of pain. His mother told Bernama the foetus \"was formed with organs like those of a baby.\" It is believed to be the first reported case of the condition, known medically as \"fetus in fetu,\" in Malaysia. The boy's mother, 38, said funeral rites had been performed on the foetus and it was buried at a local cemetery. Reports said the foetus had legs, hands and genitals. \"Only the nose and mouth were not complete,\" she said, saying she had accepted his fate. The teenager had been admitted to a local district hospital before being referred to the Sultan Abdul Hamid Hospital in Kedah for the operation to remove the twin. The hospital and Malaysia's government health officials would not comment on the case to the BBC. What is fetus in fetu? Dr S Raman, obstetrics and gynaecology specialist at Pantai Hospital in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, told the BBC it is when an \"additional twin gets absorbed into the body of the living twin.\" \"It's almost like a vanishing twin, or sometimes called a parasitic twin,\" he said. \"I have actually seen a case of the foetus being attached to the outside of the living twin, so it's possible for the twin to be both inside or outside the body.\" There have also been cases of two twins found inside the abdomen of one child, in the case of a triplet pregnancy. What causes it? There is no known trigger, but it occurs in the early stages of development when one foetus wraps around the other. The enveloped twin then does not fully form but becomes a \"parasite,\" relying on their host twin for their survival. Such twins usually die before birth. The abnormality is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births. Is it unusual to live so long with the twin? One widely reported case was of a 36-year-old man in India whose tumour had grown so big that he was having difficulty breathing. In villages or smaller towns where access to medical facilities are limited, it is possible for someone to not know they have a foetus and live with it their entire life, says Dr Raman. The abnormality is easily spotted if a baby undergoes an ultrasound or CT scan, and there have been cases of babies as young as three months old being operated on.",
        "Connor Smith, 19, \"turned\" on work colleague Anil Jnagal during a night out on Birmingham's Broad Street, the city's crown court heard. He was drunk and had cannabis before attacking Mr Jnagal, who had been trying to calm him down. Smith admitted wounding and his barrister said he was remorseful but added \"nothing is going to bring the complainant's ear back.\" More updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country Prosecutor Tariq Shakoor said Smith, of Summerlee Road, worked with Mr Jnagal, 25, at a branch of Harvester in Birmingham's Star City leisure complex. He told the court the victim remembered Smith \"turning on him\" and the pair fell to the floor, where the defendant bit his ear. The court heard reconstructive surgery was unlikely due to the nature of the injury. Jonathan Barker, defending, said Smith was in an emotional state at the time of the attack due to the recent death of his aunt. Sentencing, Judge Richard Bond, said: \"All the victim did was to try and stop you being aggressive towards others. \"It ended up with you quite deliberately using your teeth as a weapon and you bit off a really large chunk. About half of his ear has completely disappeared. \"This is not something that happens in a millisecond - to bite through somebody's ear takes real determination and a real effort.\"",
        "It was one of several measures European and African leaders agreed to reduce the flow of people into Europe. The leaders said their aim was to \"address the root causes of migration.\" The Europe-Africa meeting was planned after around 800 migrants died when their boat sank off Libya in April. Senegal's President Macky Sall, who currently heads the West African regional group Ecowas, told journalists on the sidelines of the summit that the money pledged was \"not enough for the whole of Africa.\" Later, at the closing press conference, he said he was pleased with the trust fund, but said he would like to see it \"more generously financed.\" Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou echoed the Senegalese president's sentiments and added that \"reform of global governance\" was also needed, to make world trade fairer, Reuters news agency reports. While Somalia's Prime Minister Omar Abdirashidali Sharmatke told the BBC: \"What Africa needs today is not charity, but investment.\" EU Council President Donald Tusk said the summit had agreed \"a long list of very concrete actions to be implemented by the end of 2016.\" These include setting up a joint European and African team in Niger to tackle people smuggling and increasing the number of visas available to students and researchers. \"We are under no illusions that we can improve the situation overnight but we are committed to giving people alternatives to risking their lives,\" Mr Tusk said. The European trust fund is supposed to \"foster stability.... and to contribute to better migration management,\" according to a European Union statement. It is also aimed at \"promoting economic.... opportunities, security and development\" in the 23 African countries named which, along with Senegal, include Nigeria, Eritrea and Libya. The money will be spent on: \"Financial aid to accept deportation of thousands\" declares Algerian daily El-Khabar, before quoting human rights groups warning that Europe was \"forcing African countries to play the role of policeman.\" However, Germany's tabloid Bild asks: \"Why is Chancellor Merkel negotiating with Africa's despots?\" in its account of the \"tricky Valletta summit.\" Similarly, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung says the EU's offer of money for fewer refugees from Africa was making critics \"accuse the EU of showing its real values by cooperating with unjust regimes.\" In neighbouring France, Le Figaro urges President Francois Hollande to \"have the courage\" to drastically cut all kinds of aid for migrants. \"In the short term, what is he waiting for to close the Calais'jungle'.... and change the policy against clandestine immigration?\" In Russia, state-controlled Channel One TV describes the summit as \"another attempt by Europe to stop the chaos,\" noting that \"whilst Europe and Africa are bargaining with each other, thousands are embarking on fatal trips in the Mediterranean.\" The 1.9bn fund is in addition to the 20bn the EU already spends on development assistance in Africa every year, Mr Tusk said. The fund is also supposed to be boosted by contributions by individual member states, but only a small amount had been pledged. The UN says some 150,000 people from African countries such as Eritrea, Nigeria and Somalia have made the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean. But this has been dwarfed by the arrival of some 650,000 people - mostly Syrians - via Turkey and Greece. There have been more than 3,000 deaths as people try to make the crossing. BBC world affairs reporter Richard Galpin says the crisis has evolved so quickly this year that European leaders have been struggling to keep up and formulate any coherent policies.",

The crew was taken in August while travelling through territory largely controlled by extremist militants. Libya has been in turmoil since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and now has two competing governments and numerous militia groups. Faraj al-Barassi, a district army commander in eastern Libya, told Reuters that militants loyal to Islamic State (IS) were responsible for the killings. IS-affiliated militants have established a strong presence in parts of Libya, including Derna where the kidnapping is believed to have taken place. Parts of Libya have descended into lawless chaos following the overthrow of Gaddafi, allowing extremists to gain ground. A February report by Human Rights Watch said there was a \"climate of impunity\" in the country that \"allowed militias to assault, threaten, kidnap, or even kill journalists.\" Libya's internationally recognised government has fled from the capital Tripoli to the eastern city of Tobruk, while a rival parliament has been established in Tripoli itself.",

Hamilton said: \"Big congratulations to Valtteri. Fantastic job and he deserves the win. He has been fast all weekend. \"For me, just a very, very odd weekend. I am just hopeful in the next races I will be able to pick up the pace.\" Bottas' win ensured the damage to Hamilton in the championship was limited as much as possible - Vettel now leads by 13 points but it would have been 20 had the German won the race. \"It's great we are ahead of the Ferraris,\" the Briton said. \"It has stopped Sebastian pulling away too far.\" Hamilton was more than half a second slower than Bottas in qualifying and as the Finn made a blistering start from third and took the lead at the first corner, Hamilton did not make ground from fourth on the grid. The 32-year-old suffered overheating problems as he chased Raikkonen in the first stint of the race and dropped back over the pit-stop period to finish 25 seconds behind the Finn and 36 behind Bottas. \"I don't remember the last time we had that [overheating],\" Hamilton said. \"It meant I was out of the race from the get-go. \"I think I had the pace to fight with Kimi but the car was just overheating the whole the time. I'm sure we will go back to the drawing board and figure it out.\" Bottas joined Mercedes over the winter following the retirement of world champion Nico Rosberg. Bottas said his first win felt \"surreal,\" but added: \"It's a good feeling and I am happy.\" He added: \"I always knew I could get good results if everything goes right and I always trust in my ability. But it's nice to get confirmation that the results are possible. \"It took quite a while, more than 80 races for me, but it's definitely worth the wait.

        "Poor weather conditions are forcing the Solar Impulse craft to head to Japan to land. The pilot was 36 hours into what was expected to be a six-day journey from China to Hawaii. The team will now wait in Japan for clearer skies before attempting to continue. Swiss pilot Andre Borschberg, who is flying solo, tweeted that he was disappointed but looking forward to the next attempt. Project co-founder Bertrand Piccard, who has been watching the flight from mission control, in Monaco, said: \"We are not daredevils, we are explorers. \"We have to put safety at the top of all of our priorities. \"Everyone is very happy with the plane - but the weather does not fit. \"We land in Nagoya and we wait for better conditions to continue.\" The plane should arrive at the Komaki airfield in Nagoya at approximately 23:00 local time (14:00 GMT) and its progress can be tracked on the Solar Impulse website. A spokesperson for the team said the batteries were currently fully charged. This is the seventh leg in an attempt to circumnavigate the globe using just the energy of the Sun. LEG 1: 9 March.

Nanjing (China) to Kalaeloa, Hawaii (USA) - 8,200km; journey aborted, plane diverted to Nagoya, Japan The experimental craft, which is covered in 17,000 solar cells, took off from Abu Dhabi in March. The Pacific crossing, however, was always going to be the most challenging part of this epic journey. Solar Impulse had already waited more than a month in Nanjing for the right weather conditions to open up over the Pacific. It needs not only favourable winds to push forward, but also cloud-free skies during the day to soak up enough energy from the Sun to enable nighttime flying on its batteries. The team's meteorologists thought they had identified a suitable weather window - and the plane set off at 18:39 GMT on Saturday. Mr Borschberg had been making good progress. However, in the early hours of Monday morning (GMT), the Solar Impulse team announced it was putting the plane in a holding pattern. The pilot was asked to circle over the Sea of Japan while meteorologists assessed whether they could find their way through a worsening weather front close to Hawaii. Mr Borschberg was just hours away from the point of no return - the stage in the flight where, if something were to go wrong, the plane would be too far from land to turn back and Mr Borschberg would have to bail out into the ocean. The team decided this was not a risk worth taking. By the time the craft lands, it will have flown more than 3,000km (1,860 miles) in about 40 hours, which is already the longest flight ever made by a solar-powered airplane in terms of both duration and distance. While Mr Borschberg waits in Japan, his support team will try to identify another weather window to get to kalaeloa airport in Hawaii. However, the fear is that further delays could have an impact on later stages of the round-the-world quest. Ideally, the team needs to cross America, and then the Atlantic, before the hurricane season starts to peak in August. Follow Rebecca on Twitter.",

        "The county has received PS1bn of aid over the past 15 years with more than PS400m in the pipeline until 2020 because of its relatively weak economy.

While Britain as a whole has paid to be part of the EU, Cornwall is in the unusual position of being a net beneficiary. Despite the huge investment in projects like the Combined Universities in Penryn, the Eden Project and Cornwall Airport Newquay, along with Superfast broadband - many people simply do not think they have felt any benefit. And some say the fact that Cornwall still qualifies for this extra funding is an indication it hasn't sparked the growth intended. Remain campaigners have warned Cornwall has always fared badly from Westminster and are not confident of future support of the scale seen from the EU. But with five out of six Cornish MP's backing Leave during this campaign perhaps this vote here isn't surprising. Eric Nicholls, Chairman of Cornwall Manufacturers' Group, said: \"Whether Cornwall will continue to receive its EU funding is far from certain, as are the pledges from the Remain side that this would be met from central government.\" Sarah Newton, Conservative MP for Truro and Falmouth, who voted Remain, said she wanted to \"make sure the money gets into Cornwall so we can carry on making progress in getting well-paid jobs.\" Cllr Tim Dwelly, leader of the Labour Group at Cornwall Council, said: \"This is a disaster for Cornwall. Years of special EU funding for Cornwall are going to end. \"That funding has given us fibre broadband, a university, superb sixth form colleges, dual carriageways, airport investment, rail improvement, support for farmers and all kinds of business.\" Chris Pomfret, former Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership chairman, and now chairman of governors at Falmouth University said: \"I'm worried there will be turmoil that could go on for years.\" William Arnold tweeted: \"It's Ok though we can carry on being serfs in a theme park for second home owners and their children.\" A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: \"It is important to understand that there will be no immediate changes. \"We must now prepare for a negotiation to exit the EU that will ensure the interests of all parts of the United Kingdom are protected and advanced.\"",
        "Rowett was furious after his side lost a two-goal lead to be held 2-2 at St Andrew's to end any hope of making the Championship play-offs. \"We've held on to leads at lot better this season,\" Morrison told BBC WM. \"We're probably far too open - we need to get that bit between our teeth.\" Rowett called his side \"unprofessional\" and \"lacking desire\" after seeing Clayton Donaldson's brace cancelled out by two goals in the last 17 minutes, with Greg Cunningham's equaliser coming a minute from time. \"We need to see the game out, especially at home - they had no right to get back into it,\" said 28-year-old Morrison. \"It was very disappointing and a few choice words were said. \"Early on in the season, we had a tighter shape and people were working harder maybe to be more difficult to beat.\" Blues went into the game with only a mathematical chance of finishing in the top six but the result has now extinguished their promotion hopes. \"It's a difficult time after such a good season and it turning out the way it has,\" added Morrison. \"It is an anti-climax, the fans are disappointed we're not still chasing the play-offs and that does affect the players but we're still going to put 100 in.\"",
        "Petro Poroshenko said 80 of Ukraine's troops left on Wednesday morning after several days of fierce fighting. Russia said Ukrainian forces had tried to fight their way out of the town after being encircled but Mr Poroshenko insisted they were never surrounded. The rebel advance on Debaltseve, which came in spite of the recent ceasefire agreement, has been widely condemned. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the rebels' offensive had put the wider peace agreement at risk and urged Russia to \"use all its influence on the separatists to make them respect the ceasefire.\" He also called on Moscow to withdraw its forces from Ukraine, saying Russian troops, artillery and air defence units were still active in the country. Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted the rebels' actions in Debaltseve had not violated the ceasefire because it was a rebel-held city when the peace agreement was signed last week. He urged rebels to provide troops who surrendered with food and clothes and said he hoped the situation in the city would \"not be used to find a pretext to actually undermine [the agreement].\" Eyewitnesses saw dozens of tanks and columns of weary Ukrainian troops retreating from Debaltseve on Wednesday. Russia's state-controlled Channel One TV showed footage of what it said were rebels raising their flag on top of a high-rise building in the town. Later rebel spokesman Eduard Basurin was quoted in Russian media as saying Debaltseve was fully under the control of separatists, although there were still \"disparate groups of the enemy\" in the southern part of town. One rebel commander in the city told the BBC that conditions were dire, with no electricity and a shortage of food and water. He said rebels were sharing their rations with the remaining civilians. President Poroshenko said in a statement: \"Debaltseve was under our control, there was no encirclement, and our troops left the area in a planned and organised manner.\" He called for \"a firm reaction from the world to Russia's brutal violation of the Minsk agreements, the ceasefire regime and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry.\" Mr Poroshenko visited the soldiers who had left Debaltseve in the town of Artemivsk on Wednesday. Earlier, he said it would be an honour to shake hands with \"Ukrainian heroes.\" A senior Ukrainian military official said 22 Ukrainian soldiers had died in Debaltseve over the past three days. Earlier, an official at a morgue in Artemivsk said the bodies of 25 Ukrainian soldiers had been brought to the facility from Debaltseve but this has not been confirmed. Rebels have claimed that hundreds of Ukrainian troops were killed in clashes around the city, but Mr Poroshenko denied this. The government in Kiev admitted that that some soldiers were taken prisoner in Debaltseve, but gave no details on how many were seized. All Wednesday, the road out of Debaltseve into government-held territory thundered to the sound of retreating armour - tanks and troop carriers full of exhausted, sometimes defiant soldiers. In a bus by the side of the road, I found one Yuri slumped on his seat, across the aisle from a sleeping colleague. He said the situation had become increasingly dire and individual units had taken their own decisions to leave. They were running out of ammunition and in danger of being surrounded, he told me. He blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for deceiving everyone about the ceasefire. We know him well by now, he said. When he says something is guaranteed, that means there's some kind of trap coming up. In nearby fields, mortars and multiple rocket launchers fired back at the rebels - providing cover for those still trying to leave Debaltseve. President Poroshenko says the withdrawal was planned and organised, but on the ground it looked like a hasty retreat in the face of overwhelming odds. The withdrawal came after Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Ukraine's troops in Debaltseve to surrender. Mr Putin is due to speak by telephone later on Wednesday to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Mr Poroshenko, according to the French government. Spokesman Stephane Le Foll insisted the agreement announced last week by the four leaders to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine was not dead, and that progress had been made. International observers monitoring the truce have been unable to enter Debaltseve. The city has become a key prize for rebels and government forces, as it sits on a strategic railway line linking the rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. Most of its 25,000 population has been evacuated but about 7,000 civilians are still believed trapped by the fighting. The ceasefire, which came into effect on Sunday, has been broadly observed elsewhere and some rebel heavy weaponry was said to have been withdrawn. The UN says more than 5,600 people have been killed in the conflict, but there are fears the actual death toll could be much higher. Fighting began in eastern Ukraine in April, a month after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula. Ukraine's pro-Western government says Russia is supporting the separatists with troops and weapons, but the Kremlin has consistently denied this. Minsk agreement: Key points",
        "The man, known as David, said he wanted answers about how Lincolnshire Police dealt with allegations against Gordon Dawson, a farmer from Spilsby. Mr Dawson shot himself in 2007 after officers informed him of the inquiry. In a statement, Lincolnshire Police said \"procedures were correctly followed at the time\" but policy has subsequently changed. David claimed Mr Dawson had repeatedly abused him from the age of 15. According to Lincolnshire Police, the first allegation was made in 1999 but no action was taken due to \"insufficient evidence.\" In 2006 police arrested Mr Dawson after four other men came forward claiming they were also abused as children between 1964 and 1986. In early 2007 another alleged victim came forward. An investigating officer phoned Mr Dawson on 23 March 2007 to tell him he would be questioned further and a few hours later he was found dead at his home. Following Mr Dawson's death the investigation was dropped but David later complained to the police about the way the investigation was handled. Speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, David said: \"We've had no justice, no finals, no process. \"It's been shutdown, shutdown all the way. I just want some answers.\" Supt Rick Hatton said: \"We have revisited the circumstances surrounding the investigation into Mr Dawson and are satisfied that the investigation that took place was thorough and robust, and no misconduct took place. \"However, a number of lessons were learned in relation to best practice and fed back to the Public Protection Unit. \"We are very sympathetic to the position of the victims in this case and appreciate they may feel that Mr Dawson was not brought to justice.\" The force said any similar situation today \"would see Mr Dawson's guns removed from him as policy is now quite different.\"",
        "A 38-year-old man, who was a back seat car passenger, is in a critical but stable condition in hospital following the B9080 crash at about 22:15 on Wednesday. The injured passenger suffered serious stomach and abdomen injuries. The Vauxhall Zafira was travelling south when it crashed with a First bus between Kirkliston and Winchburgh. The driver of the car, a 58-year-old man, suffered spinal injuries and a fractured ankle. The front seat passenger, a 34-year-old man, had injuries to his face and leg. All were admitted to hospital. Three of the bus passengers were treated in hospital for minor injuries. They have all since been discharged. Police said the driver and six other passengers on the single-decker bus were treated at the scene. The bus had 26 people on board. A First Bluebird spokeswoman: \"We can confirm that one of our Service 38 vehicles was involved in a collision yesterday at around 22:15 between Kirkliston and Winchburgh. The bus was travelling to Falkirk from Edinburgh. \"Unfortunately the incident resulted in a number of injuries and our thoughts are with the injured at this time. \"We have launched an investigation to establish exactly what happened and are assisting Police Scotland with their inquiries.\"",
        "As flames neared the seaside resort of Calampiso, fishermen and boat-owners were drafted in to aid the evacuation. Matteo Rizzo, the mayor of nearby San Vito Lo Capo, appealed for help from \"anyone with safe and reliable boats.\" Writing on Facebook, he called the situation at the village west of Palermo \"very urgent.\" Evacuees were taken to schools in San Vito, and the mayor urged his \"friendly and generous\" town to pull together. \"We need minibuses and cars to pick people up at the little port and take them to school buildings,\" he said. \"Let's all do something.\" There are no reports of injuries caused by the Calampiso fire, but witnesses described running to the beach as their accommodation burned. Italian paper La Stampa quoted one evacuated tourist, Stella Belliotti, as saying: \"We fled in swimwear and slippers. Our apartment was engulfed in flames. They were right above us. I took my daughter and I went to the beach. They made us go on the boats that go around Zingaro. First women and children, and then the others.\" Temperatures in Italy's arid south have reached over 40C (104F) after months of little rainfall. Images from the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, in the southern region of Campania, show clouds of smoke over a kilometre high pouring into the air near Naples. The national fire service said it was engaged in 441 operations across Italy on Wednesday, including 288 wildfires. Those at Vesuvius are among the most serious. Around 70 firefighters have tackled the huge fire on the ground, alongside Civil Protection volunteers, and three helicopters have been deployed. Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti said a man had been arrested on suspicion of arson in the area. \"If someone set fire to Vesuvius, I want to see them in jail for 15 years,\" Italian media quoted him as saying. The minister said a decision would be made shortly about whether to send the army to assist the stricken areas. The World Wildlife Fund has warned that thousands of people, animals, and a nature reserve are at risk around the volcano. Italy's government declared a state of emergency last week in response to the drought in the northern provinces of Parma and Piacenza, and opposition politicians are demanding the same for the wildfires.",

        "It is a decision that has been well telegraphed in recent months, with both agency officials and industry chiefs expressing their doubts that all the hardware could be made ready in time. The aim of the mission is to land a rover on the Red Planet. Capable of drilling up to 2m below the surface, it would search for signs of past or present life. It is the second part of the so-called ExoMars programme. The first part - a satellite to study the atmosphere of the planet - was launched successfully in March and should arrive in October. But the surface robot will now follow four years behind, instead of two (planetary alignment dictates that the most efficient launch opportunities become available at 26-month intervals). The announcement of the launch slip was issued by the European Space Agency (Esa) on Monday. Russian engineers have been struggling for a while to keep their design for the vehicle's landing mechanism on the 2018 timeline, and in Europe, too, some components and instruments were considered to have very little margin in their development schedule. A \"tiger team\" set up by Esa and the Russian space agency (Roscosmos), and which included European and Russian industries, could find no solutions to recover lost time. Rolf de Groot is head of Esa's Robotic Exploration Coordination Office. He told BBC News: \"It is not only the components of the spacecraft; it's several of the instruments. \"What we have been doing lately is seeing if we could shorten the assembly, integration and testing (AIT) phase to something that would be acceptable from a risk point of view, but still make the 2018 launch. \"Very recently, we have concluded that this is not possible without adding a large amount of additional risk to an already risky mission. So, we decided the only responsible thing to do was move to the 2020 launch date.\" For European scientists and engineers who have been working on the rover concept, such delay has become part and parcel of the endeavour. First envisaged as a small technology demonstration mission, the robot vehicle was approved by European nations back in 2005, with a launch first pencilled in for 2011. Then, as ambitions grew and the design was beefed up, the start date was put back. At first, it was shifted to 2013, but further problems saw slippage to 2016, and then again to 2018. At the root of the ExoMars rover's problems has been the lack of a full and proper budget to carry it through. At one stage, in 2009, Esa decided to join forces with America to try to make it happen, only to see Nasa walk away three years later when its priorities changed. That could have killed the project there and then, but for an offer from the Russians to fill the partnership position vacated by the US. Nonetheless, as events have now shown, there has been insufficient time to recast the mission. And the money issue has not gone away. Indeed, it now becomes a bigger problem. Already, there is a shortfall in the required budget for the rover on the European side. With the additional delay of two years, this deficit only increases. Esa and the two biggest European space companies - Thales Alenia Space and Airbus Defence and Space - are in the final stages of agreeing a price to build rover. They are at odds over the figure in euros, but the aim is to get the negotiations done before a meeting of member state delegations in June. It is at this council gathering that Esa officials will set out a new path for the project. One intention is to continue apace with European preparations, and then store all hardware for a year before the last stages of AIT. This would mitigate some of the additional costs that come from maintaining large teams. The two nations most invested in ExoMars are Italy and the UK, with Britain charged with assembling the rover. Airbus Defence and Space has recently built a cleanroom at its Stevenage facilities north of London to perform this task. If there is one positive to come out of the delay it is that the list of potential landing sites will now lengthen. The particular flight parameters of a 2019 arrival at Mars limited the rover to really only one destination - Oxia Planum. An arrival two years later opens up the possibility of reaching other targets of high science interest. and follow me on Twitter: BBCAmos",

        "Former England batsman Boycott said Morgan was not \"as good as he thinks he is\" and \"not so clever\" against top-class bowling. But pace bowler Anderson responded: \"That's rich coming from him. Media playback is not supported on this device \"Morgan is a world-class player and has been for over 100 games. We know how destructive he is when he's in form.\" Boycott, who scored 1,082 runs in 34 one-day innings for England, at an average of 36.06, was passing judgement on a poor sequence of form that has seen Morgan dismissed for less than 20 in nine of his last 11 one-day international innings. Anderson, though, defended his captain, saying: \"He has been great for us. We're hopeful he can get some form. We've seen him get a hundred on this trip against Australia.\" The 32-year-old was speaking before England's opening World Cup game against co-hosts Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday (03:30 GMT). Former England captain Michael Vaughan said Morgan had never claimed to be \"the greatest,\" but disagreed with Boycott's comments. \"I think he can have his opinion,\" said Vaughan. \"I work with him, respect him a lot, I like him, but I disagree with what he's said about Eoin Morgan. \"He needs runs, but in the past Morgan has had the kind of mentality to produce on the big stage.\" More than 90,000 spectators are expected to be in attendance as England look to improve on a run that has seen them lose 13 of their last 15 ODIs against Australia down under. \"It's obviously a big game for both sides,\" said Anderson, who has taken 264 wickets in 188 matches since making his debut at the MCG in 2002. \"As a cricketer, you want to play in big games like this. We're guessing that the majority of the crowd will be against us, so it's something we're prepared for. It's something that we have to try to soak up and enjoy. \"We feel confident that we can beat anyone on our day. Confidence is building in our team and we're hoping that we can put things together when it really matters.\" With Australia captain Michael Clarke ruled out of Saturday's opener because of injury, George Bailey has been confirmed as his replacement. However, Bailey admitted that he was likely to lose his place in the team when Clarke returns for the second match against Bangladesh. The 32-year-year-old batsman also said that Australia should enjoy the extra support they receive as co-hosts, rather than feel the pressure of being favourites to win the tournament. \"I don't think I'll keep my place, but that's fine,\" said Bailey. \"I think it's great that Michael is on track to come back, he's done a remarkable job to be available for the Bangladesh game. \"I'm not feeling the pressure of expectation. We get to enjoy some home comforts and home support. We should embrace the opportunity of a home World Cup. \"There have been some amazing Australian players who have never had the chance of a home World Cup. You can view that as pressure, or view it as a wonderful opportunity.\" With so much of the conversation in Australia surrounding the fitness of Clarke, former leg-spinner Shane Warne had his say on the process the captain has had to get through since injuring his right hamstring on 13 December. \"Some of the stuff I've been reading about Michael Clarke, you'd think he was 45. He's only 33,\" said Warne, who is 45 himself. \"They've tried to break him with all the fitness stuff, but he's ready to go, fitter than he's ever been in five years. I would have picked him.\" Warne, a World Cup winner in 1999, also said England were capable of shocking Australia on Saturday and identified Ravi Bopara - whose place may be under threat - as one of the key men. \"England need James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Ian Bell, Eoin Morgan and Ravi Bopara to fire. If a few of those guys have a day out at the World Cup, they could go all the way.\" In an attempt to ramp up the tension and create a partisan atmosphere before the Australia-England match, a betting company has placed posters around Melbourne that read \"Missing: pair of balls. If found please return to the England cricket team.\" On Friday, they took it one stage further, draping banners from two helicopters that circled the city, flying over the MCG just as England were training. If England were unimpressed, so too was Bailey, who sarcastically said the banners were \"very witty.\"",
        "The sanctions freeze the US assets of those affected, and stop US entities from doing business with them. Those targeted include the interior minister and the head of the army. Last week, President Donald Trump vowed \"strong and swift economic actions\" if Mr Maduro held the poll, due on Sunday. \"Who do these imperialists in the United States think they are?\" Mr Maduro said on Wednesday. \"The government of the world?\" He also called the sanctions \"illegal, insolent and unprecedented.\" The vote, which Venezuela says will proceed as planned, is to choose the 545 members of a new constituent assembly that would rival the opposition-held National Assembly. Critics say the president is trying to cement a dictatorship. He argues it is the only way to bring peace back to the divided nation. The US sanctions also target the head of Venezuela's National Electoral Council, Tibisay Lucena, and former vice president Elias Jaua, who is leading the presidential commission organising Sunday's vote. The inclusion of senior figures from the state oil company PDVSA underlines a further threat from Washington that sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector could be next. Announcing the sanctions, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US \"will not ignore the Maduro regime's ongoing efforts to undermine democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.\" \"Anyone elected to the National Constituent Assembly should know that their role in undermining democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela could expose them to potential US sanctions,\" he said. Mr Maduro has accused the US of stoking unrest against his government, but President Trump said last week that Washington \"will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\" A 48-hour general strike is currently under way in Venezuela, in protest at the planned vote. A 30-year-old man was killed on Wednesday at a protest in Ejido, in the western state of Merida. The cause of his death was not initially given. More than 100 people have been killed in protest-related violence, since almost daily anti-government protests began on 1 April. The unrest has further hammered an imploding economy that is running short of food and medicine. Venezuela's opposition is refusing to take part in the elections for the assembly, which it says is a tool for Mr Maduro to entrench himself in power. On Tuesday, opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez called on Venezuelans to step up street protests, saying the president's plan to rewrite the constitution would bring an end to the country's democracy. Speaking from his home, where he is held under house arrest, he called on the military to withdraw its support from the government. \"I invite you to not be accomplices to the annihilation of the republic, to a constitutional fraud, to repression,\" he said in a video posted on Twitter [in Spanish]. Demonstrations and a 24-hour strike held last week seem only to have hardened the government's resolve to go ahead with the election. But the opposition says it is confident it will be able to shut down most of the country until Friday, when a massive demonstration has been scheduled in the capital, Caracas.",

        "The 10-year-old Irish-bred horse collapsed after narrowly beating Thistlecrack to win the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day. He was treated by veterinary staff before being pronounced dead. The British Horseracing Authority confirmed the horse suffered from a \"severe pulmonary haemorrhage.\" Tony Welsh, acting chief veterinary officer for the BHA, said: \"Episodes such as this are rare, and can occur in horses which have no underlying health issues, and amongst all disciplines of sport horses. \"In spite of the rarity of these incidents, as a sport we are determined to do more to understand what causes these symptoms, and whether more can be done to prevent it.\" In Saturday's race, King George winner Thistlecrack caught Many Clouds close to the finish but the Trevor Hemmings-owned gelding, ridden by Leighton Aspell, fought back to win.

        "When Peter Young was in charge of mental health services at Australia's refugee detention centres, he says it became increasingly clear that authorities wanted to \"keep the lid\" on health issues that asylum seekers were experiencing. The senior Australian psychiatrist says immigration authorities wanted details about the high rates of mental illness among children at the centres to be removed from his official reports. He was asked to delete clinical opinions that made a direct link between prolonged detention and mental health problems. Dr Young was director of International Health and Medical Services (IHMS) - a private health service contracted by Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) to provide health care to detention centres - a role he held for three years. Its services covered the country's controversial offshore facilities on the Pacific island of Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, where all asylum seekers who try to reach Australia by boat are sent - never to be resettled in Australia even if their refugee claims are proven. In advising on treatment, Dr Young argued with authorities who considered acts of self-harm by detainees as \"a type of bad behaviour, rather than a manifestation of people in extreme states of hopelessness.\" He says he was later refused permission to use data he had collected about health issues in detention centres in presentations or publications. \"They made it very clear this type of information should never get into the public domain,\" he told the BBC. Now there is fear that health workers could go to prison for such revelations under new Border Force laws that threaten \"entrusted people\" with up to two years in prison if they reveal protected information about Australia's detention facilities. In recent months, hundreds of doctors and nurses have staged public protests in cities across Australia, posing with their hands over their mouths to highlight the risk of being silenced. Their concerns are shared by Australia's 13 peak medical groups, who have accused the government of trying to \"gag\" health professionals. The World Medical Association has also warned the laws are \"in striking conflict with basic principles of medical ethics.\" Critics say the gag is the latest act in a \"culture of secrecy\" around tough Australian policies designed to stop boatloads of asylum seekers from arriving on Australian shores. The government is unapologetic about its stance on \"stopping the boats\" It denies it is trying to silence doctors and nurses or that it wants to suppress health information. The Border Force says the new laws are to protect \"operational security\" and insists robust internal mechanisms are in place through which medical concerns can be raised and addressed. The federal Labor opposition agrees. It supported the legislation and says health workers will be protected by'whistleblower' protections under the Commonwealth Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013. However, legal experts say it is not clear what sort of information would be protected and there are a range of internal hurdles that could delay or deter disclosures. That confusion alone may suit the government, says human rights lawyer George Newhouse. \"I think the government is very happy with the uncertainty around the laws and how they are likely to have a'chilling effect' on potential whistleblowers,\" he told the BBC. Given very restricted public access to Australian detention centres, health and social workers have been key sources of information about conditions. Two former medical officers at the Christmas Island detention facility, last year graphically catalogued a range of health concerns in an article in the Medical Journal of Australia, saying, among other things, that \"degrading, harmful and inappropriate incidents\" had occurred at the centre. \"Degrading, harmful and inappropriate incidents have occurred, including requiring asylum seekers to undergo health assessments while exhausted, dehydrated and filthy, with clothing soiled by urine and faeces; addressing individuals by number instead of name, artificial delays in transfer of patients for tertiary care; confiscation and destruction of medications, medical records and medical devices; and detention of children despite clear evidence of significant harm.\" Medical Journal of Australia, Volume 201, October 2014 Dr Young believes the risk of being sent to prison will discourage medical staff from speaking out in future, even if no prosecutions are launched. Other detention centre practices like employing staff from developing countries who are not protected by Australian labour or whistleblower laws also \"keep the lid on all information flowing out of the system,\" he says. \"My position is that the medical profession is expected to speak out when it comes to issues that harm people's health. \"There would be no controversy if I was speaking about cigarette smoking or asbestos exposure. \"The evidence is very clear that prolonged detention in such circumstances causes a negative health impact, and keeping those health impacts secret makes the situation worse.\" Marie McInerney is a Melbourne-based writer.",

        "The Supreme Court case related to federal law limiting gun ownership for people convicted of domestic violence. Justice Thomas has said in the past he prefers not to \"badger\" lawyers as they present their arguments in court. He spoke weeks after the death of one of the most conservative Supreme Court members, Justice Antonin Scalia, which may shift the court's balance of power. Justice Thomas on Monday asked a lawyer for the Department of Justice whether the violation of any law \"suspends a [person's] constitutional rights.\" The court is considering placing new limits on the reach of the federal law banning people convicted of domestic violence from owning guns. It was the court's second week of oral arguments - when justices are given the chance to question lawyers about their briefs - since the death of Justice Scalia, a friend and fellow conservative of Justice Thomas. The last time he was reported to have asked a question at the high court was during a death penalty case in February 2006. Explaining his silence over the years, Justice Thomas told the Associated Press in 2013: \"We have a lifetime to go back in chambers and to argue with each other.\" He told a group of students in 2000 that \"there's no reason to add to the volume. I also believe strongly, unless I want an answer, I don't ask things.... Usually, if you wait long enough, someone will ask your question.\"",

        "The 26-year-old scored 20 goals in 52 games for Bristol City, after signing from French club Angers in July 2015. The Ivory Coast international had also been the subject of interest from Derby County and Premier League side Hull. Villa had reached an agreement to sign Hull forward Abel Hernandez, but the move fell through over personal terms. Bristol City owner Steve Lansdown had previously said they would not sell Kodjia to any fellow Championship club, and that any deal would have to exceed PS10m. The deal represents the largest transfer fee City have ever received for a player, surpassing the PS3.5m the club sold Ade Akinbiyi to Wolves for in September 1999. Villa boss Roberto Di Matteo said he had signed a \"proven goalscorer\" in Kodjia, while City chief operating officer Mark Ashton said the club had retained a sell-on clause and decided to disclose the fee \"due to the high-profile nature and speculation surrounding the deal.\" Ashton added: \"We've continually told Jonathan that we don't want him to go, but recently he's made it clear that he's aware of the interest of other clubs and that he wanted to leave.\" Kodjia is a proven goal scorer at Championship level, a physical and competitive style of player with greater mobility than a Rudy Gestede or Libor Kozak. Whether he is quite the \"world-class striker\" that Villa chairman Dr Tony Xia promised via his prolific Twitter account is dubious, but he could well thrive on the sort of service Ross McCormack and Jack Grealish are capable of providing. The Villa squad was always going to need revolution rather than evolution after last season's psychologically damaging relegation - Kodjia is the latest component of a summer of change.",

        "Ian Brown, 44, and Daniel Dunkley, 35, died following incidents in their cells at HMP Woodhill last July. Their relatives claim Woodhill's governor has not complied fully with Prison Service Instructions (PSIs). But the governor and the Secretary of State say the judicial review claim is \"neither appropriate or necessary.\" PSIs cover management of prisoners at risk of harm to self, others and from others, early days in custody and medical emergency response codes. Heather Williams QC, for the families, said the claim addressed the \"exceptionally high\" rate of self-inflicted deaths at the Milton Keynes prison. There were seven self-inflicted deaths last year, five in 2015 and 18 at the prison since May 2013. \"The rate of self-inflicted death at HMP Woodhill is far higher than at any other prison, at a time when the suicide rate in the prison estate as a whole is at a record high,\" said Ms Williams. She said the case raised serious ongoing breaches of Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, which protects the right to life, and involved long-term failures to comply with the responsibility placed on the authorities to protect prisoners. James Strachan QC said the governor was well aware of his obligations to comply with the requirements of the PSIs. \"The defendants do not dispute that the number of deaths at the prison is a legitimate matter of concern. \"However, not only have the governor and the Secretary of State taken significant action in 2016 to improve the situation, but as the taskforce approach shows, this is a continuing high priority.\" Lord Justice Irwin and Mr Justice Garnham will give their decision at a later date.",
        "Josh Earnest said the closure of the Cuban detention camp was a national security interest. It was one of the first directives President Barack Obama ordered two months after he was elected in 2008. Inmates have slowly been transferred out and at the start of the year, 122 men were left. The peak population in 2003 was 684. Mr Earnest said the administration was \"in the final stages of drafting a plan to safely and responsibly (close) the prison at Guantanamo Bay and to present that to Congress.\" He added: \"That has been something that our national security officials have been working on for quite some time, primarily because it is a priority of the president.\" In 2009, President Obama admitted the January 2010 deadline he had set for closing the counter-terrorism facility would be missed. Since then, Congress bipartisan opposition has meant the transfer of prisoners to the US has been blocked. Some have been considered too dangerous to be released, but the US holds no evidence that can be used in civilian or military trials against them. The US has slowly been sending prisoners back to their home countries or to third countries, a process Mr Earnest said needs to continue if the facility is to shut. The camp was established in 2002 by the Bush administration to detain the most dangerous suspects for interrogation and the prosecution of war crimes. Controversy has centred around the period of time detainees have been held without charge and the use of interrogation techniques.",
        "The culture committee questioned journalists and bosses at the now-closed News of the World, as well as police and lawyers for hacking victims. Its report has concluded that Mr Murdoch exhibited \"wilful blindness\" to what was going on in News Corporation. But the committee was split six to four with Tory members refusing to endorse the report and branding it \"partisan.\" Conservative Louise Mensch called it \"a real great shame\" that the report's credibility had potentially been \"damaged\" as a result, with the report carried by Labour and Lib Dem members backing it. News Corp said in a statement it was \"carefully reviewing\" the report and would \"respond shortly,\" adding: \"The company fully acknowledges significant wrongdoing at News of the World and apologises to everyone whose privacy was invaded.\" The committee itself does not have the power to impose sanctions, but it raised the possibility of a vote in the House of Commons about whether witnesses had been in contempt of Parliament - and if so, whether those witnesses should be forced to apologise in Parliament. By Robert PestonBusiness editor The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said the report was much more damning than had been anticipated and directly questioned the integrity and honesty of Rupert Murdoch. BBC business editor Robert Peston said it would push Ofcom, the media regulator, closer to the conclusion that BSkyB - 39 owned by News Corp - is not fit and proper to hold a broadcasting licence. Reacting to the report, an Ofcom spokesman said it was \"continuing to assess the evidence - including the new and emerging evidence\" that may assist it in ruling on that issue. The committee of MPs began its inquiry in July 2011 in the wake of fresh revelations about the extent of hacking at the tabloid newspaper, with reported victims including the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and the families of victims of the 77 London bombings. It heard evidence from Mr Murdoch and his son James, and has now concluded that the notion that a hands-on proprietor like Rupert Murdoch had \"no inkling\" that wrongdoing was widespread at the News of the World was \"simply not credible.\" It noted that the newspaper mogul had \"excellent powers of recall and grasp of detail when it suited him,\" and added: \"On the basis of the facts and evidence before the committee, we conclude that, if at all relevant times Rupert Murdoch did not take steps to become fully informed about phone hacking, he turned a blind eye and exhibited wilful blindness to what was going on in his companies and publications.\" Tory MPs objected specifically to the line branding Mr Murdoch \"not fit,\" with one, Philip Davies, telling a press conference the committee had seen \"absolutely no evidence\" to endorse such a \"completely ludicrous\" conclusion. But Labour MP Tom Watson said \"more than any individual alive,\" Mr Murdoch was to blame for phone hacking, and it was right to \"raise the bar\" of the report and make that clear. The committee also criticised three former News International executives - one-time executive chairman Les Hinton, former News of the World editor Colin Myler and former legal manager Tom Crone - accusing them of giving misleading evidence. Mr Myler, who is now editor of the New York Daily News, said he had \"always sought to be accurate and consistent\" when speaking to the committee and stood by his evidence. Mr Hinton said the allegations against him were \"unfounded, unfair and erroneous.\" Mr Crone said he accepted there were \"valid criticisms of my conduct in this matter,\" but he was \"the subject of serious allegations which lack foundation.\" News Corp as a whole was guilty of \"huge failings of corporate governance\" and, throughout, its instinct had been \"to cover up rather than seek out wrongdoing and discipline the perpetrators,\" the committee said. And it concluded: \"Corporately, the News of the World and News International misled the committee about the true nature and extent of the internal investigations they professed to have carried out in relation to phone hacking; by making statements they would have known were not fully truthful; and by failing to disclose documents which would have helped expose the truth.\" James Murdoch told the committee last summer that he did not see an email which suggested that hacking was more widespread at the paper than previously acknowledged - a claim disputed by Mr Myler and Mr Crone in their evidence. On that matter, the report concluded that James Murdoch was \"consistent\" in relation to the so-called \"For Neville\" email, but he had demonstrated \"wilful ignorance\" about what had been going on, which \"clearly raises questions of competence\" on his part. James Murdoch has insisted he did not know about any wrongdoing at the News of the World, but took \"his share\" of responsibility for not uncovering it earlier. He gave evidence alongside his father Rupert, who at one point during the hearing was attacked by a man who rushed forward from the public gallery and threw a paper plate of foam at him. The committee also said former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks must \"accept responsibility\" for presiding over a culture at the News of the World that led to journalists impersonating members of Milly Dowler's family and hacking the teenager's phone. And it criticised Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer and former Acting Deputy Commissioner at the Metropolitan Police John Yates for failing to ensure hacking claims were properly investigated. After initially claiming malpractice was limited to one \"rogue\" reporter at the News of the World, News International has now settled dozens of civil cases admitting liability for hacking between 2001 and 2006. More than 6,000 possible victims have been identified and the police have so far made a number of arrests in connection with an investigation reopened in January 2011 - although no charges have yet been brought. Asked whether David Cameron regarded Rupert Murdoch as a fit person to run a media company, his official spokesman said: \"That is a matter for the regulatory authorities, not for the government.\" Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg both said Ofcom must now be allowed to come to its own conclusion. The hacking revelations led to the closure of the News of the World and the government's decision to set up a judicial inquiry into press standards headed by Lord Leveson. Appearing before the Leveson Inquiry last week, Rupert Murdoch said there had been a \"cover-up\" which \"shielded\" senior figures at the paper and its parent company - including himself and his son James - from knowledge of wrongdoing taking place.",

        "\"I wasn't 100 sober,\" she said at an event with fellow Justice Antonin Scalia. She said she \"couldn't resist the fine wine\" at the dinner which traditionally brings together some of the court's justices before the speech. At 81, Justice Ginsburg is the oldest serving judge on the Supreme Court. She was asked about the incident by the moderator at an event at George Washington University on Thursday evening. Justice Ginsburg was repeatedly pictured slumbering in her chair as President Barack Obama addressed the joint session of Congress in the House of Representatives on 20 January. \"The audience for the most part is awake, but they're bobbing up and down all the time. And we sit there as stone-faced, sober judges. But we're not. \"At least I wasn't 100 sober when we went to the State of the Union,\" she said, provoking audience laughter. Justice Ginsburg said she had vowed to stick to sparkling water after dozing at the speech in past years, but was unable to resist the lure of a \"very fine California wine\" brought by Justice Anthony Kennedy. \"In the end, the dinner was so delicious it needed wine,\" she said. \"Well, that's the first intelligent thing you've done,\" quipped Justice Scalia. Former Justice David Souter used to give her a pinch when he spotted the warning signs in years gone by, Justice Ginsburg said, but the judges beside her this time were \"more timid.\"",
        "US carrier United Airlines has said it will end daily flights between Houston, Texas and Nigeria's commercial capital, Lagos, on 30 June. It follows Spanish airline Iberia's decision to pull out in May. Falling oil prices have hurt Africa's biggest economy, which has contracted for the first time since 2004. As a result of the foreign currency restrictions, airlines have been unable to repatriate up to 600m (PS417m) in ticket sales, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Foreign currency reserves have dwindled to their lowest level in more than ten years and the government introduced a currency peg last year that has created a black market for the naira currency. \"The inability of airlines to access forex in Africa's largest economy, if not solved, will affect air transport services to, from and within Nigeria and undermine the country's position as West Africa's aviation hub,\" Iata said this week. Iberia said it was leaving Nigeria due to \"very difficult operating circumstances and dwindling passenger numbers.\" Businesses operating in Nigeria are struggling to get their hands on dollars, sterling or euros, says the BBC's West Africa correspondent Martin Patience. The official exchange rate, which is controlled by the government is also very low compared to the black market rate. \"If you take 1, the official rate is 200 naira but if you then go on the black market where you will get the cash it can often cost you double that and airlines...simply can't go on the black market to get business done,\" says Patience.

        "Susan Fowler, a software engineer, wrote a blog post about a \"very, very strange year at Uber.\" In it, she says her manager tried to have sex with her on her first official day at work, sending her messages about his open relationship. It's just the latest blow for a company that has gained a reputation as a bastion of Silicon Valley's macho \"bro\" culture. But is Uber really any more sexist than other tech giants in the Valley? Ms Fowler's claims have resonated with many women in the tech world, and surveys suggest her experiences are not uncommon. According to a 2016 survey, 60 of women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances. The \"Elephant in the Valley\" survey found that 87 of the 220 women interviewed had witnessed demeaning comments from their colleagues. Almost 40 of those who said they were harassed at work did not report the situation, fearing it would damage their careers. \"I was propositioned by a hiring manager early in my career when I was a job candidate,\" one contributor to the study wrote. \"He clearly indicated that if I slept with him, he would make sure I was promoted as his'second in command' as he moved up the ladder in the company.\" Another said she had turned down her CEO's sexual advances the first time they travelled together for work. \"After that, I was never asked to travel with him again,\" she said. \"This impacted my ability to do my job.\" The study followed a high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit in 2015 from former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao - one of those praising Ms Fowler's stand against Uber. On Twitter, Ms Pao said Ms Fowler's blog post shows \"the state of tech in one woman's story, also the story of many women, many people at many companies.\" Sexist van slogans banned in Australia Meet the female gamers challenging sexism Are universities secretly sexist? Discrimination is difficult to quantify - especially when victims are unwilling to speak out. Yet on top of Ms Pao's case, there have been several high-profile lawsuits and sudden exits in the tech world in recent years: Comparing results from different studies with different questions can be problematic - but there are some hints that Silicon Valley has a problem. Statistics on sexual harassment vary widely, but an extensive 1992 US national study found that 41 of women had experienced it; and about 40-50 of women in the EU, according to the United Nations. Both estimates are still lower than the Silicon Valley survey's 60. The 2016 Women in the Workplace study - a major US national survey - found that 19 of the technology sector's top executives are women - broadly in line with sectors like banking, media, or professional services. The same study found that, across all industries, 30 of women who negotiated for a promotion or a better salary were told they were \"bossy,\" \"aggressive\" or \"intimidating.\" In the Elephant in the Valley survey, that rocketed to 84 of women being told they were aggressive (though that question was not specifically about negotiation). The world's biggest tech companies know they're dominated by white men, and many are funding schemes to address that. In its annual diversity and inclusion report, Apple said it had closed pay gaps over the past year by analysing salaries, bonuses and stock grants. Facebook has pledged to give 15m (PS12m) to Code.org, a non-profit group teaching young women and underrepresented minorities how to write computer code. 31-33 of the three biggest tech brands' employees are female - but what about their actual technical staff? 19 of Google's tech workforce is female, compared to 31 within the whole firm 23 of Apple's technology staff are women - and 32 of its global total, including retail 17 of Facebook's technology team are women, it says - and 33 of all its staff And in 2015, Google told USA Today it would invest 150m (PS120m) in workforce diversity initiatives that year, up from 115m in 2014. At the moment, 23 of Apple's tech employees are women. At Google, it's 19. And at Facebook, just 17. Change comes slowly in companies of this size, so the path could be a long one. But by broadening the pool of people qualified to work there, Silicon Valley is hoping to change the status quo.",

        "By the time a baby takes its first breath many of the key pathways between nerves have already been made. And some of these will help determine how a baby thinks or sees the world, and may have a role to play in the development of conditions such as autism, scientists say. But how this rich neural network assembles in the baby before birth is relatively unchartered territory. Researchers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, King's College London, Imperial College and Oxford University aim to produce a dynamic wiring diagram of how the brain grows, at a level of detail that they say has been impossible until now. They hope that by charting the journeys of bundles of nerves in the final three months of pregnancy, doctors will be able to understand more about how they can help in situations when this process goes wrong. Prof David Edwards, director of the Centre for the Developing Brain, who is leading the research, says: \"There is a distressing number of children in our society who grow up with problems because of things that happen to them around the time of birth or just before birth. \"It is very important to be able to scan babies before they are born, because we can capture a period when an awful lot is changing inside the brain, and it is a time when a great many of the things that might be going wrong do seem to be going wrong.\" The study - known as the Developing Human Connectome Project - hopes to look at more than 1,500 babies, studying many aspects of their neurological development. By examining the brains of babies while they are still growing in the womb, as well as those born prematurely and at full term, the scientists will try to define baselines of normal development and investigate how these may be affected by problems around birth. And they plan to share their map with the wider research community. Central to this project are advanced MRI scanning techniques, which the scientists say are able to pick up on details of the growing brain that have been difficult to capture until now. While in the womb, foetuses are free to somersault in their amniotic sacs, and this constant movement has so far hindered clear images of growing brains. But researchers at the Centre for the Developing Brain have found ways to counter the effects of these movements, building up full three-dimensional pictures while the foetus is in motion. And by placing the MRI machine in the neonatal intensive care unit at Evelina Children's Hospital in London they are one of the few centres in the world to have a scanner in such close proximity to the babies who often need it most, Prof Edwards says. This means the same scanning system can be used to find out more about the brains of the sickest and smallest newborn babies, he says. Daniel Rueckert, professor of visual information processing at Imperial College London, who is also involved in the research, says: \"We are trying to look at brain connectivity in two ways: firstly, from a structural perspective, to find out which parts of the brain are wired to other parts. And secondly we are looking at functional connectivity - how strongly two brain regions are linked across time and activity.\" But Prof Partha Mitra, a neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York state, says we need to be aware of the limitations of the technology in use. \"It would obviously be a very good thing to know more about the circuits in the developing human brain. Much of what we know hasn't changed in a hundred years and has come from dissection studies. \"But we need to keep in mind the imaging techniques we have are indirect - we can't open up a human brain and look at the connections while someone is alive so we rely on these non-invasive methods. But there is a big gap between the real circuits in the brain and what images can show us.\" Prof Rueckert acknowledges that this map will provide a \"macro-level\" view of the developing brain and not be the \"final answer.\" But he points to early results from the adult version of this project - the Human Connectome Project, based in the US: \"There is so much evidence already from the adult project that there are significant changes in the brain that can be mapped with the technology we have now. \"It will be incredibly useful to be able to do this with the still growing and developing brain - perhaps giving us more time to intervene when things go wrong.\"",

Depp, they claim, is \"fully responsible for any financial turmoil\" he faces. \"He has refused to live within his means, despite.... repeated warnings about his financial condition,\" their countersuit claims. Their legal action, obtained by the Deadline website, also accuses the actor of spending: Last month, Depp claimed The Management Group owed him more than 25m. His lawsuit also alleges the company failed to file him taxes on time, costing him 5.7m (PS4.5m) in penalties. Depp's latest legal tussle comes in the wake of his divorce to Amber Heard, which was finalised in January after months of wrangling.

        "Adrian Evans, 44, from Tipton, died along with his father, Patrick Evans, 78, and nephew Joel Richards, 19, from Wednesbury. All three men were Walsall FC fans. At least 30 Britons were among 38 people killed when a student linked to Islamic State extremists opened fire on a beach in Sousse on Friday. Adrian Evans worked for Sandwell Council as a manager in the gas services department. His nephew, Walsall season-ticket holder Joel, was a football referee and student at the University of Worcester. His brother, Owen Richards, 16, survived the attack. Prime Minister David Cameron has led tributes in Parliament to the family. \"It is absolutely heartbreaking,\" he said. \"All of us have read about it in the newspapers and I know how the family and the community will be affected for many years to come.\" A GoFundMe page set-up to support the family has raised more than PS3,300. Sandwell Council is inviting people to pay their respects in two books of condolence. One is in the Sandwell Homes office where Adrian worked, in Roway Lane in Oldbury, and the other in the foyer at the council house in Freeth Street, Oldbury. Colleague Mark Peniket said his death was a \"real, real shock.\" \"Adrian will be a great loss both personally and in his working life,\" he said. \"He was such a popular person.\" A statement from St Mary's Primary School in Wednesbury, where Joel was a former pupil and returned as a volunteer, said he was a fantastic role model, \"bright, enthusiastic, aspirational and always smiling.\" \"Joel was an intelligent, radiant and compassionate young man who had the world at his feet and everything to live for,\" the statement said. \"The staff at St Mary's are heartbroken at the tragic loss of his life and the lives of his uncle and grandfather. \"We would like to offer our prayers and sympathy to his parents, grandmother and brother Owen who survived the attack. \"There are no words that could possibly do justice to this wonderful young man. We were proud to have known him.\" Professor David Green, vice chancellor of the University of Worcester, described Joel as a \"first class student\" and was \"the son everybody would want to have.\" Walsall FC changed the main image on its social media accounts to a photograph showing the three outside Wembley Stadium at the Saddlers' Johnstone's Paint Trophy final appearance three months ago. In a statement the club said it would do everything it could to support the family. \"It is at times like this when the football family really comes together and we have been overwhelmed by the messages of condolence that we have received from all around the world,\" it said. \"That iconic image of the three men, along with Owen, enjoying our first-ever appearance at Wembley Stadium in March resonates with us all. \"It was a special moment that we all enjoyed together and now at this most devastating of times, we join together to offer strength and support.\"",
        "Overall, increased by 0.1 to 43.1, after decades of decline. Belgium, where voting is compulsory, recorded 90 attendance while Slovaks showed the least enthusiasm - just 13 turned out. The centre-right EPP is set to take the largest share of the seats, with an estimated 208 - against 186 for the centre-left SD bloc. The EPP choice for president of the European Commission, former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, has already claimed the post for himself, despite opposition from the UK's ruling Conservative Party. Soundbite: \"I don't care. I'm not on my knees. I won the election\" - former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, speaking about his critics. The two big upsets of the elections are the far right coming first in France and Eurosceptics taking top spot in the UK. In France, the National Front overcame its pariah status to win 24 seats, coming first in about 70 of the country's regions. The centre-right opposition UMP saw its share of seats shrink from 29 to 20, prompting party leader Jean-Francois Cope to announce his resignation in the autumn. The UMP has been dogged by a party funding scandal. Meanwhile, the ruling Socialists lost only one seat, but remained with a meagre tally of 13. President Francois Hollande reacted by calling on the EU to reform and scale back its power, The UK Independence Party (UKIP) had 27.5 of the vote and 24 MEPs in the UK. The opposition Labour Party, on 25, narrowly beat the ruling Conservatives to take second place. It was the first time in over a century that a national vote had not been won by either the Conservatives or Labour. Soundbite: \"They [the people] no longer want to be led by those outside our borders, by EU commissioners and technocrats who are unelected\" - Marine Le Pen, leader of French National Front. Parties of the radical left did well in the crisis-hit southern states of the eurozone but in Greece the far right continued to build support. Defying opinion polls which forecast a single seat, Spain's new Podemos party, which has its roots in the indignado movement, won five seats and nearly 8 of the vote, coming fourth just behind the former communists. The ruling centre-right Popular Party remained in front but took heavy losses along with the opposition Socialists, the two parties losing eight and nine seats respectively. In Greece, the far-left Syriza coalition came first with 26.6 (six seats) while the ruling conservative New Democracy party took 22.8 (five seats). But Golden Dawn, the far-right party whose leaders are under criminal investigation, came third with 9.4 and three seats. After three years of austerity in Portugal, the opposition Socialists took the lead with 31.5 of the vote and eight seats, against 27.7 and seven seats for the ruling coalition of social democrat and centre-right parties. In the Republic of Ireland, Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army militant group and a Syriza ally, won three seats - one short of Fine Gael, the senior party in the ruling coalition. The leader of the Labour Party, the coalition's junior partner, announced he was resigning. Eamon Gilmore's party failed to win any seats. Soundbite: \"We can't talk about the end, but we can talk about the beginning of the end of [the two-party system - Pablo Iglesias, leader of Podemos. The surprise of the night for many was how the centre-left Democratic Party in the ruling coalition built itself a handsome lead, ending with nearly 41 of the vote and 31 seats. Beppe Grillo's Eurosceptic Five Star Movement came second with 21 and 17 seats, doing worse than at the national election last year. The Forza Italia party of disgraced former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi came third with 16.8 and 13 seats. Soundbite: \"Italy now has the task of showing that is a leader, not a follower, in Europe\" - Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. The importance of the European elections in Belgium was eclipsed by the general election, in which Flemish nationalists came first. Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, a Socialist from the French-speaking part of the country, resigned. Mr Di Rupo had led his coalition government for two-and-a-half years, following a record period of 541 days when the country was without a government. In a surprise result, the Eurosceptic Freedom Party of Geert Wilders fell from second place to fourth in the Netherlands, but still won three seats. The Dutch also returned one MEP for the Party for the Animals for the first time. Soundbite: \"The Dutch have drawn the conclusion that the European Union means strength and extreme nationalism is a danger\" - former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt. Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right CDUCSU consolidated its lead at 35.3, while its junior partner in coalition, the Social Democrats, also got good news when it raised its share of the vote from 20.8 in 2009 to 27.3 this year. There will be two German newcomers in the European Parliament: the anti-euro Alternative for Germany, with seven seats, and the far-right National Democratic Party, with one seat. Soundbite: \"We won't work with right-wing populists\" - Bernd Lucke, leader of Alternative for Germany. The anti-immigration People's Party came first in Denmark with four seats and nearly 27 of the vote. It distanced itself from the National Front in France and Golden Dawn in Greece. Correspondents say the party's success may put pressure on the ruling coalition to harden its own policies. Sweden elected its first MEP from what is said to be the only formal feminist party in the European Parliament, the Feminist Initiative. It campaigned under the slogan, \"Out With Racists And In With Feminists.\" Meanwhile, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats won nearly 10 and two seats. Finland's Eurosceptic True Finns Party won two seats and nearly 13 of the vote, falling well short of forecasts. Soundbite: \"It's deplorable that parties like Le Pen's National Front and Golden Dawn gain ground, but they do [so] because the established parties let the Europeans down\" - Morten Messerschmidt, member of the Danish People's Party. Poland, which has the largest number of seats among the newer EU states (51), saw a tie in the number of seats won by the governing Civic Platform party and opposition Law and Justice party - 19 each. In Hungary, the conservative Fidesz party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban did even better than at the general election last month, going from 45 to 51.5 and winning 12 seats. The far-right Jobbik party won three seats again but its share of the vote fell from 21 in April to just under 15. Political instability continued in Bulgaria where the conservative opposition party Gerb, ousted last year after street protests, bested the ruling Socialists, winning 30.5 to 19. Soundbite: \"Now go to Europe and never forget that Hungary comes number one. If we remember that, we can be great again\" - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Lithuania's elections were dominated by the run-off round of its presidential election, won convincingly by incumbent Dalia Grybauskaite who stood on an anti-Kremlin platform, warning of the threat posed by the current Russian leadership. Soundbite: \"We are in a vortex of threats today\" - Dalia Grybauskaite, speaking just before the election.",

        "Oliver Schmidt, a former head of VW's engineering and environmental office in the US, admitted to participating in an attempted cover-up after regulators raised questions the \"defeat devices.\" He faces up to seven years in prison, and up to 400,000 (PS306,000) in fines. The scandal has cost Volkswagen as much as 25bn. US prosecutors say Volkswagen installed special software in certain diesel vehicles that allowed them to perform better during emissions tests than they did under normal driving conditions. The emissions were sometimes 30 times higher than permitted under US rules. Volkwagen sold almost 600,000 vehicles with the devices in the US between 2006 and 2015, and about 11 million globally. The allegations have also prompted probes in other countries. Volkswagen: The scandal explained VW papers shed light on emissions scandal Diesel cars: What's all the fuss about? Mr Schmidt was informed that the devices had been installed in 2015, after a nonprofit in the US exposed discrepancies and regulators confronted the company, according to court filings. Mr Schmidt, who was arrested while travelling in Miami, was one of six people charged related to the scheme in January. The others live in Germany. The US also charged a former manager at Audi - which is part of Volkswagen - in July. A Volkswagen engineer last year pleaded guilty on related charges. His sentencing is expected later this month. Mr Schmidt, who admitted to conspiring to defraud the US and violating the Clear Air Act, is scheduled to be sentenced in December. In exchange for Ms Schmidt's guilty plea, US prosecutors dropped a charge of wire fraud. Mr Schmidt also agreed to deportation after his release. Volkswagen has agreed to pay more than 4bn in fines in the US and to spend up to 25bn to satisfy claims from owners and others. The emissions scandal in the US contributed to a wider backlash against diesel-powered cars, which were once believed to be more environmentally friendly. Four major cities have moved to ban such vehicles by 2025. Volkswagen was also recently accused of teaming up with other carmakers in a breach of EU cartel rules.",
        "Except that it's not your conventional image of what a lecture might look like. No-one's sitting down, or taking notes - not to start with at least. Instead they are all gathered around various whiteboards, participating in an activity about stereotypes and prejudices and how they get in the way of a productive working environment. It's just one of the ways SMU says it's trying to get its mainly Singaporean student population ready for work. \"The Singaporean students that I teach are very well-prepared for the post-graduation workplace,\" says Dr Hoon Chang Yau, Assistant Professor of Asian Studies at SMU. \"They're very strategic about finding a job and very pragmatic too. \"They want a job with security so they'll look for work in a multinational corporation or a bank.\" Singapore graduates are amongst the most ambitious in Asia when it comes to job and salary prospects. According to a recent poll of 200 students by Singapore employment website STJobs, 70 of all graduates surveyed expect a starting salary of up to 4,000 SGD (PS1,800) a month at the very least. In reality though, a starting salary for a young graduate is closer to a little more than half that amount. But recent concerns over the outlook for emerging markets and how much of an impact the slowdown in China will have on Singapore's fortunes are being felt here. Economic growth forecasts for Singapore have been slashed in the wake of a weakening global economy. DBS Bank and international ratings agency Moody's are among those to have cut their outlook for Singapore's GDP to below 2. The official range forecast by the government is 2 to 2.5. \"I have seen that the graduate employment rate has been going on a downward trend,\" says Sim Cher Young, director of the career centre at SMU. \"In many ways, with the weakening economy, the sentiment amongst some employers is this:'My business is not picking up and I'll downgrade all my business strategies' and a lot of employers are a lot more cautious, which is translating to their hiring.\" This environment means that young Singaporeans are now under pressure to become more competitive, or start looking at different ways to make a living. Increasingly, starting a business has become an option for some graduates. But Singapore's education system has been criticised for not being well-rounded enough to create entrepreneurs. While the academic system here is praised around the world for its rigour, there are concerns that there's not enough of a focus on problem solving, or real life experiences that are essential to be a successful entrepreneur. That's what Roshni Mahtani believes. The founder and CEO of Tickled Media, a content and community company for parents in Asia, launched her homegrown Singaporean start-up \"theAsianParent\" in 2009. At the time she was one of the first few local start-ups on the scene, and faced a lot of scepticism about her prospects. \"As a Singaporean who has gone through the education system here, I definitely do not believe that we get the skills we need to become entrepreneurs,\" says Ms Mahtani. \"You need to be a risk taker to be an entrepreneur, and our schools didn't prioritise that.\" Ms Mahtani was not unaware of the consequences of rebelling in the strict Singapore school system. \"I was constantly in detention in school and high school,\" she adds. \"I received 50 or 60 detention slips and I just didn't go. \"And this wasn't because of academics. It was because they thought I was always breaking the rules - not returning library books, questioning the teachers.\" Ms Mahtani says that it was also hard to convince her friends and family entrepreneurship was the right path for her. \"It's the mindset here,\" she told me. \"Many people said to me:'Why are you doing this, why don't you do a job instead of this?'. But I knew, I wanted to start my own business and I never gave up.\" Back on the lecture floor, final year students discuss their job prospects with me. Some are aiming for the professions. \"When I was younger, before I became a law student, I remember I wanted to be a fish-feeder at an aquatics centre,\" said Kim Shi Yin. \"But then my parents said:'Are you crazy, what are you going to eat at night?' So I studied law instead.\" Damian Joseph Teo is more optimistic about the prospects for successful entrepreneurial culture in Singapore. He has been interning as a dolphin trainer - a unique job in this straitlaced society. \"Some of my friends who are working - they're all waiting to save up their money and start their own businesses,\" he said. \"They don't want to be billionaires, but they want to start something on their own and have the guts to do it.\" Sliv Chua Tze Yee agrees. \"While I think a large portion of our students will still choose careers that are more predictable, I think that students are now taking more risks,\" he said. \"We aren't venture capitalists or anything like that yet - but we are taking more risks and becoming more innovative in our choice of careers.\" The BBC contacted Singapore's Ministry of Education for a comment on this story, but never received one.",
        "Sue Sim was the first woman to lead the force and led the hunt for murderer Raoul Moat in 2010. Last month Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird launched an investigation into Ms Sim over alleged rudeness to staff. Ms Sim is retiring on 3 June to spend more time with her family to \"make up for the sacrifices\" they made. She joined Merseyside Police in 1985, progressing through the ranks before moving to Northumbria in 2004. Ms Sim said the hunt for Moat following the murder of Christopher Brown and shooting of one of her officers, PC David Rathband, was one of the biggest challenges she faced. She said: \"That was the largest manhunt the country has seen for 44 years. I spent my time out and about reassuring the public and responding to their questions. \"I am immensely proud of my officers and staff who went about their roles fully aware of the threats against them, but determined to support the public.\" She has also overseen savings of PS117m since 2010 and was at the helm as Northumbria Police reopened no crime rape reports following an audit. Ms Baird's office said the misconduct investigation will continue but admitted if the complaints against her were upheld, Ms Sim's retirement would mean any sanctions, such as a written warning, would have no impact. Ms Baird said: \"Sue has brought passion and enthusiasm to her role and leaves at a time when Northumbria is one of the highest performing forces in the country.\"",
        "Karam Chand was born in a small rural village in the Punjab in northern India in 1905. His family worked in farming and, in keeping with the custom of the time, he married at a young age. His bride Kartari was born in the same district in 1912. According to their passports, that currently makes Mr Chand 106 and his wife 99 years old. They wed in a typical Sikh ceremony in December 1925 and have just celebrated their 86th year together as a married couple, which they think may qualify them as the UK's longest married husband and wife. Mr Chand, who came with his family to Bradford in 1965, said there was no real secret to living a long married life. \"Eat and drink what you want but in moderation. I have never held back from enjoying my life,\" he said. Mr Chand smokes one cigarette a day before his evening meal and also drinks a tot of whiskey or brandy three or four times a week. His daughter-in-law Rani said it was something he looked forward to. The couple have eight children, 27 grandchildren and 23 great grandchildren. Many Asian people in the UK live within traditional extended families and the Chands are no exception. They live with their youngest son Satpal, together with his wife and two of their four children. \"We really feel blessed that our parents are still here with us and every day is a bonus,\" Satpal said. \"I think that keeping the minds of older people active is the key to them staying alert and healthy. \"If you have been given the privilege to look after your parents you must involve them fully in family life and never get angry with them, keep them happy and they will then look forward to getting up the next morning.\" Kartari Chand is looking forward to getting a letter from The Queen later this year when she celebrates her 100th birthday, but is more cautious about staying fit and healthy. \"We have always eaten good wholesome food, there's nothing artificial in our diet but things like ghee (clarified butter), milk and fresh yogurt are what we like. \"We know that being married for 86 years is a blessing, but equally we will be ready to go when it's time, it's all up to the will of God, but we really have lived a good life.\" Mrs Chand said that she and her husband enjoyed doing many things, such as eating meals together and going to the temple. However, she said some aspects of old age were difficult. \"My eldest son died and that was hard for us because you don't expect to outlive your own children. \"We have seen many other close family members depart and that's something we just have to live with.\" Mr Chand is now unable to walk any distance without assistance and needs a lot more care than his wife, who remains active and still has her own teeth. She said: \"When you get so old your eyesight and hearing starts to get weaker and you ache more when moving about. \"But considering our age and the hard work we have undertaken during our lives, we're not doing so bad.\" Satpal Chand said he was not sure if his parents were the longest married couple in the UK, but would like to think that they are. \"Breaking records is not so important to us, it's all about living together as one family and respecting each other's values. \"if my mother and father are record breakers then they've made us even more proud of them than we already are.\" \"They're such lovely people.\" You can hear more on Asian Network Reports on the BBC Asian Network.",

The Post Office said despite the walkout it would be \"business as usual\" with \"at least\" 97 of its 11,600 branches not involved. Crown Post Offices are the larger branches that are usually located in High Streets. In April 2016, the Post Office announced plans to transfer up to 61 branches into WH Smith stores over the following year. It said the move was part of a 10-year plan to cut costs and save cash, and would act as a way of \"safeguarding the future of the network.\" \"Our members want the Post Office management to pause its closure and privatisation programme, hold off on its planned pensions changes, and commit to sitting down with us and with the other key stakeholders of this Great British institution and, together, construct a lasting vision,\" said CWU assistant secretary Andy Furey.

        "According to a statement released by the other two members of the band, the singer and guitarist had left \"indefinitely.\" In an interview with Rolling Stone, drummer Travis Barker and bassist Mark Hoppus described complications with writing and recording a new album. However, DeLonge posted \"to all the fans, I never quit the band\" on Instagram. He continued: \"I was actually on a phone call about a Blink 182 event for New York City when all these weird press releases started coming in. \"Apparently those reports were'sanctioned' from the band. Are we dysfunctional - yes. But, Christ. Awkward.\" A poster for an upcoming Blink 182 show at an event organised by Travis Barker suggests the guitarist would be replaced by Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba. Many of DeLonge's recent posts on Twitter consist of promotion for his other band, Angels Airwaves, with several links to their the latest album The Dream Walker. Last summer he performed with Blink 182 in their headline set at Reading and Leeds Festivals. According to his bandmates, the guitarist's manager sent an e-mail which said: \"Tom. Is.

        "The Medical Research Council team showed severely damaged organs in mice could be restored to near-normal function. They say the findings, published in Nature Cell Biology, could eventually help people stuck on a waiting list for a transplant. Further tests are now taking place with human tissue. The liver does have a remarkable ability to heal itself. Even if half of the organ is removed, it can grow back. The team, based at the University of Edinburgh, has been investigating the regenerative potential of the liver. Normally, the main type of cell in the liver - hepatocytes - is able to restore the organ. But one of the researchers, Prof Stuart Forbes, said: \"The hepatocytes normally divide beautifully, but eventually they give up that ability to keep dividing, they become senescent, and that is something we see in all forms of severe liver injury.\" So the Edinburgh team turned to a closely related group of stem cells from the biliary duct. Injecting these cells into damaged mouse livers led to near compete regeneration. Prof Forbes added: \"The big aim would be to develop a clinically applicable cell therapy for patients with severe liver failure where transplantation is not an option.\" The team say tissue from livers unsuitable for transplant could be a source of these cells. However, Prof Forbes said liver transplants would remain the main option for patients and encouraged people to join the donor register. Further studies will now focus on repeating the results with human tissue. Dr Rob Buckle, the director of science programmes at the Medical Research Council, said: \"This research has the potential to revolutionise patient care by finding ways of co-opting the body's own resources to repair or replace damaged or diseased tissue.\"",
        "The girl, aged 15 at the time, had met a man called David Ayrton in a Portsmouth garage in the autumn of 2004. The defendant, now 34 and called Davina, denied the charge. She will be sentenced on 4 March. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody and said it was likely she would be held at a male prison. He added: \"If I were to release on bail there are substantial grounds to believe she would be a risk to herself and a risk of failing to attend for whatever reason. \"I will therefore have to remand in custody. It will have to be a male prison in Winchester but it will be an issue for the prison service.\" He also told the jury at Portsmouth Crown Court: \"It's been a slightly unusual case and it's not been an easy case.\" The court heard that Ayrton, who has learning difficulties, attempted to commit suicide last summer. Protocols have been put in place for her detention at the prison, a court officer explained. During the trial Ayrton spoke about her sexuality, and said she she had not \"made any physical changes or enhancements\" to her body or taken any medication. She changed her name in 2012. Portsmouth Crown Court was told she raped the teenager while two others were asleep in the garage. The victim said she shouted and swore at Ayrton to stop the attack, but her friends had not woken up. She had \"only drunk a can and a half of Foster's\" and clearly recollected the events. The court heard that in 2014 Ayrton told a worker at the care home where she lived in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, about the attack.",

        "Special Report: The Technology of Business Selling globally is child's play Hi-tech start-ups aim for the stars Powering up firms with hi-tech cash Windows XP end puts firms in a fix Does success lie up in the clouds? There you are thinking all your online customer data is safe, thanks to popular open-source encryption software called OpenSSL, and it turns out to be anything but. This small vulnerability has potentially compromised two-thirds of all websites. \"The main worry is for small e-commerce sites that do not know they have been affected,\" says Keith Cottenden, director at cybersecurity specialists CY4OR. \"Any business that takes customer details could be vulnerable because this encryption is designed to protect personal data... Businesses need to apply mitigation now.\" But finding effective and affordable ways to keep \"mission critical\" data safe from hackers, fraudsters and natural disasters can be a daunting and difficult task for small firms. Poor data security can literally ruin your business. For example, weak security measures and alleged poor infrastructure brought Japanese Bitcoin exchange MtGox to its knees before it eventually went bust. The exchange, which was handling about 70 of the world's bitcoin trades at its height, said 850,000 of the digital currency coins were stolen by hackers. The company was forced to file for bankruptcy in February. But in March, MtGox then said it had found 200,000 \"lost\" bitcoins - worth about PS70m - in an old digital wallet dating from 2011. When security is your business, such laxity is obviously disastrous. The UK's Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) believes unchecked cybercrime is severely stunting the growth potential of its members. Source: Federation of Small Businesses The risk of fraud and online crime, both real and perceived, is costing each UK small business up to PS4,000 per year, the FSB says, while cybercrime as a whole costs the UK economy an estimated PS27bn a year. About a third of FSB members have been victims of online crime over the last year, whether from virus infections, hacking attacks or other system security breaches. As well as the financial loss and inconvenience, there is the potentially disastrous loss of customer trust. Despite the critical importance of data security, many businesses appear almost oblivious to the risks. A 2013 survey by security software firm AVG revealed that a large amount of data loss occurs simply due to human error and carelessness. It seems many businesses are more concerned with tidying their desks or ordering new business cards than backing up data. A reported 43 of UK and 53 of US small businesses said they spend more time changing passwords than backing up. And about a quarter of them leave longer than a week between back-ups. \"Too many times an act of carelessness or a security breach has led to information going missing, and in some cases businesses have found themselves in a position where the data is non-recoverable,\" a Microsoft spokesman told the BBC. Natural disasters can pose just as big a risk to small firms as cybercrime. An estimated 25 of businesses do not reopen following a major disaster, according to the Institute for Business and Home Safety, a not-for-profit organisation. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy destroyed thousands of small businesses in the US, while many others still felt the effects at least a year after the event. Rob Cotton, chief executive of Manchester-based NCC Group, a data security firm, told the BBC that adapting good security practices can be difficult for small businesses. \"SMEs that are using their own IT services in-house need to consider the physical security of the equipment, as well as whether the IT is vulnerable to external threats,\" he says. \"It's also important to consider the risk from your own staff, since many incidents result from rogue employees - the so-called'insider threat'.\" A common piece of advice is to back up data securely and often, but should this be to locally stored servers or to remote cloud services? \"Cloud providers will generally be more proactive in terms of ensuring software is up-to-date and maintaining patch levels,\" says Mr Cotton. \"They will also have better security knowledge and awareness, meaning servers and services will generally be well configured. On top of this they are more resilient and most will have robust disaster recovery and continuity plans in place.\" Another advantage of the cloud is that thieves won't necessarily know which service your business uses or where it keeps its servers. But Mr Cotton admits there are certainly risks around adopting cloud services. One obvious one - often overlooked - is that the provider itself suffers a break in service or a breach of its defences, so it makes sense to interrogate the reputation and reliability of any cloud service provider very closely. \"Putting business-critical information in the hands of a third party demands a degree of trust,\" said a Microsoft spokesman. \"Solid providers will explain their security methodologies and commitment to the business.\" That said, a \"belt-and-braces\" local back-up plan may be a good idea. Small firms need to protect their data against viruses, malware and natural disasters, as well as disgruntled or careless employees. But how defences against these threats are implemented will depend upon the circumstances and nature of each business, experts say. In finance, keeping all your eggs in one basket is rarely a wise idea, and the same applies to data. So for maximum security, spreading data around both traditional and non-traditional services seems to be the best policy. Perhaps most importantly, the FSB stresses the need for education. If your managers and employees don't appreciate the need to protect data, the whole future of your business could be on the line.",

A patient safety charity welcomed the moves but said it remained \"concerned.\" The first annual \"learning from mistakes league\" uses feedback from staff on their freedom to speak when things go wrong. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is hosting a \"global patient safety summit\" in London on Wednesday and Thursday, said the changes were a step towards a \"new era of openness.\" He said health services must \"unshackle ourselves from a quick-fix blame culture and acknowledge that sometimes bad mistakes can be made by good people.\" The changes announced by Mr Hunt include: Peter Walsh, chief executive of patient safety charity Action Against Medical Accidents, welcomed the initiatives but said he remained concerned about the \"woeful inconsistency and often inadequate quality of NHS investigations into serious incidents.\" He said there was \"nothing\" in Mr Hunt's announcement to reassure his organisation that urgent action would be taken to address the quality of local investigations. James Titcombe, whose son Joshua died after failings in care, said the measures were \"major steps that will help move the NHS towards the kind of true learning culture that other high-risk industries take for granted.\" Labour's shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said her party supported \"any measures that will improve safety,\" but she added: \"On Jeremy Hunt's watch, hospitals are overcrowded, understaffed and facing financial crisis.\"",
        "The corporation had charged users subscription fees to watch programmes via the app in Western Europe, Australia and Canada. However, it never came to the US. Reports suggest American pay-TV operators had threatened to drop the BBC America channel if the app had launched locally because they believed it would cost them viewers. Both BBC America and the international edition of iPlayer screen some of the corporation's best known programmes, including Doctor Who, Top Gear, Sherlock and David Attenborough's natural history documentaries. Press releases had always described the online facility as a \"pilot\" meant to provide \"consumer insights.\" BBC Worldwide - the broadcaster's commercial arm - first announced it intended to pull support for the Global iPlayer app in October 2013, saying it would instead focus on making material available via the BBC.com website. The corporation repeated the point in its annual review last July, but until now had not provided an exact shut-off date. \"As announced in July 2014, the service will be closing this year as planned,\" said a spokeswoman. \"The service will close on 26 June.\" She declined to provide usage statistics. The global iPlayer app was first made available as an iOS app in July 2011 but was never extended beyond Apple's platform. European users were charged a EUR5.99 (PS4.30) monthly fee, while Canadians and Australians were offered a slightly cheaper rate of 6.99 Canadian dollars (PS3.70) and 7.49 Australian dollars (PS3.80). The content provided was distinct from that offered via the UK version, including older shows from the corporation's library in addition to recently broadcast programmes. In total, more than 2,000 hours of shows were on offer on the global edition of iPlayer, including Gavin and Stacey, Fawlty Towers, Planet Earth and \"classic\" episodes of Doctor Who. Users have been notified of the switch-off, and auto-renewing subscriptions are being cancelled. \"We would like to thank all of our subscribers for using the service. We are now developing plans to launch new digital services across multiple devices,\" reads a statement on BBC Worldwide's site.",
        "23-year-old Mawson arrived at the Liberty Stadium from Championship side Barnsley in August of 2016 and has performed well despite never playing in the first tier before joining the club. Swansea face Everton needing to win as they fight Premier League relegation and Clement believes Mawson's fine form will help in them stay up. \"He can be very good,\" Clement said. He continued: \"He is so young and does not have a lot of experience at this level. You can see there is that rawness about him that really catches the eye, the next moment there is something he should not be doing. \"But he is at the age where he is developing. He has a lot of good attributes, physically, technically and tactically. So he can go on and do really well.\" Mawson has struck up a promising partnership with fellow centre-half Federico Fernandez, much like his predecessor and club captain Ashley Williams. After the departure of Williams to Everton in the summer, the Argentine international suffered a dip of form, but has worked well at the back with Mawson. \"He [Fernandez] has hit some really good form. He was very, very good against Manchester United in his defending,\" said Clement. \"He could do better with the ball at times, but he and Alfie are forming a nice partnership. \"Earlier in the season there were too many goals going in, but they have had a fair share of games now where they have only conceded one goal or kept a clean sheet so that is good.\" With a late kick-off at the Liberty Stadium, the Swans know they could be as much as five points behind the side they are chasing, Hull, when they take to the pitch.

        "It said a detailed, time-bound plan for implementation should be outlined as the move could improve safety and efficiency. A plan for the system has been in place since 2007 but prescribing is still paper-based in Welsh hospitals. The scheme must be in place by 2023, but the WAO wants it brought in sooner. WAO director David Thomas said a number of the NHS staff auditors spoken to cited \"frustration\" that it was taking so long to bring in an electronic prescribing system in Wales. He said implementing one would result in a \"much more effective and efficient system within hospitals.\" The report also looked at other areas of prescribing and found there were some safety issues caused by incomplete medicine information on paper drug charts, including some which did not have information about patients' drug allergies. There were also some instances where notes were unclear about whether patients had received the doses they were due. The report also looked at how new medicines were chosen and although there is a national process for appraising new drugs, it found there were three instances where decisions had been taken outside that process. The WAO would not provide details of the cases, but Mr Thomas said where new drugs are given there needed to be very clear reasons for doing so. The report also found that while NHS Wales was taking steps to improve prescribing in the community, there was scope to further improve quality and costs. It said health bodies were working together well to improve the way medicines are prescribed and managed, and in hospitals, pharmacy services were rated highly by staff. However, auditors highlighted problems with medicine storage and gaps in information about drugs. A Welsh Government spokesman said it was pleased the report recognised there were many good aspects of medicines management in Wales. It added that since last year, it had made good progress on a number of earlier recommendations by the auditor general, and it would respond to the latest advisories shortly. Responding to the report, Nick Ramsay, chairman of the assembly's public accounts committee, said it showed there was \"still much to do to ensure the safe and cost effective use of medicines in Wales.\"",
        "Learning Partnership West runs job clubs, provides mentoring and support and manages adventure playgrounds in a PS3m contract from Bristol City Council. A dozen whistleblowers raised issues including concerns Nicola Burcham's leadership created a \"culture of fear.\" The former CEO, who quit in May 2015, said she had left \"a long time ago\" and refused to comment further. She added the BBC's approach for a comment was \"ridiculous.\" Ms Burcham left almost a month after the whistleblowers approached the council with concerns about her leadership and decision-making. The BBC has spoken to a significant number of former staff, on condition of anonymity. One said: \"She coined the term'freeze and squeeze'. It would start with totally ignoring someone. Then excessive performance management and finally the person would be managed out. \"Appointments were often made with a heavy bias towards black and minority ethnics - particularly young black males.\" Another whistleblower said: \"She had her favourites. You were in and then out quickly. She was the boss. She could do what she liked. You couldn't challenge her.\" While another told the BBC: \"When she was appointed CEO, things changed. There was a culture of fear and bullying from her. She had her favourites. \"No one had a good experience of how they were treated by her. She was not a well-liked woman. She was a very unpleasant woman to work for.\" The council investigated some of their allegations, and said the company was not always acting in the best interests of its clients - young people in need. They found clients from troubled backgrounds were being funnelled into institutions run by Learning Partnership West. Staff at the company were told not to consider other provision. It was also alleged Ms Burcham bullied staff, and recruitment processes at the company were inappropriate - resulting in unfair selection. The chairman of the company commissioned an independent investigation into these allegations, but declined to share the final report. He did say nothing illegal was found. The BBC understands enough people felt bullied that something had to be done. Netta Meadows, service director for Strategic Commissioning in the People directorate of Bristol City Council, said: \"Last year we were made aware of some complaints relating to the management of the service and the council has provided support to investigate these claims. \"The council is confident that Learning Partnership West has responded to the issues.\" A council report obtained by the BBC concluded the company had \"turned a corner\" under new leadership.",
        "Lionel Portillo-Meza pleaded not guilty in the death of Brian Terry in an Arizona court on Wednesday. Weapons found at the scene of his death were linked to a US anti-gun-running scheme called Fast and Furious. Under the programme, the US allowed criminals to purchase guns in order to trace them to major arms traffickers. But US agents lost track of 1,400 of the firearms, including the ones believed to have killed Terry. A US justice department report has cited 14 people for possible disciplinary action for their roles in the programme. Mr Portillo-Meza was arrested in Mexico in 2012. He was flown to the US on Tuesday. He has been charged with murder, as well as assault and other charges. \"This development brings us one step closer to achieving justice for a beloved agent who paid the highest price in protecting this country,\" said US Attorney for Southern California Laura Duffy. \"While there is nothing that can be done to bring Agent Terry home again, we hope this news will bring some level of comfort.\" Another man, Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in February for the 2010 murder, which occurred as Osorio-Arellanes and his gang engaged in a firefight with US border agents in rural Arizona. The US justice department announced a 1m (PS589,000) reward in 2012 for information leading to the arrest of Mr Portillo-Meza, and three others. Two of the men remain fugitives, while the third is waiting in Mexican custody for extradition. Robert Heyer, Terry's cousin and the family's spokesman, said they were \"thankful that Mexican authorities have continued to work with us.\" \"The family has gotten really good at not having high expectations and knowing that things are going to take lots of time,\" Mr Heyer said. \"They have become very patient over the last three-plus years.

That and its multiple missile tests broke existing international sanctions and provoked further measures from the UN and individual countries.

        "Dubbed \"carbon farming,\" researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects. But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices. The research has been published in the journal Earth System Dynamics. Jatropha curcas is a plant that originated in Central America and is very well adapted to harsh conditions including extremely arid deserts. It is already grown as a biofuel in some parts of the world because its seeds can produce oil. In this study, German scientists showed that one hectare of jatropha could capture up to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The researchers based their estimates on trees currently growing in trial plots in Egypt and in the Negev desert. \"The results are overwhelming,\" said Prof Klaus Becker, from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart. \"There was good growth, a good response from these plants. I feel there will be no problem trying it on a much larger scale, for example ten thousand hectares in the beginning,\" he said. According to the researchers a plantation that would cover three percent of the Arabian desert would absorb all the CO2 produced by cars and trucks in Germany over a 20 year period. The scientists say that a critical element of the plan would be the availability of desalination facilities. This means that initially, any plantations would be confined to coastal areas. They are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. Prof Becker says that unlike other schemes that just offset the carbon that people produce, the planting of jatropha could be a good, short term solution to climate change. \"I think it is a good idea because we are really extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - and it is completely different between extracting and preventing.\" According to the scientist's calculations the costs of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees would be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne. This makes it competitive with other techniques, such as the more high tech carbon capture and storage (CCS). A number of countries are currently trialling this technology but it has yet to be deployed commercially. Growing jatropha not only soaks up CO2 but has other benefits. The plants would help to make desert areas more habitable, and the plant's seeds can be harvested for biofuel say the researchers, providing an economic return. \"Jatropha is ideal to be turned into biokerosene - it is even better than biodiesel,\" said Prof Becker. But other experts in this area are not convinced. They point to the fact that in 2007 and 2008 large numbers of jatropha trees were planted for biofuel, especially in Africa. But many of these ventures ended in tears, as the plants were not very successful in coping with dry conditions. Lucy Hurn is the biofuels campaign manager for the charity, Actionaid. She says that while jatropha was once seen as the great, green hope the reality was very different. \"When jatropha was introduced it was seen as a miracle crop, it would grow on scrubland or marginal land,\" she said. \"But there are often people who need marginal land to graze their animals, they are getting food from that area - we wouldn't class the land as marginal.\" She pointed out that jatropha is highly toxic and can pollute the land it is grown on, even in a desert. And she also had concerns about the fairness of the idea. \"It is still somebody else's land. Why go in and grow these massive plantations to deal with a problem these people didn't actually cause?\" Follow Matt on Twitter.",

        "The 18-year-old - making his first appearance of the season - steered home Wayne Rooney's cross to spark wild celebrations on the away bench. Moments earlier, David Meyler had blazed over in a rare Hull attack. But it was a deserved win for United, who had gone close though Rooney, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba. United and Chelsea are now the only Premier League sides with a 100 record from three games, with Manchester City - who have two wins from two games - playing West Ham on Sunday. Relive the late drama at the KCOM Stadium Rashford's winner was the climax to a performance of persistence and intelligence from the visitors, who changed tack several times before eventually breaking down Hull. Ibrahimovic arrived at Old Trafford with a reputation for audacity, but, in the first half, it was his physical size rather than mercurial skill that posed most threat. Offering himself as a constant target in the box, the Swede headed just over the bar in the 10th minute before an extravagant backheel found the side-netting. The excellent Curtis Davies blocked the more direct route to goal after the break, but the guile of Henrikh Mkhitaryan and the pace of fellow substitute Rashford stretched the Hull defence in different directions and, finally, beyond breaking point. A back muscle injury which is likely to rule Marouane Fellaini out for several weeks means United will need to show similar adaptability when they meet Manchester City in their next match With Harry Maguire returning from injury on the bench, former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan had a season-high 14 fit senior professionals available for Hull. But what his squad lacks in numbers, it makes up for in spirit. Alongside Davies, Sam Clucas impressed in midfield, while Adama Diomande and Abel Hernandez chased hard to make something from the few scraps in attack. Before Meyler's late wasted chance, Tom Huddlestone saw a shot deflect just wide with David De Gea hopelessly wrong-footed as they briefly threatened a smash-and-grab victory. But, after wins over Leicester and Swansea in their opening two games, their 100 start to their top-flight campaign is over. The uncertainty over the club's future might also be at an end, however, with vice-chairman Ehab Allam writing in the programme that the match could be his family's last as owners, with takeover talks with a Chinese consortium well advanced. That deal may free up funds to supplement the Tigers' threadbare squad - Tottenham's Ryan Mason is a target - and help them continue to defy the Premier League's usual rules of gravity.

        "The 1,905 claimants had alleged they suffered harm while being held on PNG's Manus Island between 2012 and 2016. The government said it \"strongly denied\" the allegations but that settling was a \"prudent\" decision. Australia turns away any refugees and asylum seekers arriving by boat and sends them to PNG and Nauru. It says this deters migrants from attempting the life-threatening voyage to its shores in trafficking boats. But the policy has been heavily criticised both at home and internationally, including by the United Nations. The Manus case was due to be heard in the Victoria Supreme Court on Wednesday. But shortly before the trial began, lawyers for the claimants said the government and its service providers had offered a last minute settlement of A70m. They also offered to cover costs estimated to be more than A20m. The full details of the settlement and the financial package are yet to be fully approved by the court. Despite the millions of dollars it has cost, and the critical headlines it has generated, the Australian government is unlikely to regret its policy of sending asylum seekers offshore. Telling refugees that they will not be allowed to enter Australia until their case has been processed seems to have been a powerful deterrent. Just yesterday the prime minister boasted that more than 1,000 days had passed without a successful people-smuggling expedition to Australia. The more pressing problem is what to do with the hundreds of refugees who remain on Manus Island and Nauru. While the US has agreed to honour a deal to consider them for resettlement, it seems unlikely that all would pass the \"extreme vetting\" procedure. And with the Manus Island centre due to close in October, time is running out for a long-term solution. The principal lawyer for the claimants, Andrew Baker, said the settlement would help them to \"put this dark chapter of their lives behind them.\" But Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said the government \"strongly refutes and denies the claims made in these proceedings.\" In a statement, he said that had the case gone to trial it would have cost \"tens of millions of dollars in legal fees alone, with an unknown outcome,\" and the government decided a settlement was a \"prudent outcome for Australian taxpayers.\" As of last year, residents were allowed to freely come and go from the facility but the debate over their resettlement is ongoing. Australia has insisted that no-one held on Manus or Nauru will ever be re-settled in Australia.",
        "Eric Bikubi, 28, and his partner Magalie Bamu, aged 29, have been convicted at the Old Bailey of killing Kristy Bamu after accusing him of being a sorcerer who practised witchcraft. The couple, who live in Newham, acted after accusing Kristy of controlling and adversely influencing a young boy, the jury was told. They originally came from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where witchcraft is called Kindoki, and exorcisms are carried out in some churches. In 2010, Unicef reported 20,000 children accused of witchcraft were living on the streets of DR Congo's capital Kinshasa. In the DR Congo, accusing a child of being possessed is a criminal offence, a law that has been in place for several years. But in 2008 I travelled to Kinshasa to see if it was making any difference and, at that time, the answer was not at all. Which is why I found myself in one of the city's slums late at night knocking on the door of tin-roofed shack that doubled as a church. Pastor Tsimba let me in and showed me three children who he had diagnosed as having Kindoki. The youngest was probably six, the oldest no more than 12. They had been in the church for days, deprived of food and forced to work. Their parents were paying for the privilege. The only light came from flickering candles and storm lamps. The pastor began to shout and pray. One by one he brought the children up to the front of the church. He ordered them to lie down and, still shouting and chanting, began slapping their stomachs, one, two, three times. Each harder than the last. Then he took a candle and poured burning hot wax on them, leaving them grimacing and squirming but making almost no sound. Their eyes were wide and staring. Finally, as a bizarre conclusion to the ritual, Pastor Tsimba produced a length of pipe and held it hard against their belly buttons. One after another, he made a play of sucking hard on the pipe and in triumph then spat a lump of meat he claimed to have sucked out of them into a bowl. The meat he claimed had been been fed to them by a witch, infecting them with Kindoki. The children, bewildered and quiet, were now in his words \"delivered.\" I alerted a social worker to the plight of the children. An extraordinary and dedicated man, he said he would do all he could to help them. But his unit had not paid him for months, there was no money for petrol or even a bus fare. So he did his work on foot. He walked miles each day, visiting as many churches as he could, in this sprawling city of nine million people.",

        "A Fabian Society report said the party was \"too weak\" to take power without support from other parties. Ms Stevens said Labour could win if it was \"bold and credible and radical enough\" in its manifesto and policies. Welsh Labour vice-chair Mike Payne said UK leader Jeremy Corbyn had \"failed to make the impact\" allies predicted, but Carwyn Jones in Wales was trusted more. The report claimed that Labour was set to win fewer than 200 seats whether an election took place in 2017 or 2020, and even if its poll ratings improved would still have \"no chance\" of winning a majority. Ms Stevens, the MP for Cardiff Central, rejected the study's claim that Labour could only take power at Westminster with the backing of other parties. \"If Labour is bold and credible and radical enough in the manifesto and the policies it puts to the country, then Labour can beat the Tories by itself,\" she said. \"Obviously the polls at the moment aren't suggesting that, but if we don't have an election until 2020 who knows what's going to happen between now and then. \"Look at what happened last year. Politics is very unpredictable at the moment.\" Ms Stevens dismissed the idea of a \"progressive alliance\" of parties that could include Labour. \"Minor parties would want to work with Labour because they think that Labour won't stand candidates in very few areas where there's a possibility a minor party might win a seat,\" she said. \"When it comes to the other way around - minor parties not standing candidates so Labour can stand and win - those minor parties don't stick to their side of the bargain. \"As someone who beat a Lib Dem sitting MP in a marginal seat in the general election in 2015 I've no interest at all, and neither have many of my colleagues, in any sort of alliances with the Lib Dems because we saw what they did in coalition government with the Tories. Lib Dem leader] Tim Farron is on record as saying they would go into government with the Tories again. \"So I think it's a complete red herring.\" In Wales, Labour held onto power after the 2016 assembly election by including sole Lib Dem AM Kirsty Williams in the cabinet and striking a deal with Plaid Cymru to support Carwyn Jones as first minister. \"The Welsh dimension is slightly different,\" said Mr Payne, who becomes Welsh Labour chairman in March. Referring to Mr Jones, he added: \"The Welsh Labour brand has a leader that is trusted more than Jeremy Corbyn is trusted. \"At a UK level Jeremy Corbyn has failed to make the impact people were suggesting he would. \"I personally don't see us making any headway while Jeremy Corbyn is leader of the party. \"Even Jeremy Corbyn's staunchest allies are starting to doubt he can win a majority.\" On Sunday, Unite union leader Len McCluskey suggested the Labour leader could step down if the party's poll ratings fail to improve.

        "The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea did, however, allow Ghana to continue developing current oilfields. These include the so called-Ten fields, part owned by UK firm Tullow Oil. Ivory Coast had asked that all drilling be suspended, but the tribunal ruled this would risk \"considerable financial loss\" to Ghana. Instead, it told the West African nation to \"take all necessary steps to ensure than no new drilling either by Ghana or under its control takes place in the disputed area\" and to \"refrain from granting any new permit for oil exploration and exploitation in the disputed area.\" The area is believed to contain large reserves of oil, which both countries are keen to exploit. Pending a ruling on the precise maritime border, the tribunal told both countries to \"pursue co-operation and refrain from any unilateral action that might lead to aggravating the dispute.\" The ruling was welcomed by Tullow Oil, which owns a large stake in the near 5bn (PS3.3bn) Ten project, which could reportedly produce up to 80,000 barrels a day. \"Following this ruling, the Ten project can move ahead and we will now await instructions from the government of Ghana with regard to implementing those provisional measures that have been ordered by [the tribunal],\" a Tullow spokesman said.",
        "She had sought a judicial review over the alleged failure to issue new guidance on abortion to medical professionals in Northern Ireland She claimed the delay compounded the trauma of losing her babies. But on Friday, her lawyers said her goal had been reached as guidelines have now been published. Northern Ireland's abortion law differs from the rest of the UK and access to termination is more restricted. Abortion is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health. The woman who took the case wished to remain anonymous. In 2013, she had to travel to a clinic in England to terminate twins with fatal foetal abnormalities. Staff at a Belfast hospital believed they were unable to carry out the abortion due to uncertainty around the law, according to papers in the case. Last year, she discovered that a second pregnancy was non-viable. On that occasion, however, she was able to have an abortion at another hospital in Belfast. Consultants decided that continuing with the pregnancy could have serious consequences for her mental health. In her challenge, she claimed there was a legitimate expectation that the guidelines would be published in final form. But on Friday, her barrister indicated that the publication of the guidance meant she had secured the relief sought. Her lawyers are now pursuing the costs of her challenge. The long-awaited guidelines are aimed at providing clarification for medical staff on when a termination is legal. The lack of clarity on the issue has been a sticking point for decades, and clinicians have expressed fear that they could face prosecution for carrying out abortions, based on their interpretation of a permanent or serious risk to woman's mental or physical health. The publication of the latest set of abortion guidelines follows years of talks between the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and senior clinicians. It also comes after a series of legal challenges against the current law and a high-profile but unsuccessful campaign to legalise abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.",
        "Fergus Ewing said it meant 16,521 farmers had now received their Common Agricultural Policy payments. The government has been facing pressure to deal with \"failures\" in the subsidies payment system. It emerged on Friday that any fine may be waived and an extension to the deadline no longer required if a 90 target was met. Mr Ewing said: \"As of close of business last night, and subject to final confirmation, we have made BPS, Greener and Young Farmer payments to 16,521 farmers and crofters, valued at PS343m. This represents around 90.4 of expected total payments for those schemes. \"We are awaiting a final determination from the European Commission regarding an extension to the payment deadline to 15 October, if necessary, on the grounds of the acutely challenging delivery and implementation issues we face in Scotland. \"Our payments made to date, along with the national loan scheme mean that the majority of farmers and crofters have received their money.\" He added: \"Over the coming weeks we will be working hard to ensure that we complete the remaining payments due to farmers and crofters as quickly as possible.\" The government has accelerated payments in recent weeks amid political pressure from opposition parties, and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has apologised to farmers for \"failures\" with the system. An extension was granted in 2016, after problems arose with a new PS178m IT system for delivering the payments. Audit Scotland has estimated that fines for missing the deadlines could run to PS60m, and have warned there are still \"significant costs and risks for the Scottish government\" over the IT problems. The latest deadline pressure has sparked a political row at Holyrood, with Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson accusing Mr Ewing and Ms Sturgeon of \"not being straight\" with MSPs and farmers. The first minister said \"rapid daily progress\" was being made in getting payments through, and insisted she and her ministers had been clear with parliament. Mr Ewing described criticism as \"fanciful.\"",
        "The law, which is set to become a world first, aims to close the wage gap between men and women. Companies face auditing and possible fines if they do not comply. Iceland was ranked first in the World Economic Forum's 2015 Global Gender Gap Index, followed by Norway, Finland and Sweden. However, according to Iceland's statistics for the same year, the unadjusted gender pay gap remained at 17. The bill, which was presented on Tuesday, is supported by the centre-right coalition government and the opposition. Applying to both the public and private sector, it would prohibit any discrimination not just on gender, but also on race, religion, disability, occupational disability, age and sexual orientation grounds. \"The bill entails that companies and institutions of a certain size, 25 or more employees, undertake a certification of their equal-pay programmes,\" Thorsteinn Viglundsson, the minister of social affairs and equality, told news agency AFP. The bill will now be subject to a series of debates, and if it passes, it will take effect from January 2018. In Iceland's parliament, nearly 50 of lawmakers are women, and a voluntary measure for equal pay across the country was introduced in 2012. However, many still do not think enough is being done. In October, thousands of women left work early and headed out on to the streets of the capital, Reykjavik, to protest against earning less than men.

This was despite revenue increasing more than five fold to almost PS80m. The club's annual report says support from Malaysian investors \"will continue\" as long as \"the business develops as planned.\" The financial figures showed that the club's broadcasting and commercial income rose from from PS8m to more than PS70m. Wages and salaries went up from just over PS27m to PS46m. During their time in the Premier League Cardiff sacked Malky Mackay and replaced him with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The club said they paid just over PS2m on \"exceptional costs\" relating to the change of football and senior management. The accounts show the club received loans of around PS130m - mainly from Tan, but also including a loan of PS7.5m from Torman Finance, understood to be chairman Mehmet Dalman's company. The report adds: \"Following relegation from the Barclays Premier League the owners are aware that they needed to again invest in strengthening the playing squad, but that they needed to spend wisely. \"Whilst long term funding is not guaranteed, the Malaysian investors have indicated that providing the business develops as planned, they will continue to support the company in the foreseeable future and provide additional finances in order that it can settle its liabilities.\" Tan has previously said he will convert the club's debt into equity.

In an interview with BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier, he said he did not \"want to get into a series of questions unpicking the theology of the Bible.\" But he acknowledged it had \"become an issue,\" and did not want people getting the \"wrong impression\" about his views. \"I don't believe that gay sex is a sin,\" he said. \"I take the view though that as a political leader, my job is not to pontificate on theological matters.\" Mr Farron said that with a general election campaign under way, it was important to be talking about \"big issues\" like health and social care and Brexit. \"I am quite careful about how I talk about my faith. I do not bang on about it, I do not make a secret out of it,\" he said. \"On reflection, it makes sense to actually answer this direct question since it's become an issue.\" He also said the Lib Dems had \"undoubtedly the best record\" on gay rights out of all political parties.

It is backed by the Welsh government and other organisations. It comes as the water company's half year financial report showed a strong overall performance for the six months leading up to September. The non-shareholder company - which says all its gains go to customers - said it invested PS174m in large projects and essential infrastructure in that period - nearly PS1m a day. It also confirmed that a further PS170m will be invested between October 2014 and April 2015. Chief Executive Chris Jones said: \"With all our gains going to customers, we can deliver real value by accelerating investment, keeping bills low and helping those who genuinely struggle to pay their water bills.\" The HelpU tariff has been developed with support from the independent consumer watchdog Consumer Council for Water (CCWater), the Welsh government and housing associations group Community Housing Cymru. It will be targeted at customers spending more than 5 of their income on water bills.

        "In order to assess the important question of whether the big contractors, Serco, G4S, Atos and Capita, are making excessive profits from their PS4bn of annual business with the public sector, the government's spending watchdog had to rely to a great extent on information volunteered to them by the four. Which seems something of a lacuna, given that a huge and rising proportion of our public services are delivered by the private sector. According to the NAO, contracting out, to the likes of Serco, G4S, Atos and Capita, accounts for \"around half of the PS187bn that the public sector spends on goods and services each year.\" Or to put it another way, contracting out represents around 15 of all public spending and 5 of UK GDP. Private sector delivery of public services is therefore hugely important to the effectiveness of the functioning of the state and to the productivity of the economy. Yet it is only written in to some contracts that they are \"open book,\" that the client (that's you by the way, the taxpayer) has a formal right to know how much money the private company is actually making from a particular contract. So what did the NAO actually learn about the profitability of the big four outsourcing companies from the information they supplied? Well the big four say that in 2012 their respective operating margins - the profits they typically make as a percentage of sales - on government contracts were lower than the operating margin they earn on average on all contracts. So on that basis, if the numbers are reliable, it would be hard to argue that the government is being ripped off. But there are three qualifications to make: 1. They are all making an operating margin on government work in the ballpark of 5, with Capita and Serco apparently generating a smidge more than Atos and G4S. But is there anything magical and appropriate about that 5 number? Now the NAO points out that the net margin for these companies for all their work - for public-sector and private-sector work - is a bit less than the average for FTSE 100 companies. But that may not be a useful comparison. Given the long term nature of the public-sector contracts, and that once they are won they are frequently rolled over and extended, would it be reasonable for the profit margin to be even less? The NAO doesn't seem to have a view on this. 2. There is enormous variation in the profitability of different contracts, which calls into question whether the 5 average return is meaningful. The gross profit margin (the profit before allocating overheads) for Atos on contracts varies between 3 and 22, the range is 6-18 for Capita, it's 0-32 for G4S, and 4-13 for Serco. Again an important question is begged, namely why there is such variation in the profitability of contracts both for individual companies and between companies? Does this variation reflect the different degrees of risk for the contractor in each contract - which would be a reassuring explanation? Or does it imply that there is great variation in the competence of public sector negotiators - which would warm the cockles rather less? Again there is no definitive answer from the NAO. 3. The NAO notes that from 1 January 2006 to 30 September 2013, the value of these businesses on the stock market has risen much more than the value of FTSE 100 companies in general. In that period, the FTSE 100 index increased 26, whereas Capita's share price rose 141 and G4S's 94. That would suggest investors aren't remotely worried that the profitability of government contracts is too slim. Quite the reverse. It implies that the reliability of the revenues from these contracts is what matters, and that therefore the profit margins are quite satisfactory. But, and this is quite important, the story of the relationship between the private-sector providers and the government is - ahem - evolving. Since the 2010 general election, the Cabinet Office has aggressively tried to exercise greater central control over the awarding of outsourcing contracts. In the process, it has obtain substantial refunds on older deals and seems to be securing better value for money on new transactions. More recently the Ministry of Justice has duffed up Serco and G4S, by calling in the Serious Fraud Office to investigate alleged overcharging for electronic tagging of criminals. Or to put it another way, the perceived balance between risk and reward on these outsourced deals is changing, to the detriment of the private sector businesses. There have been big management changes at Serco and G4S, and their share prices have both fallen by around a sixth since May. So probably the most interesting conclusion by the NAO is the one that goes against the grain of typical political and public discourse about private sector providers. The NAO warns the Cabinet Office that there is a limit to the financial squeeze it can put on the likes of the big four, and that it may not be too long before there will be a loss of \"innovation and investment\" which \"could pose a risk to value for money in the longer term.\" The watchdog takes seriously the private sector providers when they say they may choose not to bid for future contracts in certain public services. And that could be a problem, because - with so much outsourced since the 1980s - it is not obvious that the public sector retains the competence and skills to take back some of these services. Or to return to where I started, given that public and private sectors are now so intimately and intricately combined, it may not be unreasonable for the taxpayer as employer to have much clearer sight of how much profit the contractor is earning.",

        "Fifteen years on, she still is the only black woman to have won the award - and she's not happy about it. Speaking in Cannes last week, the actress said she had been \"profoundly hurt\" when no black stars were nominated for major acting awards at the 2015 Oscars. Her comments have been followed by the Academy announcing it is inviting 774 new members from 57 countries in an effort to boost diversity. Actors Naomie Harris, Riz Ahmed and Warwick Davis are among those invited to join, with the Oscars organisers saying 39 of the new class are women, boosting the overall female membership to 28, up three points from 2015. It added that the new membership is also nearly a third non-white, with the number of non-white voters now at 13, up from 8 two years ago. But Berry said of her Oscar win: \"It was probably one of my lowest professional moments.\" The 50-year-old told Teen Vogue's Elaine Welteroth said she had thought back to the night she won her Academy Award and thought: \"Wow, that moment really meant nothing.\" \"I was profoundly hurt by that and saddened by that and it inspired me to try to get involved in other ways,\" she continued. \"Which is why I want to start directing, I want to start producing more [and] I want to start being a part of making more opportunities for people of colour.\" On the night in question, Berry dedicated her win to \"every nameless, faceless woman of colour who now has a chance because this door has been opened.\" Since her victory, though, only four black actresses have been nominated for the best actress Oscar. They include Viola Davis - winner of this year's best supporting actress Oscar - and Ruth Negga, who was nominated this year for Loving. Precious star Gabourey Sidibe and Quvenzhane Wallis, the young lead in Beasts of the Southern Wild, were also shortlisted for the best actress award in 2010 and 2013 respectively. Four nominations in 15 years is hardly something to write home about. Yet it's worth remembering that in the 72 years of Oscar ceremonies before Berry's win, only six black actresses had ever been up for her award. Two of those nominations came in 1973, when Diana Ross and Cicely Tyson - nominated respectively for Lady Sings the Blues and Sounder - lost out to Cabaret's Liza Minnelli. Before that the only black actress to come within touching distance of the statuette was Dorothy Dandridge, who was nominated in 1955 in Carmen Jones. Four black men have won the best actor Oscar since the first ceremony was held in 1929, while nine more have been nominated. The issue of black representation at the Academy Awards became a matter of public concern in 2015 and 2016, years in which no person of colour was nominated for any of the acting prizes. This led to the \"OscarsSoWhite\" campaign and moves by the Academy to make both its membership and nominations more diverse. So is Berry right to feel aggrieved? We put that question to Sarita Malik, a professor of media, culture and communications at London's Brunel University who specialises in diversity and screen media. \"What Halle Berry says reveals the burden of representation that has historically been placed on black actors, films and representations more widely - the idea these have to deal with the persistent problem of under-representation,\" she told the BBC. \"Her disappointment has come to characterise our expectations, where we are led to believe that more and better kinds of diverse representation will follow these rare successes. \"The Oscars is a big deal because of its international profile, its legacy and as a barometer of the cultural mood,\" she continued. \"If the Oscars is virtually all-white, as historically it has tended to be, this says something about the kinds of culture we celebrate and support. But it also reveals the kinds of films that are commissioned, funded and made visible through marketing and distribution. \"The past couple of years have usefully brought to the fore important public debates about diversity in the film industry and it is a positive step that the Academy's membership is being broadened. \"It's important that there is more diversity in leadership but also that, rather than churning out more and more diversity initiatives, the question of why such inequality exists is tackled head-on.\" Gaylene Gould, writer and head of cinemas and events at BFI Southbank, believes Berry is right to speak out. \"She's the only black actress to ever receive a best actress award in the whole history of Oscars so of course she's justified,\" she told the BBC. \"I can totally see why she's depressed.\" Gould also believes it's significant that while Berry remains the sole best actress winner, seven black actresses have been named best supporting actress. \"If a black woman is going to get something it will be best supporting actress,\" she said. \"It rarely goes higher than that.\" Hattie McDaniel was the first black actress to be named best supporting actress, winning for Gone with the Wind in 1940. The next was Whoopi Goldberg, who won the award for Ghost more than half a century later. \"There is a question there about where we position women, where we position black women and how seriously they're taken in cinema,\" Gould continued. \"A lot of what we do at the British Film Institute is all about how you create opportunities and systemically change the fundamental trends within the sector.\" Last year the BFI launched its Black Star season, a three-month, UK-wide celebration of black screen talent.

        "Campaigners fought to save Ipswich Airport after it was earmarked for housing by Ipswich Borough Council, with some occupying the terminal building for about four months. The anniversary of the closure is being marked with an exhibition. Organisers said: \"There is now a generation that probably doesn't even know Ipswich had its own airport.\" The site was formerly a World War Two airfield and home to RAF Blenheim light bombers, Hurricanes and - for short periods - Spitfire squadrons. During its 66-year history, the airport launched a daily flight to Clacton with a journey time of just 15 minutes in 1938 and it later handled flights carrying royal passengers and sports stars. In the 1980s, Suckling Airways started operating flights to Amsterdam and Manchester and by 1990 the airport housed flying schools, a helicopter school, parachute centre and various support firms. But in 1996 the borough council, which owned the airport, announced the site would close later that year, to be turned into what is now the Ravenswood housing estate. Saturday's exhibition at the town's Transport Museum has been put together by Ipswich Airport Association (IAA) whose members will be on hand to answer questions. The reunion and exhibition will also feature press cuttings, photos and memorabilia to mark 20 years since the airport officially closed on 31 December 1996. Martyn Steggalls, a director of the IAA, who worked part-time at the airport, said: \"It's a time when a lot of people involved in the airport can get together and reminisce. \"It's a focal point to people who used to fly from there, work there and lived nearby.\"",
        "Cameron Stewart missed a great first-half chance for Linfield but they had to battle hard to repel pressure from the home side in the second period. Aaron Burns also wasted a second-half chance but the visitors had some nervous moments before progressing. Linfield will host Celtic in their first leg on Friday 14 July. It is estimated that the second qualifying round tie against the Scottish champions could earn the Irish Premiership winners up to PS1million in Uefa prize money, gate receipts, television revenue, advertising and merchandising. Security concerns around the tie led to agreement that any potential first leg between the clubs at Windsor Park would be moved from the normal midweek slot to the Friday because of the clash with the 12th of July marches in Northern Ireland. Celtic also announced they would not take supporters to Belfast because of safety worries. Linfield had the better of the possession in the first half with Andrew Waterworth having an early chance stopped by La Fiorita keeper Gianluca Vivan before Stewart headed his great opportunity over the crossbar on 37 minutes after a superb Jamie Mulgrew cross. However, the home produced intense pressure immediately after the restart and, for the most part, Linfield retreated into their own half during the remainder of the contest as they held on to the first-leg lead secured by Jordan Stewart's late goal. A dreadful clearance by keeper Vivan gifted a lobbed chance to substitute Burns in the 70th minute but he pulled his shot badly wide. La Fiorita, aiming for a first win in a European tie at the sixth attempt, produced intense late pressure but their only clear opening came two minutes from time when substitute Adrian Ricchiuti had an effort blocked. The San Marino champions continued to press during the four minutes of injury-time, although Mulgrew did produce a late break into the La Fiorita penalty area before being handed a yellow card after being adjudged to have dived in the box. Linfield manager David Healy told the club's website: \"I'm delighted. Our main objective was to get through into the second round. We've done that and we've earned the right to play a fantastic club in Celtic. \"The players worked their socks off. Was it pretty? No it wasn't, but it was effective. The players were organised and they gave everything in their bodies tonight.\" Match ends, La Fiorita 0, Linfield 0. Second Half ends, La Fiorita 0, Linfield 0.

        "The 17-time Grand Slam champion beat France's Gasquet 6-4 6-2 6-2 to give the Swiss an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"This one is for the boys,\" said Federer, who was in tears at the end of the match. \"This is not for me, I have won enough. I am just happy we can give everyone in our country a historic moment.\" Federer, 33, also paid tribute to compatriot Stan Wawrinka, who helped set up the victory in Lille by beating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga before partnering Federer to win the doubles. Federer and Wawrinka were involved in a row at the ATP Tour Finals in London, which the world number two later described as \"heat of the moment.\" \"Stan has put in so much effort over the years. He played an unbelievable weekend and that is what gave me the opportunity today,\" said Federer. Federer, who lost his singles rubber to Gael Monfils on Friday, played an inspired match as he crushed Gasquet, who replaced Tsonga due to an arm injury. In front of a passionate crowd of 27,448 - a world record for a competitive tennis match - Federer dropped only four points on his imperious serve in the opening set, which he sealed with a whipping forehand winner. World number 26 Gasquet dropped serve in the first and seventh games of the second set, which Federer took without conceding a single break point. He broke the Frenchman twice in the final set to serve for the match and claimed victory with a deft backhand drop shot - collapsing in tears onto the clay at the Stade Pierre-Mauroyto. The Swiss win comes a week after Federer pulled out of the Tour Finals title match against Novak Djokovic at the O2 in London to protect a back injury.",
        "The PS127m, four-year arts programme began in 2008 and climaxed with the London 2012 Festival last summer. The festival included a nationwide bell-ringing event, a bouncy Stonehenge and a string quartet in helicopters. By September 2012, the report said, 29 of the UK population was aware of the Olympiad and the festival. This figure rose to over 40 in London, it continued, adding the four years were believed to have seen 37.4 million attendances. The Liverpool University study, published on Thursday, also said the Olympiad helped enhance the perception of Britain abroad. But one arts expert has questioned how effectively the message about the London 2012 Festival came across. \"The numbers do not lie,\" said Marc Sands, the Tate's director of audiences and media. \"Vast swathes of the UK population and tourists visiting the UK for that incredible summer in some way experienced the London 2012 Festival. \"However, much as they may have enjoyed the event they were attending, my lasting impression is that they were unaware they were participating in a festival. \"Six months on from the end of London 2012, many people look at you blankly when you ask them about the London 2012 Festival,\" he went on. \"They remember the Olympics clearly, but are a little fuzzier about the cultural festival. \"When you ask about the cultural events that comprised the festival, they remember them well and with much affection. \"Therein lay the marketing dilemma, a gap for the festival's communications and a challenge that marketing should have solved.\" Sands was commissioned by the London 2012 Festival organisers to give his personal reflection on the 12-week event. His essay was published on Thursday alongside the official evaluation of the Cultural Olympiad, by the University of Liverpool's Institute of Cultural Capital. The report said the size of the Olympiad audience - including participants and volunteers - was estimated at 43.4 million, with an additional 204.4 million reached through broadcasts and online viewings. It said the millions of free tickets - the festival claimed 15.4 million \"free audiences or participants\" - enabled new audiences, especially young people, to attend festival events. Research showed that 19 of the population and 84 of London 2012 Festival attendees believed the festival made a \"positive contribution\" to the games. In his introduction to the report, Tony Hall, chair of the Cultural Olympiad Board, said festival organisers had hoped the cultural programme would be \"a game changer.\" The intention, he wrote in his introduction to the report, had been \"putting art at the heart of the Games themselves, showcasing UK world-class excellence with high economic stakes to play for cultural tourism and creative industries.\" \"Communities all over the UK participated with enthusiasm, and the majority have been inspired to carry on enjoying culture and creativity,\" he continued. Formerly chief executive of the Royal Opera House and now director general of the BBC, Lord Hall took over the running of the Cultural Olympiad in 2009. Highlights of the London 2012 Festival programme included the World Shakespeare Festival, Mark Rylance's sonnets on the London Underground, and Deborah Warner's Peace Camp project, which featured encampments of glowing tents in remote coastal locations. The Cultural Olympiad also included Unlimited - the largest ever commission of art by disabled and deaf artists - during the Paralympic Games. Culture Secretary Maria Miller described the events of the previous year as an \"enormous success.\" Speaking at the launch of the report at London's Barbican, she said: \"The Cultural Olympiad inspired an entire generation to really think again about how they participate in cultural events and activities.\" Cultural Olympiad director Ruth Mackenzie said she had been to Rio - where the next Olympics will take place in 2016 - to discuss with arts organisations \"how to put culture at the heart of the games.\"",
        "Schooling, 21, won in an Olympic record time of 50.39 seconds. The Singaporean was always in control and won by 0.75 seconds from the trio of Phelps, South Africa's Chad le Clos and Hungary's Laszlo Cseh. Phelps, 31, could win his 23rd gold in the 4x100m medley relay on Saturday. The American was not part of his country's team that qualified for the final having taken the afternoon off after winning his 22nd gold in the 200m individual medley on Thursday. Phelps, who was denied a fourth successive gold in the 100m butterfly by Schooling, will end his Olympic career by competing in the final race in the Rio pool. \"This is it. I'm not doing it. I swore in London I wasn't coming back but this is final,\" he said. Schooling said of his win: \"I'm just ecstatic. I don't think it has set in yet. It's just crazy. \"I hope that Michael can stay around long enough for me to race him again. I'd love that.\"",
        "The west African nation branded the 54-member grouping, which includes the UK and most of its former colonies, a \"neo-colonial institution.\" The withdrawal was announced on state TV but no other reasons were given. Two years ago President Yahya Jammeh accused the UK of backing his political opposition ahead of elections. Commonwealth officials said they only heard about the move through the media and had not yet been contacted by The Gambia. A spokesman said Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma had seen the reports with \"dismay and disappointment\" and had asked for \"clarification\" from the country. There is a history of tension between President Jammeh, who came to power in a 1994 coup, and the UK. Earlier this year, a Foreign Office report singled out The Gambia for its human rights record, citing cases of unlawful detentions, illegal closures of newspapers and discrimination against minority groups. On Thursday a Foreign Office spokesman said: \"Decisions on Commonwealth membership are a matter for each member government. We would very much regret Gambia, or any other country, deciding to leave the Commonwealth.\" In August last year The Gambia was criticised by Amnesty International and others for executing nine prisoners by firing squad. The Commonwealth was founded in 1931 but acquired its modern shape after 1949 as former British colonies and protectorates, including The Gambia, started to achieve self-government and varying degrees of independence. According to the Commonwealth's charter, member states should communicate and co-operate \"in the common interests of our peoples and in the promotion of international understanding and world peace.\" In its statement, The Gambian government said it had \"withdrawn its membership of the British Commonwealth.\" It said it had \"decided that The Gambia will never be a member of any neo-colonial institution and will never be a party to any institution that represents an extension of colonialism.\" But Bakary Dabo, former vice president of The Gambia and chairman of the country's campaign for democratic change, said people there are generally \"very happy\" to be part of the Commonwealth. He said the government had recently begun \"picking up war against poorly specified enemies called'western powers'.\" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Dabo said this rhetoric had \"accelerated\" in recent years and been used when President Jammeh gave a \"rambling\" speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month Also at the UN, President Jammeh said homosexuality was one of the three \"biggest threats to human existence.\" He has also drawn international criticism for claiming he can cure Aids with a herbal body rub and bananas. BBC Africa analyst Farouk Chothia said despite its image as an idyllic holiday destination, The Gambia, and its population of less than two million, were kept under tight control by its eccentric leader. The latest decision was bound to come from him, our analyst added. The Royal Commonwealth Society, an education charity which works in Commonwealth countries, said The Gambia's announcement was unexpected and appeared to be undemocratic. Society director Michael Lake said President Jammeh had made the decision \"without consulting The Gambia's people\" and the country's withdrawal would be \"a loss felt by both its people and the wider Commonwealth network.\" He added: \"Far from being a'neo-colonial institution', the modern Commonwealth operates on a consensus model and its voluntary membership is predicated primarily on a country's commitment to upholding shared values and principles.\" The last time a nation left the Commonwealth was in 2003, when Zimbabwe withdrew. The Queen, who is 87, is the head of the Commonwealth, which holds its next heads of government meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka, next month. However, the gathering will be the first that the Queen has not attended since 1971. She will send her son, the Prince of Wales instead. Buckingham Palace said she would make fewer overseas trips because of her age. Three African countries have joined the Commonwealth in recent years. Rwanda was admitted in 2009 after applying for membership the previous year, while Cameroon and Mozambique became members in 1995.",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device No official announcement has yet been made by either club. As part of the deal to sell 24-year-old De Gea to Real, United were planning to bring Costa Rica keeper Keylor Navas, 28, in the opposite direction. There is no precedent for Spanish clubs being given additional time to conclude transfers as there is in England. Blame for the failure to complete the deal is already being apportioned. Reports in Spain claim United were responsible for the deal collapsing. The line is they did not get their paperwork to Spanish Football Federation headquarters until a minute after the 23:00 BST deadline. United say they have a receipt that proves they submitted the relevant documents in time. It remains to be seen whether Real will appeal to world governing body Fifa, which is responsible for sanctioning international transfers. The internet naturally had its say... And the tweets only intensified once stories of a technical glitch at the Madrid end began to surface... If Real Madrid don't appeal, or do appeal and fail to push the transfer through, he'll be back at Old Trafford competing for a place in the United starting line-up. Sergio Romero, the Argentina number one, has started all six of United's games so far this season, with Sam Johnstone on the substitutes' bench. The Red Devils still have Victor Valdes after his move to Besiktas collapsed, but he has fallen out with manager Louis van Gaal. De Gea, who has not played for United this season, must first turn his attention to international duty with Spain. They have two Euro 2016 qualifying matches to negotiate, at home to Slovakia on 5 September and in Macedonia on 8 September. They seem pretty relaxed about it all. If De Gea stays, they have a world-class keeper to call on. If he goes, the Navas deal could still happen. Unlike Real, United have a few more hours to do their business. The transfer window may be shut in Spain, but it remains open until 18:00 BST on Tuesday for Premier League clubs. Monday was mostly about letting players leave... But the move that caught a lot of people by surprise involved a French teenager named Anthony Martial. It appears United are willing to pay as much as PS36m to get him. A 19-year-old Monaco striker with plenty of potential. He has even been likened to Thierry Henry. Nevertheless, PS36m is a lot to pay for a teenager. According to French football journalist Philippe Auclair, the size of the transfer fee has left \"people speechless in France.\" \"He's got good technique, good skills, he's a good finisher, but he is still a raw product,\" added Auclair. \"We don't know how far he can go.\"",
        "Officials in Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia all said they had not formally agreed to join the alliance. Saudi Arabia on Tuesday said 34 mainly Muslim nations would be part of the counter-terrorism grouping. Prince Mohammed said it would focus on efforts to fight terrorism in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan. \"Currently, every Muslim country is fighting terrorism individually.... so co-ordinating efforts is very important,\" he told a news conference. He indicated there were still \"procedures\" for these countries to go through before joining, \"but out of keenness to achieve this coalition as soon as possible, [the alliance of] 34 countries has been announced.\" Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Aizaz Chaudhry was quoted in the Dawn newspaper as saying he was surprised by the announcement and had asked the Pakistani ambassador in Riyadh for clarification. The country's foreign office said in a statement later on Wednesday that it was \"awaiting further details to decide the extent of its participation in different activities of the alliance\" before making a decision on whether to join. In Indonesia, the foreign ministry said it too had not yet decided whether to join. \"The government is still observing and waiting to see the modalities of the military coalition formed by Saudi Arabia,\" foreign ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir told The Jakarta Post. Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein went further - expressing support for the coalition but ruling out any military involvement from Kuala Lumpur. \"The Saudi initiative does not involve any military commitment, but an understanding that we will combat militancy,\" he said. Announcing the alliance, Saudi Arabia said a joint operations centre would be established in the capital Riyadh and the coalition would focus on terror groups \"whatever their doctrine.\" It comes amid international pressure for Gulf Arab states to do more in the fight against so-called Islamic State. The BBC's Frank Gardner points out that the Shia-majority nations of Iran and Iraq, as well as Syria, are noticeably absent from the alliance. It is far from clear how it could conduct counter-terrorism operations in IS-plagued Iraq and Syria without the agreement of those governments, he adds.

        "Liz Saville Roberts' private members' bill is aimed at giving victims more confidence in coming forward to report rape. It comes after the Ched Evans retrial jury was allowed to hear details about the sexual history of the complainant. Chesterfield striker Mr Evans was cleared of rape last October. Following the case Attorney General Jeremy Wright told the Commons that giving a court details of a complainant's sexual history was not \"routinely used\" in such cases, but there was \"a concern.\" A review into the laws protecting alleged rape victims was also launched. Ms Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, will introduce the bill on Wednesday. It has cross-party support. It replicates the so-called'Rape Shield Law' which exists in the USA, Canada and Australia and aims to prevent the cross-examination of a rape complainant's sexual history, previous behaviour or appearance. \"It is neither right nor just that a victim of rape can be questioned in court on matters not relevant to the case in hand,\" said Ms Saville Roberts. \"Yet in the recent past victims have been humiliated by lawyers asking questions about their sexual partners, their clothing and appearance. \"Such practices will undoubtedly make victims reluctant to come forward and more likely to drop complaints and there is already anecdotal evidence that high profile cases involving such evidence being used has led to a drop in the number of women who are coming forward.\" An 18-month study undertaken by Dame Vera Baird QC in 2015 concluded that in over a third of all rape cases heard at Newcastle Crown Court, there were questions about prior sexual conduct of the complainant. The charity Voice4Victim, which worked closely with Ms Saville Roberts on the bill, said changes to legislation were urgently needed. Its founder Claire Waxman said: \"This brutal cross-examination of rape victims re-traumatises the victim and causes them irreparable harm. \"It's this victim-blaming attitude of rape victims that needs to be stamped out from the justice process to ensure victims have the faith and confidence to come forward and report these serious crimes.\" In 2012, Mr Evans, 28, was found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, the previous year. He served half of a five-year prison term. But that conviction was quashed on appeal last April and he was found not guilty of the same charge at the subsequent retrial.",

        "Murray, the first British man to reach a Roland Garros final since 1937, hopes to add the French Open to his victories at the US Open and Wimbledon. Djokovic, the world number one, can finally add the one major title to have so far eluded him. It will be the pair's seventh meeting in a Grand Slam final. Djokovic leads that head-to-head 4-2, their overall contests 23-10 and has 11 major titles to Murray's two - but it was the Serb whom Murray beat to claim his Grand Slam victories at the US Open in 2012 and Wimbledon in 2013. The Scot also won their most recent meeting in the final of the clay-court Italian Open four weeks ago. Listen - Can Murray fight French Open demons? There is a huge amount at stake for both men in Sunday's final, with Murray again looking to match Fred Perry, Britain's last male champion in 1935. Sue Barker won the women's title in 1976 but since then a surprise run to the semi-finals by Tim Henman in 2004, followed by three semi-finals for Murray, were the best any Briton had managed on the Paris clay. \"It's obviously a very big match for both of us, Novak trying to win the career slam and me trying to win my first French Open,\" Murray said. \"Neither of us know how many more chances we'll have to win here. It's a very tough event to win. \"There's a lot riding on the match for both of us.\" It is the first final between two top seeds trying to win a Grand Slam title for the first time since Ivan Lendl beat John McEnroe in Paris 32 years ago. Murray will hope to emulate the achievement of his former coach - and then second seed - Lendl, and he takes on a very familiar rival. Both finalists turned 29 last month and have known each other since junior days - but Djokovic has taken a firm grip on their personal duel in recent years, winning 12 of their last 14 matches. \"We have had some really big battles in the Slams before on all the other surfaces,\" Murray said. \"I'm sure it will be the same again on Sunday.\" Murray needed five sets to beat Radek Stepanek and Mathias Bourgue in his first two matches, and four sets to beat Richard Gasquet in the quarter-finals, but played superbly to beat defending champion Stan Wawrinka on Friday. \"The conditions aren't that easy,\" he said. \"It's been cold, wet, slow - much, much slower than what we played in the last few weeks. \"Obviously getting through difficult matches, you can find your rhythm. I spent a lot of time on court at the beginning of the event. I'm starting to feel better every day.\" Djokovic and Murray have stood at the top of the rankings for all but a week in 2016 - but the Serb has a huge lead and would hold all four Grand Slam titles with another victory over Murray. Only American Don Budge in the 1930s and Australia's Rod Laver in the 1960s have achieved that feat, and just seven men have completed the career slam. However, Djokovic has played three French Open finals without success, losing twice to Rafael Nadal and then suffering a surprise defeat by an inspired Wawrinka 12 months ago. \"I've put myself in a position in which I wanted to be in of course ever since last year's final,\" Djokovic said. \"It's always high on the priority list when I start a season, thinking about Roland Garros.\" Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",
        "\"I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen and I will now form a majority Conservative government. \"I have been proud to lead the first coalition government in 70 years and I want to thank all those who worked so hard to make it a success, and in particular, on this day, Nick Clegg. \"Elections can be bruising clashes of ideas and arguments and a lot of people who believe profoundly in public service have seen that service cut short. \"Ed Miliband rang me this morning to wish me luck with the new government. It was a typically generous gesture from someone who is clearly in public service for all the right reasons. \"The government I led did important work. It laid the foundations for a better future and now we must build on them. \"I truly believe we are on the brink of something special in our country. We can make Britain a place where a good life is in reach for everyone who is willing to work and do the right thing. \"Our manifesto is a manifesto for working people and as a majority government we will be able to deliver all of it. Indeed it is the reason why I think majority government is more accountable. \"Three million apprenticeships, more help with childcare, helping 30m people cope with the cost of living by cutting their taxes. Building homes that people are able to buy and own. \"Creating millions more jobs that give people the chance of a better future. And yes, we will deliver that in-out referendum on our future in Europe. \"As we conduct this vital work we must ensure that we bring our country together. As I said in the small hours of this morning, we will govern as a party of one nation, one United Kingdom. That means ensuring this recovery reaches all parts of our country, from north to south, from east to west. \"And indeed it means rebalancing our economy - building that northern powerhouse. It means giving everyone in our country a chance - so no matter where you're from, you have the opportunity to make the most of your life. \"It means giving the poorest people the chance of training, a job, and hope for the future. It means that for children who don't get the best start in life, there must be the nursery education and good schooling that can transform their life chances. \"And of course it means bringing together the different nations of our United Kingdom. I have always believed in governing with respect. That's why in the last parliament we devolved power to Scotland and Wales - and gave the people of Scotland a referendum on whether to stay inside the UK. \"In this parliament, I will stay true to my word and implement as fast as I can the devolution that all parties agreed for Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Governing with respect means recognising that the different nations of our United Kingdom have their own governments, as well as the UK government. \"Both are important and indeed with our plans the governments of these nations will become more powerful with wider responsibilities. In Scotland, our plans are to create the strongest devolved government anywhere in the world, with important powers over taxation. And no constitutional settlement will be complete if it did not offer also fairness to England. \"When I stood here five years ago, our country was in the grip of an economic crisis. Five years on, Britain is so much stronger. But the real opportunities lie ahead. \"Everything I have seen over the last five years, and indeed during this election campaign, has proved once again that this is a country with unrivalled skills and creativeness, a country with such good humour and such great compassion. \"And I am convinced that if we draw on all of this, then we can take these islands, with our proud history, and build an even prouder future. \"Together, we can make Great Britain greater still.\"",

        "It should \"stand up to government and say we need legal change.... to strengthen governance,\" he said. He added that shareholders also had to take responsibility and act if a company's standards were failing. The FRC said it had requested more powers to tackle bad behaviour. From the end of MG Rover, to the near-collapse of Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, through to Tesco's accounting scandal and BHS's extinction, failings in corporate leadership have continued to stalk UK businesses. It is 25 years since the Cadbury code was published, which put in place most of the rules governing public company practices and is overseen by the FRC. Sir Adrian Cadbury wrote his report in 1992 following scandals such as the collapse of the bank BCCI and textile company Polly Peck, along with Robert Maxwell's raid on Mirror Group pensioners. It has been the cornerstone of corporate governance ever since. It recommended an independent board, reasonable pay to attract executives and formal processes to appoint directors. \"The Financial Reporting Council which controls the Cadbury code, and is a rather timid body, should get stronger,\" Lord Myners told the BBC's Today programme. It should \"stand up to government and say we need legal change in a number of areas to strengthen governance.\" The code has no punitive means of enforcement and follows a so-called comply or explain model. If a company wishes to shun a particular rule, it can give its reasons for doing so. This arrangement aims to stop companies ducking rules as a matter course and rewards openness. But critics say it treats all rules as optional. \"It hasn't been binding enough,\" Lord Myners said. In a statement to the BBC, the FRC said: \"The FRC has called on the government for more powers to tackle all directors when companies fail, not just those we regulate (accountants and actuaries), and we want more scrutiny on directors fulfilling their obligations under the Companies Act. \"The Corporate Governance Code's'comply or explain' approach has allowed the FRC to respond confidently and effectively to evolving market circumstances, which prescriptive hard rules often cannot.\" Its latest monitoring report on the code shows \"high compliance\" among companies, but when boards don't follow the rules \"too many explanations are of poor quality.\" \"This suggests that some boards still need to do more than pay lip service to the needs of their shareholders and other stakeholders. \"The FRC believes more focused reporting by boards on how they discharge their responsibilities is necessary and has called for more oversight powers from government to help achieve this.\" Another criticism from Lord Myners is the role of shareholders themselves in controlling corporations. \"Cadbury did not focus at all on the roles and the duties and obligation of the shareholders and that's where the failing is happening,\" he said. \"Nobody owns enough of a company to really be put out enough to really dig in and find out what's wrong.\" He termed this the problem of \"ownerless corporations.\" This view echoed that of Chris Philp, MP for Croydon South, who told the Today programme in September that UK companies should adopt a Swedish-style shareholder committee in an effort to curb excessive pay for bosses. The five biggest shareholders in large publicly-traded companies would sit on the committee, Mr Philp suggested, and this would make decisions on pay and hiring directors.

        "In January, the loyalist campaign of protest against Belfast City Council's vote to limit the flying of the union flag to designated days only was still at its height. By December, attempts by dissident republicans to disrupt pre-Christmas trade captured the headlines. In one shocking incident, a man set himself alight, apparently when a firebomb he intended to plant detonated prematurely. However, those seeking to cause disruption did not have matters all their own way. Fermanagh played host to what was commonly acknowledged to have been the most peaceful gathering of G8 leaders in recent years - an event quite unthinkable during the Troubles. In Belfast's Waterfront Hall, the US president. Barack Obama, told 2,000 school pupils that the terms of peace might be negotiated by political leaders, but the fate of the peace process was up to everyone, young and old. Meanwhile, Londonderry spent the year basking in its status as UK City of Culture. Early fears that Irish republican qualms about the city of culture's \"UK\" label would overshadow the year receded once the extraordinary procession of events, such as a musical hot air balloon overflight, a lumiere lighting up the city, and the massive fleadh cheoil Irish folk festival got under way. With no general elections to fight, 2013 might have been a year during which relationships between the main Stormont parties eased, enabling the power-sharing executive to make progress on a number of fronts. In reality, the tensions raised by the Belfast union flag dispute prevented any mid-term detente, making it impossible to bridge policy gaps on outstanding issues like welfare reform. Under pressure from the Northern Ireland Office and Downing Street, the first and deputy first ministers did make an ambitious sounding declaration - setting 2023 as their target date for bringing down Belfast's peace walls. Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness also announced plans for new shared education campuses, and schemes intended to bring young Protestants and Catholics together in work placements or summer camps. The payback from London came with confirmation that the G8 summit would take place in Northern Ireland and a package of financial assistance to the executive as they sought to provide prosperity and stability. However, the big prize Stormont politicians still pursue, the devolution of corporation tax, was not forthcoming as the Treasury chose to delay any decision until after the Scottish independence referendum. Even as they announced their 10-year target for bringing down the peace walls, the first and deputy first ministers acknowledged they had not been able to resolve the \"tough issues\": flags, parades and the past. They needed help from a neutral arbiter, so approached the respected former US envoy, Dr Richard Haass. Before Dr Haass had a chance to start work, relations between Northern Ireland's leaders hit a new low. During the summer, there were renewed tensions over Orange Order and other parades in Belfast, and a Sinn Fein commemoration for dead republicans in Castlederg, County Tyrone. In a letter from his holiday home in Florida, Mr Robinson put on hold the executive's prestige Maze Peace Centre project. The decision infuriated Mr McGuinness and made for an awkward week in New York as the two politicians lobbied together for fresh investment, trying their best to hide their obvious disagreements. For the Ulster Unionists, the DUP decision to halt the Maze centre was a cause for celebration. They had campaigned against the centre as a potential \"shrine\" to the IRA, and their leader, Mike Nesbitt, began his annual conference speech with a picture of the Maze behind his podium, just to drive home his tactical victory. The hard line taken by the Ulster Unionists on the Maze followed the loss of two of their most liberal assembly members. Basil McCrea and John McCallister opposed their party's decision to support a unionist unity candidate in a Westminster by-election in Mid Ulster in March. Sinn Fein's Francie Molloy won the election, replacing Mr McGuinness as an abstentionist MP. The articulate duo of McCrea and McCallister formed a new liberal unionist party, called NI21. NI21 are new arrivals - the Traditional Unionists have been around a bit longer. 2013 was a good year for the TUV leader Jim Allister, who succeeded in getting his Special Advisers Bill passed. Prompted by the outcry over the appointment of a Sinn Fein adviser convicted for her part in the murder of magistrate's daughter Mary Travers, the bill prevented anyone with such a serious conviction getting a similar job. Mr Allister also impressed in his cross-examination of the DUP Social Development Minister Nelson McCausland who faced questions about his handling of some Housing Executive contracts. Both the SDLP and the DUP promoted some younger faces during 2013. The DUP replaced its East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson with its Strangford MLA Simon Hamilton at the finance department. Whether Mr Wilson decides to give up his Westminster seat or his Stormont post in 2015 will be an interesting pointer not just to the future of the DUP but also where senior politicians believe the centre of gravity now lies. The SDLP replaced their environment minister Alex Attwood with one of their Foyle MLAs, Mark Durkan, nephew of the party's MP of the same name. The young minister proved his mettle when he withdrew a major planning bill rather than allow the DUP and Sinn Fein to graft on major amendments that he opposed. However, the most unexpected development, so far as the SDLP was concerned, was not Mr Durkan's promotion, but the dramatic fall from public life of a man widely predicted to be a future party leader. When the BBC initially questioned Conall McDevitt about using his wife's firm for assembly research, the matter seemed a little local difficulty. But when it emerged that Mr McDevitt had also not disclosed some earnings from a public relations firm at the outset of his career in the assembly, the South Belfast MLA decided he had no option but to quit politics entirely. The economy and traditional greenorange concerns dominated Stormont proceedings. But the politics of health and morality also drew considerable attention. Health Minister Edwin Poots of the DUP faced criticism over plans to close care homes for the elderly. He also found himself centre stage after losing a court case challenging his policy preventing blood donations from gay men. Then there was his department's delay in issuing new abortion guidelines - and the legal confusion highlighted by cases of pregnant women having to travel to England for terminations even though they had been advised their baby had no chance of survival. The issue posed challenges not just for Mr Poots but also for the Alliance Justice Minister David Ford, who announced his desire to consult on changes to the abortion law. Another moral matter that involved both Mr Ford and the DUP was human trafficking and prostitution. DUP peer Lord Morrow is keen on introducing a Swedish-style ban on paying for sexual services, but Mr Ford remains unconvinced. The Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams might no longer sit in the assembly, but his name continued to feature strongly in Stormont exchanges. Many of these concentrated on the conviction of Mr Adams' brother Liam for the rape and abuse of his daughter Aine. Unionist MLAs accused Mr Adams of not doing enough to report his brother's abuse - a claim he strongly denied. Mr Adams also faced criticism of his alleged involvement in the IRA's abduction and murder of one of the Disappeared, Jean McConville, and his comments about the \"laissez faire\" attitude of two RUC officers whose deaths were investigated by the Smithwick tribunal. The publication of the Smithwick report and the broadcast of a powerful BBCRTE documentary on the families of the Disappeared served as a reminder of the darkest days of the Troubles. Those memories were also on display in their most raw sense as survivors and the relatives of victims marked the 10th anniversaries of the IRA's Shankill bomb and the UFF Greysteel shooting. When Dr Haass started his work in earnest in September, most commentators believed he and his co-chair Meghan O'Sullivan might make progress on two items on their agenda, flags and parades. However, dealing with the past seemed too traumatic and too complex. That impression was strengthened by the furore that followed a suggestion from the Attorney General, John Larkin, that Troubles prosecutions should be brought to an end. Yet as 2013 came to a close, a surprise appeared in store. Stormont politicians remained deadlocked over flag flying. But there seemed to be more agreement on replacing the much criticised Parades Commission and designing an entirely new architecture to deal with the past. The Haass blueprint brought together several different agencies tackling aspects of the past into a single'Historical Investigations Unit'. Alongside the unit an'Independent Commission for Information Retrieval' would have the power, when a victims' family gave the go ahead, to offer limited immunity to anyone who came forward with information that might answer the family's questions. However, despite many gruelling hours of negotiations the US talks team were not able to broker a compromise. Both Sinn Fein and the SDLP indicated they would back the Haass proposals but unionists remained concerned about a new code of conduct on parades and the proposed examination of broad themes related to the Troubles such as collusion. Dr Haass hoped his proposals would eventually gain acceptance, but he boarded his plane home to New York without the New Year's Eve peace deal he must have really wanted to achieve.",

        "Strikes planned for Christmas were suspended after the new offer was made but members rejected it by 7-1. The strike affects \"mixed fleet\" staff who joined after 2010 and account for 15 of the total cabin crew. BA said it planned to \"ensure that all our customers travel to their destinations.\" It said further details for customers would be published on Friday 6 January, once it had finalised contingency plans. \"We are extremely disappointed that Unite has once again chosen to target our customers,\" the company said. \"We are now focused on protecting our customers from this unnecessary and completely unjustified action.\" The dispute concerns about 4,000 staff who have joined the airline since 2010 on \"mixed fleet\" contracts, who do not feel they are paid enough. About 2,500 of them are Unite members. Earnings were advertised between PS21,000 and PS25,000 but, in reality, start at just over PS12,000 plus PS3 an hour flying pay, Unite said. The union said its members rejected the new offer by 7-1. \"British Airways is needlessly provoking strike action by refusing to extend the mandate of the strike ballot and allow meaningful talks to take place,\" Unite's national office Oliver Richardson said. \"Instead of listening to why its mixed fleet cabin crew rejected the offer negotiated at Acas, British Airways has sought instead to try and bully a workforce of young men and women who are trying to eke out a living on poverty pay.\" However, he added that the union was \"hopeful that a negotiated settlement which meets our members' aspirations can be achieved\" and urged BA to \"engage constructively.\"",
        "Wigan followed up Warrington's win over Brisbane to secure a first World Club Series victory for the northern hemisphere over Australia's NRL. Wane told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: \"One thing we're good at in this country is looking for negatives. \"Let's be positive. Let's give Super League a pat on the back.\" National Rugby League clubs had won all six matches since the expanded World Club Series came into effect in 2015. Wane, whose side became the first from England to be crowned world champions since Leeds in 2012, added: \"Tony Smith did a great job with Warrington and we won fair and square. \"It's a fantastic feeling and I'm so pleased. The staff work hard but the players do their business out on the park. \"We did too much defending. I'm trying to stay positive and not think about how we played. I'm just glad to get the win.\" Wigan had lost to Brisbane in each of the past two seasons and lost their last World Club Challenge fixture to Sydney Roosters in Australia in 2014. But a hat-trick of tries from Joe Burgess against NRL champions Cronulla helped to add the 2017 title to those won by the Cherry and Whites in 1987, 1991 and 1994. Warrington made their second appearance in the World Club Series, having lost to St George Illawarra in 2015, and ended an eight-match losing streak for Super League clubs against their NRL counterparts with their win over the Broncos on Saturday. \"We realise it's big,\" said Wolves coach Smith. \"We knew that we were responsible for some of the credibility over here. They've shown that this is a good part of the world to play rugby league and we can play some pretty decent stuff. \"We want Super League to get stronger, but we also want to develop this concept as well. It would be great to go over and play the Broncos at their place. \"We're grateful they've come over here and given us the opportunity, and given our supporters the chance to see an iconic club play rugby league, and at the same time promote our sport worldwide.\" Many observers had concerns about the long-term future of the World Club Series because of the NRL's dominance in its first two years, but the Rugby Football League say discussions are ongoing about the make-up of the 2018 competition. A change of location and a return to the previous format of one match between the two competitions' respective champions have been suggested as alternatives. RFL chief executive Nigel Wood said: \"These two games have shown that the annual series between NRL and Super League clubs can be competitive. \"We are already in detailed discussion with our colleagues from the NRL about the format and potential locations for the 2018 World Club Series, and these discussions will advance over the coming weeks as we review the 2017 series. \"What is clear is that competitive international club rugby can showcase the very best in our sport to the world.\"",
        "His career high came in the 1970s and included the anthemic Baker Street and Stuck in the Middle with You, recorded with his band Stealers Wheel. Rafferty had battled a drink problem and spent time in hospital in Bournemouth with liver failure. He was born in Paisley and began his musical career as a busker on the London Underground. Rafferty died peacefully at his home in Dorset, with his daughter Martha at his bedside. It is understood his funeral will be held in Paisley later this month. Rafferty had recorded and toured with Billy Connolly as part of the Humblebums, before forming Stealers Wheel with his friend Joe Egan in 1972. Stuck in the Middle with You was a hit in the early 70s and also appeared on the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's debut film Reservoir Dogs in 1992. Baker Street charted in the UK and US in 1978 after Rafferty began his solo career and still achieves airplay on radio stations around the world. Musican Raphael Ravenscroft, who played the song's famous saxophone melody, described Rafferty as \"a fantastic writer\" who \"wrote some of my favourite songs of all time.\" In a statement, Billy Connolly called Rafferty \"a hugely talented songwriter and singer who will be greatly missed.\" He added, \"I was privileged to have spent my formative years working with Gerry and there remained a strong bond of friendship between us that lasted until his untimely death. \"Gerry had extraordinary gifts and his premature passing deprives the world of a true genius.\" Music journalist and BBC Radio 2 presenter Paul Gambaccini said it was a cruel irony that Baker Street, about Rafferty's unhappiness with being a star, brought him more of the fame he hated. Gambaccini said: \"He just wasn't of the constitution to deal with the music business, or to respect it. \"And thus he found fame and artistic success incompatible, and he became a wanderer, a lonely man, allegedly a drinker. And now we have this unhappy end.\" Musician and BBC 6 Music presenter Tom Robinson said Rafferty would be greatly missed. \"I'm deeply saddened to hear that Gerry has lost the battle with his failing health,\" he said. \"His early work with Stealers Wheel was an inspiration to a whole generation of songwriters in the 70s, including me. \"Many of us had hoped his recent album Life Goes On in 2009 would lead to a full-time return to writing and performing for a lyrical and highly gifted artist.\" BBC News website readers from around the world have sent in their tributes: Don't Speak of My Heart was my favourite. His voice was like velvet. Calmed me down just listening to him. I cannot believe he has gone. Susan Miller, Kilmaurs, Ayrshire, Scotland Have followed his releases from Stealers Wheel to present. He wrote beautiful songs and he and Joe Egan, who sadly didn't get the same recognition, have left me some great musical memories. George Morris, Donaghadee, County Down, Northern Ireland As a muso myself, I loved the arrangement of the haunting Baker Street and often performed Stuck In The Middle With You with a band I was a part of in the 80s and 90s in England. Both songs are played frequently on New Zealand radio stations. Gerry will be sorely missed. Tony Last, Hastings, New Zealand My first LP was Can I Have my Money Back, which I still have. My favourite song is The Ark from City to City with Jerry Donahue on guitar. He wrote about life itself, things one can relate to. He brought musical quality into life at times when there was not much around. Keith Dhan-Weller, Nuertingen, Germany Baker Street is probably my favourite song. I'm a songwriter and I teach creative writing. Baker Street is about Gerry's own experience with the music industry but he wrote the lyric in the third person. This makes the story more interesting and sad. The song works on so many different levels. Musically and lyrically. Richard Abbott, Limavady, Northern Ireland I was a young radio producer with BBC Scotland in the late 1960s when a couple of lads came in to Queen Margaret Drive to take part in some programmes. They were the Humblebums, and they made brilliant music. Rehearsals attracted all sorts of excuses from staff to absent themselves from their desks to go and listen in the studio cubicle. Little did we know.... Alan Muirhead, Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria, England My eldest daughter was in school with his daughter Martha when Gerry lived in Kilmacolm. My husband and I were great fans of his music and songs and are sorry to hear of his death. Rita Walker, Greenock, Scotland Gerry Rafferty had depths beyond his two best-selling singles.

        "Media playback is not supported on this device At 44 years old, Owens was the oldest of the 12 referees chosen for the World Cup, but his age will not prevent him from taking part in Japan in 2019. Selection criteria is based on performances and fitness, and Owens feels he has plenty more years in him. \"My plans at the moment are quite clearly to go on until 2019,\" he said. \"We had a meeting with the assessors and I was asked what my plans were and I said'I'm enjoying my refereeing and as long as I keep reffing well and I'm fit enough I want to go on to 2019'. \"Their response was'great, we're glad to hear that, we'd like you to be there in 2019'.\" Saturday's World Cup final at Twickenham, which New Zealand won 34-17 against Australia, was the pinnacle of Owens' 68-Test career. He became the second Welshman to oversee the final following Derek Bevan, who was in charge in 1991 when Australia edged England, also at Twickenham. South African Andre Watson is the only referee to be in charge of two finals. He was 45 on his second appearance in the 2003 final, won by England against hosts Australia. World Rugby, the game's governing body, has welcomed Owens' decision to prolong his international career, adding he had shown exceptional fitness standards during the recent tournament. Owens admits the pressure, scrutiny and physical demands on referees are higher than ever, but he insists the passion for the job remains. \"I just thoroughly enjoy it and I'm going to keep on doing it as long as I can and as long as I'm good at it,\" he said. \"When the time is right and I know the body or the mind can't take it any more because of the travelling or the pressure, or when the legs can't get there to make those big decisions, then I'll know that and I will be calling it a day when that happens.\" Sections of the Australian media have criticised aspects of Owens' performance in the final, claiming he missed a forward pass in the passage of play that ended with Dan Carter kicking a penalty to stretch New Zealand's advantage to 9-3. Owens, though, says he has learned to deal with criticism, and feels his decisions on Saturday did not affect the eventual outcome. \"If you can't deal with criticism as a referee you just can't do this job,\" he said. \"There's something in you that helps you deal with that. \"It doesn't make it any nicer for me to hear criticism, especially if any criticism is personal. \"As long as you can look back on a game and say'I did my best, I gave it my all' that's what counts.\" Owens revealed he was hugged and thanked for a \"great game\" by Australia number eight David Pocock moments after the final whistle. \"For someone who's just missed out on winning the Webb Ellis Trophy to come up and do that to you says a lot about the integrity of the man himself and what a wonderful sport rugby is,\" added Owens. The Welsh village of Gowerton will be Owens' next destination for a Swalec League Division One West match with Crymych. Two weeks later, he will be in the south of France for Toulon's European Champions Cup tie with Bath. \"I could've had a weekend off this weekend - a couple of refs have taken a couple of weekends off,\" said Owens. \"But I'd rather be out there reffing, whether it's under-12s, a schools game, youth game, a Division One West game or a World Cup final.\"",
        "Sepsis can lead to shock and rapid organ failure following an infection. A snapshot of 290 hospital patients showing signs of sepsis found only 12 were initially screened and treated in line with best practice. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said more needed to be done and he was \"open minded\" about potential options. Last year, more than 7,500 people were admitted to hospitals with sepsis. It can be treated effectively with antibiotics - if spotted quickly enough. Research, due to be published later this week, was led by intensive care consultant Dr Tamas Szakmany. \"We have seen in our study this year there was big variation in how the clinical teams were responding to sepsis,\" said Dr Szakmany. \"There are important pockets of very good practice and we have seen there are hospitals, there are health boards, where the response is less good.\" The issue is the focus for BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme, following Welsh weatherman Derek Brockway as he explores how his own father Cliff died of sepsis last year. On 30 December 2014, 17-year-old Chloe Christopher collapsed and died after developing sepsis. Her mother Michelle told Derek Brockway about the heartbreaking last moments of her daughter's life. The Welsh health secretary told the forecaster: \"We have got a health improvement programme. \"We are the first country within the UK to have this early warning score system.... but it has always been about how consistently that has been adhered to. \"If we level out that variation, we will end up saving more lives. So I wouldn't pretend to you or anyone else that we are perfect where we are.\" Mr Gething said he is considering whether to make hospitals screen patients with symptoms in the same way. \"I am open minded to that, absolutely,\" he said. \"I am not going to run away from choices to be made about improving the service.\" Early indications from the second annual snapshot by Dr Szakmany's team, expected to be published next year, suggest there has been an improvement.",

        "US and European bond prices have sunk in expectation that he will enact inflationary policies that speed the pace of interest rate rises. On Monday, some bond yields - which rise as the price falls - hit their highest for more than six months. Bonds globally lost 1.29tn (PS1tn) last week, according to Bank of America. And there is no sign that the bond sell-off is easing, depressing the value of some pension investments and making it more expensive for countries and companies to borrow money. On Monday, the 30-year US Treasury jumped above 3 for the first time since January. In the UK, the 10-year gilt yields returned to levels not seen since June's Brexit referendum vote. And German 30-year bunds rose above 1 for the first time since early May. Italian bonds have been among the most affected. Rome's 10-year yields rose four basis points to 2.01 on Monday, their highest in 14 months. \"It is a continuation of this recent trend. There are still these expectations that inflation could go up if the US takes a more expansionary fiscal stance,\" said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz said. Jim Cielinski, head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle, said the sell-off trend was not surprising, but the \"ferocity of the reversal\" was. And in a research note for Societe Generale, analyst Daniel Fermon said that rising interest rates may not be a good thing. \"As central banks are now less active in the bond market and Trump expects to cut taxes and launch a 1tn infrastructure investment plan, increasing the deficit, we believe rising US long-term rates remain a major risk for financial markets,\" he said. Investors had piled into bonds, seeking a safe - but low - rate of return during what has been years of sluggish growth in the US, Europe and Japan. But since inflation and interest rates are seen as likely to rise, investors are seeking assets with a more attractive return. With a Trump administration promising economic stimulus through spending and tax cuts, investors are worried about putting money into low fixed-payment assets, such as bonds. That has fuelled share markets since last Wednesday's election result. Wall Street's Dow Jones index closed at another record high on Friday, in the wake of Mr Trump's unexpected victory. European markets have also risen, and at midday on Monday, the FTSE 100, Cac-40 and Dax were all slightly higher. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei index hitting a nine-month high, closing up 1.7. Bond yields are up in the eurozone's financially stressed countries, such as Italy, Spain and Portugal and the moves have been quite pronounced over the last few days. Rising government borrowing costs were one of the central features of the region's financial crisis. So are we are looking at a re-run? There are three important differences to keep in mind. Those borrowing costs are still well below crisis levels. At the time, a rule of thumb for whether a bailout was needed was ten-year government borrowing costs of more than 7. Italy has just gone over 2, Portugal is 3.5. And it's happening to them all. Even ultra-safe Germany has seen its government bond yields rise, although they are much lower than Italy's. And the impetus is coming from outside, from political events in the US. Still, it is clear that Europe still has its weaknesses, especially in some countries' banks - Italy and Germany's Deutsche Bank most notably. The dollar has also strengthened against major currencies. The pound fell 1.1 to 1.2464. Currencies in many emerging markets - from the Mexican peso and Malaysian ringgit, to Turkey's lira and South African rand - fell on fears that protectionism and higher US interest could suck investment from these markets. \"Clearly the market has settled on a'buy dollar' theme, on the basis there will be a debt-fuelled US fiscal binge that will push up inflation,\" said TD Securities' European head of currency strategy Ned Rumpeltin. \"There are signs that higher bond yields and the knock of a stronger US dollar are having a domino impact, taking down the weakest risky assets first, before moving on to the next,\" said Deutsche's global co-head of foreign exchange, Alan Ruskin. And a senior European Central Bank (ECB) has warned that the uncertainty caused by sudden swings in the financial markets threatened economic recovery. Speaking in Frankfurt on Monday, ECB vice-president Vitor Constancio said: \"We should be cautious in drawing hasty, positive conclusions from those market developments, because they may not necessarily indicate that the world economy will have an accelerating recovery with higher growth.\"",

        "He played a key role in advancing the Northern Ireland peace process, including the 1994 IRA ceasefire. The Fianna Fail politician, who was born in Rooskey in County Roscommon, led the party in two coalition governments. He served as taoiseach (prime minister) for just under three years from February 1992 to December 1994. On a biography on its website, Fianna Fail said of Mr Reynolds: \"Without a doubt his greatest achievement was in Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations, signing the Downing Street Declaration in 1993. \"It was Reynolds' determination that gave impetus to the peace process and the establishment of an IRA ceasefire in 1994, followed shortly afterwards by a loyalist ceasefire. \"Albert Reynolds asked the defining question'who is afraid of peace?' \"His determination brought about what had seemed impossible,\" the party added. Former prime minister Sir John Major said Mr Reynolds' willingness to bring different sides together allowed them to \"put aside disagreements\" and retain a good relationship \"to work for a common goal.\" \"I have to tell you, in my experience in politics that this isn't a virtue that every politician has, but Albert Reynolds did,\" he said. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams paid tribute to Mr Reynolds on his Twitter account, saying he acted on Northern Ireland \"when it mattered.\" Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, who is also from Sinn Fein, praised Mr Reynolds' contribution to the peace process. Mr McGuiness tweeted: \"Very sad to hear that former taoiseach Albert Reynolds has died. Deep sympathy to Kathleen and family. Albert was a peacemaker.\" Mr Reynolds became a member of Dail Eireann (Irish Parliament) at the 1977 general election, when he was elected for the constituency of LongfordWestmeath. As Irish minister for posts and telegraphs and minister for transport from 1979-81, he revolutionised the telecommunications system. As minister for industry and energy in 1982, Mr Reynolds developed the National Grid, establishing the gas pipeline from Cork to Dublin. He was minister for industry and commerce in 1987-88 and minister for finance, 1988-91. Mr Reynolds was removed from the cabinet for challenging the leadership of his predecessor Charles Haughey in 1991. However, he assumed the mantle of leadership shortly afterwards in a continuation of the coalition government with the Progressive Democrats. At the beginning of 1993, Mr Reynolds was returned to office in coalition with the Labour Party. Mr Reynolds resigned as leader of Fianna Fail and taoiseach later in 1994, after his coalition partners in the Labour Party pulled out of government because of a controversy that involved the extradition of paedophile priest Father Brendan Smyth. Mr Reynolds had appointed Attorney General Harry Whelehan to the post of president of the High Court. Mr Whelehan had been heavily criticised over his handling of the extradition of Fr Smyth to Northern Ireland.",
        "About 250,000 people have used the free service so far, said its creator, Joshua Browder. The Do Not Pay bot currently works in the UK and New York in the US. It asks a series of questions to determine the validity of a penalty notice. It can also be used to work out compensation for delayed flights. Mr Browder told the BBC he hoped it proved bots could be useful. \"Bots are a huge opportunity for public service,\" he said. \"I'm very surprised it has been so successful, but I am not surprised that so many people have pushed back against their parking tickets.\" Of the 160,000 successful challenges, 9,000 were from New York, where the bot launched in March 2016, reports Venture Beat. Mr Browder was inspired to build the bot, which he describes as \"the world's first robot lawyer,\" after receiving \"countless\" parking tickets himself. It took him three months to program. The Stanford University student is currently building a new bot aimed at helping Syrian refugees by producing English documents based on Arabic text. However, Abhi Chirimar, the chief executive of online mental health community Instawell, said that in his experience there was no chatbot \"silver bullet\" for companies offering digital services across more than one platform. \"Service developers need to be mindful of the pros and cons when designing chatbots,\" he said. \"Chatbots need tactical conversation design to ensure that the average person feels comfortable throughout the process. \"We realised early on that there isn't an easy'silver-bullet' for our chatbot. \"Now, a Facebook user and a Slack user are served up different chatbots for the same goal - get the right kind of help.\"",
        "They cited an unnamed government spokesman saying Friday's strike was an \"intolerable act of aggression against a sovereign state.\" The strikes followed Wednesday's suspected chemical attack on a rebel-held Syrian town which killed 89. North Korea has carried out tests to develop a nuclear missile. The UN has banned it from missile or nuclear tests. But it has repeatedly broken those sanctions. It has successfully tested nuclear bombs of increasing power and claims to have been able to make warheads small enough to fit on a missile, but some experts have cast doubt on those claims. On Friday, US missiles struck a Syrian airbase, killing at least six people. It was the first US attack on a Syrian government facility, although the country had previously targeted the Islamic State group in the region. \"The US missile attack against Syria is a clear and intolerable act of aggression against a sovereign state and we strongly condemn it,\" a government official in North Korea said, as quoted by the KCNA news agency. \"The reality of today shows that we must stand against power with power and it proves a million times over that our decision to strengthen our nuclear deterrence has been the right choice. \"Only military power of our own will protect us from imperialistic aggression. \"We will keep bolstering our self-defensive military might in various ways in order to cope with the ever-intensifying US acts of aggression.\"",

        "In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. \"We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,\" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. \"Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet \"No-drama Obama\" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted \"If you're covered and you know it clap your hands.\" \"This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,\" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. \"The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land.\" \"Today is a good day for healthcare in America,\" said activist Benton Strong. \"I hope this is the end of the line.\" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. \"We should start calling this law Scotuscare\" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. \"Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard of.\" Congressional Republicans have voted more than 50 times to undo the law. House Speaker John Boehner said that they will continue their \"efforts to repeal the law and replace it with patient-centred solutions that meet the needs of seniors, small business owners, and middle-class families.\" Following the enactment of the ACA in 2010, states were given the option of establishing their own healthcare exchanges - online marketplaces for citizens to buy health coverage. Citizens in states that refused to establish exchanges could shop for coverage on a federal exchange. In the court, opponents argued that a phrase included in the law, \"established by the state,\" meant the federal government could only provide subsidies to people in states that set up their own exchanges. However, most Americans receiving subsidies purchase healthcare through the federal exchange, after many states decided not to set up their own marketplaces. Only 13 states and Washington DC have set up their own exchanges. The Obama administration argued that was a too-narrow reading of the law, which spans nearly 1,000 pages, and the rest of the legislation makes clear subsidies are intended for those who meet income requirements, regardless of which exchange insurance was purchased from. Source: Reuters The upholding of the law cements President Obama's biggest legislative victory. Limiting the subsidies could have unravelled Mr Obama's signature healthcare reforms. Republican Congressional leader Steve Scalise said he was disappointed with the ruling and would work to have the law \"repealed and replaced,\" echoing near-universal Republican sentiment. \"It does not change the fact that Obamacare has been a dismal failure for millions of Americans who have lost the good healthcare that they liked, and are paying more for the plans that they have,\" Mr Scalise said in statement.

        "Media playback is not supported on this device The game ebbed and flowed, from the brilliance of Jos Buttler, to Sri Lanka slipping to 15-4, then the hitting of Angelo Mathews taking it to the final over. England know how destructive the competitive Mathews can be - he even scored half of his runs on one leg thanks to a problem with his left hamstring. However, he lost strike towards the end and, after Chris Jordan repeated his knack of bowling excellent yorkers at the death, Ben Stokes was able to defend 15 off the final over. In the end, England were good for their win. Eoin Morgan had the right men in the right places, they took pressure catches and, overall, they kept their cool. That, along with big players putting in big performances, is exactly what T20 cricket is about. In the case of Buttler, England have never had a player so destructive or capable of batting like he does. Media playback is not supported on this device The Lancashire wicketkeeper, who made 66 not out from 37 balls, has a whole range of shots that, when you first see them, appear so risky. However, Buttler has an amazing eye and he practises hard. He has established a technique that works for him, including flat-batted drives through the off side and flicks over his shoulder. He is a formidable opponent. Alongside him is Stokes, who made a serious contribution to such a big, important match. He hit the only ball he faced for six, ran out Lahiru Thirimanne with his first touch in the field, took a steepling catch to remove Chamara Kapugedera, then ensured Sri Lanka did not get the runs they needed off the final over. Earlier in the tournament, Joe Root hit that magnificent 44-ball 83 to lead the chase of 230 against South Africa when defeat would have almost certainly sent England out. On Saturday, he took a brilliant catch in the 19th over. These are key players who relish the biggest challenges and stand up when the going gets really tough. Now, England head to a semi-final, almost certainly against New Zealand on Wednesday, with the advantage of having played twice on this Delhi ground. Media playback is not supported on this device While the Kiwis, unbeaten in topping Group 2, have been relying on their spinners on slow pitches, England have been playing a different, more pace-influenced game. Even with that advantage, England will be the least fancied of the semi-finalists, regardless of who makes it through out of India and Australia on Sunday. But, as we have been saying all along in this tournament, no team has ever gone through an entire World T20 unbeaten and the eventual winners will be the side that peaks at the right time. The last four teams have only two games between them and the trophy. The semis and final will be incredibly difficult to predict because Twenty20 is hard to consistently play well - there's always a different area of your game coming under attack. England should at least be confident of giving a good account of themselves. They are happier chasing, but they have won two games batting first. If everything clicks, and they still have not played a match in this tournament where all departments have - against Sri Lanka the spinners went for a combined 63 runs in four overs - then they have a real chance. When it comes to the pressure moments in a Twenty20, all you can do is stay calm and try to remain in control, even if you are under the cosh. That is what England did against Sri Lanka and, if they can do it in two more matches, they have a chance of repeating the success of 2010.",

Cheshire was regarded as a potential medallist at the Sochi Winter Olympics, but a heavy crash in training resulted in a serious concussion that meant she missed the event. She suffered two further concussions and experienced panic attacks over the next 18 months, only returning to full-time competition this season with under a year to go to the Pyeongchang Games. \"I'm over all of my head injuries,\" she said. \"I'm in a really good place, feeling super-confident and enjoying it more than ever.\" Earlier on Saturday, James Woods and Izzy Atkin qualified for their respective slopestyle finals, which will take place on Sunday. Woods, who finished fifth in Sochi, scored 86.00 to finish fourth in his heat while Atkin, who won GB's first ski slopestyle World Cup gold medal earlier this month qualified in third place.

        "Dr Ian Paterson denies 20 counts of wounding with intent against nine women and one man at Nottingham Crown Court. He said he had never told alleged victims they had \"a ticking bomb\" of cancer inside them. He said the phrase appears in three witness statements which was \"clear evidence\" statements have been coached. \"It's a scary thing, why would I intentionally scare a patient, that you've got a time bomb?\" he said. More updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country The 59-year-old also said one patient, John Ingram, who had a double mastectomy after tests showed only potentially abnormal cells, was a \"quivering mass of anxiety,\" convinced he would get cancer. Nothing he told him would have changed his mind, Mr Paterson said. Mr Ingram gave evidence saying Mr Paterson, who worked at hospitals run by the Heart of England NHS Trust and Spire Healthcare, told him in 2006 he was \"on the road to developing breast cancer.\" But Mr Paterson, of Ashley, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said on Wednesday that Mr Ingram's memory had become \"confused\" over time. He described his patient as a \"troubled gentleman with multiple phobias - one of them breast cancer, because his mother had died of breast cancer, aged 42.\" \"So the minute he had an abnormality in his chest wall, in his head he was on the way to getting breast cancer,\" he said. \"Very little I told him thereafter would disavow him of that view.\" Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC asked whether it was \"quite wrong\" to say he would \"travel in time towards cancer.\" Mr Paterson said: \"I doubt I said that, simply because nobody has a crystal ball.\" The trial continues.",
        "\"I'm feeling the joints for any kind of heat or swelling.\" Veterinary surgeon Dr Sandra Corr puts Daisy the sheep through a very hands-on physical examination. \"I'm looking for any signs of crepitus or lameness,\" she says, \"Anything that might indicate the onset of disease or osteoarthritis.\" But Daisy is not just any sheep. She's a clone. One of a flock of 13 cloned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham, and one of only four (the others are Debbie, Denise and Diane) cloned from the same adult ewe as Dolly the sheep - the first cloned mammal born in 1996. This, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters. \"Where there was one Dolly, with these four girls, now there are five,\" he says. We're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests. As far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation. But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world. According to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results. He tells me: \"One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?\" Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some \"age-memory\" might be transferred into the next generation. \"That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect,\" says Prof Sinclair. \"A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age.\" The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half. Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused lesions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down. But by then Dolly was already suffering from osteoarthritis which, although not unheard of in a sheep of her age, did raise concerns about premature aging. The decision was taken to go back to the original cell line and to produce more clones. \"We wanted to know if Dolly's untimely death was just unlucky,\" recalled Prof Sinclair, \"or if it was something to do with the cloning process itself. If illnesses like arthritis that are associated with old age were more common in cloned animals.\" Getting the answers to those questions has involved putting the dollies, and nine other sheep cloned from different cell lines, through an exhaustive battery of tests and assessments including regular joint X-rays and a series of full-body fMRI scans. Prof Sinclair said: \"We focused on three co-morbidities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoarthritis - the three co-morbidities most associated with aging. Were these animals any different from the wider population of sheep with regard to these particular co-morbidities.\" The results of the study, which could have profound implications for the future of cloning, will be published next week. But for now, the dollies, which are approaching their ninth and tenth birthdays, seem to be in rude health. Follow Tom on Twitter.",
        "Raikkonen was 0.109 seconds clear of his team-mate, with Rosberg 0.237secs off the pace as Ferrari hinted they may offer a threat to Mercedes in Shanghai. Hamilton, with a five-place grid penalty as a result of a gearbox change, was 0.433secs off the pace. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth ahead of Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen. Defending champion Hamilton, who trails Rosberg by 17 points in the standings, said it had been \"a difficult day\" and said it had been \"quite windy\" on the track. He added: \"Ferraris are particularly strong, so I think we're going to have a fight this weekend. \"It seems like we're going to have a bigger fight than we've ever had, so it'll be good for the fans.\" Double world champion Fernando Alonso, who has been cleared to race after missing the last grand prix in Bahrain on medical grounds, was 11th quickest, just ahead of McLaren team-mate Jenson Button. Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix - the third of the season - is live on the Sport website and radio 5 live at 07:00 BST. There was no repeat of the spectacular left-rear failures that afflicted Williams driver Felipe Massa twice and Renault's Kevin Magnussen in the first session. Massa was 14th after the team apparently solved the two wheel failures suffered by the Brazilian in the first practice session. Williams head of performance Rob Smedley said the team were \"fairly confident\" they knew what the problem was but refused to go into details. Valtteri Bottas, who was 10th, said the team had found a problem with the \"rim clearance\" - the distance between the inside of the wheel and the wheel assembly. Magnussen also had a problem with the left rear of his car in the first session. That turned out to be a suspension failure and he did not run in the second session as the team worked on a solution. Ferrari's pace in heading the Mercedes in the timesheets might appear to suggest that they can challenge McLaren this weekend, but Ferrari have flattered to deceive already this season. Vettel, for example, was fastest in final practice at the last race in Bahrain, only for the Mercedes cars to go half a second quicker than the Ferraris in qualifying. \"If we get everything right, we can potentially be a bit closer,\" said Vettel. \"But it is only Friday, so I wouldn't put too much importance in the times.\" Headline lap times can be misleading as teams can manipulate the fuel loads, while the times set on the race-simulation runs on heavier fuel loads can present a more accurate picture. On these, Mercedes had a clear pace advantage, although Raikkonen appeared able to make the super-soft tyre on which the top teams will start the race last longer at a stronger pace than Rosberg and Hamilton.

        "Bids have been submitted by Abellio, Arriva, KeolisAmey and MTR for the next Wales and Borders franchise. The successful bidder will have to make a slice of its profits available to be reinvested in the railway. They will also be responsible for delivering a major upgrade to the rail network in and around Cardiff as part of the Metro scheme. A contract will be awarded in early 2018. The four bids are being assessed by Transport for Wales (TfW), a Welsh government-owned company, as part of what ministers said would be an \"ambitious and creative not for profit model.\" Officials said the four preferred bidders were the only four to come forward for the contract. The Welsh government has set out its ambitions for the Metro but it will be up to the bidders to propose how it will operate, as well as drawing up plans to build a new rail or tram system. Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent This is the first time that the Welsh Government has awarded a rail franchise. It did not have the power to do so when the all-Wales franchise was awarded to Arriva. The model this time will focus on what level and quality of service the various bidders can offer. They will be asked to outline what they will do to drive up the numbers of passengers taking trains and buses across Wales. While the Metro for south Wales will be part of the bid, the company's proposals will also be scrutinised in terms of how they will affect all geographical locations. Whichever company wins will have a cap set on how much profit they can make. We do not yet know at what level that will be set but once that is passed remaining profit will go to the body responsible - Transport for Wales - to be reinvested in public transport in Wales. That cap will be for negotiation. Each company is expected to put together its own particular mix of heavy rail, bus and possibly light rail. The preferred contractor is expected to be known by early 2018. Negotiations are underway with Network Rail about handing over responsibility for the track on the core Valleys lines to the franchise holder. The current franchise is run by Arriva Trains Wales which gets a subsidy from the Welsh Government of between PS150m and PS180m a year. Rail privatisation laws stop the Welsh Government giving the contract to public sector bodies. The Welsh Government has lobbied for more powers, but said its requests have been turned down in Westminster. Officials said in time TfW may evolve to take on more responsibilities, similar to Transport for London. Economy Secretary Ken Skates said new trains, quicker journeys and modernised technology were priorities for the franchise. \"We now have four highly skilled, experienced companies entering the next, competitive phase and I am keen to hear more from them about what they can offer Wales and how they can deliver on our plans for integrated public transport,\" he said. \"Over the next 10 years I envisage significant strides in the delivery of our public transport network including the electrification of the Swansea, Valleys and north Wales lines, a South and North Wales Metro and widespread structural improvements that are already in the pipeline.\"",

It has been reported he could return to his regiment in London, the Household Cavalry's Blues and Royals, which would allow him to carry out more royal engagements in support of The Queen. The duke has said the island has been a \"special place\" for him. His final shift brought to an end a three-year posting on Anglesey. In a speech at Anglesey Show in August, the duke thanked the island's people for being so welcoming to him and his wife. \"I know that I speak for Catherine when I say that I have never in my life known somewhere as beautiful and as welcoming as Anglesey,\" said the duke. \"I know that both of us will miss it terribly when my search and rescue tour of duty comes to an end next month and we have to move elsewhere. \"From the bottom of my heart, thank you for making my wife and me so welcome when we arrived here, as you do thousands of visitors each year.\" He said the island had been their first home together and would always be an \"immensely special place for us both.\" \"Catherine and I look forward to returning again and again over the coming years with our family,\" he added. The duke graduated as a search and rescue pilot in September 2010, having started his training at Valley the previous January. He carried out his first rescue in October 2010 during his first full operational shift.

        "Eight years ago, families living in the coastal Cham fishing villages of Kampot province managed a small coup - they won back fishing rights for the community from the Cambodian government. Since the establishment of the Trapang Sangke community, catches have increased and the fisherman can now earn 6 for half a day's work. The shrimp is dried in a solar drier which was donated to the community by an international NGO, ensuring it is prepared in an hygienic environment, allowing them to charge a higher price. Members of the community are responsible for security, and make regular patrols to ensure there is no illegal logging of the mangrove forest or illegal fishing which could deplete stocks. Tourists are given tours of the area as part of a drive to create an eco-tourism destination. This has brought in extra income, built confidence and improved English skills among the community. As well as western tourists, Cambodian students and tourists are also encouraged, with educational trips seen as an important part of the community's outreach to the next generation. Here a young student from the community plants a mangrove as part of the regeneration plan. Here a fisherman prepares for a night fishing trip. Buyers wait for the boats to return. Now the community has more control over the mangroves, they have eliminated third party buyers who were driving the prices down. In 2014 catches had increased to the point where income from fishing reached a sustainable level for the community.",
        "It was introduced for the final race of 2014 to keep the championship alive for as long as possible but was criticised by drivers, teams and fans. The agreement needs ratifying at a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council, but F1's legislative body is expected to rubber stamp it. The idea of F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, the double points rule was criticised for being unfair and artificial. As it turned out, the outcome of the 2014 championship would have rested on the final race even if double points had not been in force. Lewis Hamilton was 17 points ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg going into the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix but made sure of the title by winning at Yas Marina. That gave the Briton a further 50 points, leaving him 67 in front of Rosberg, who came home 14th after suffering car trouble. Ecclestone and FIA president Jean Todt met with representatives of the teams, circuits and sponsors to discuss a number of proposals at this week's meeting, not just the double points rule. The BBC has learned that they abandoned plans to introduce standing re-starts following the deployment of the safety car but failed to come up with any formal proposals aimed at keeping costs under control. The issue of costs remains a hot topic following the financial collapse of the Marussia and Caterham teams. Force India, Lotus and Sauber have also complained that they are struggling financially because the split of prize money is not equitable. There was also no agreement on allowing limited in-season engine development. Currently, the rules allow a specified amount of development between seasons but none during the championship. Red Bull and Ferrari have been pushing to allow an extra stage of development in the summer. Mercedes are against the idea but have offered to accept a limited amount of development. However, their compromise proposal has been rejected by their rivals on the basis that it does not go far enough. Unanimous agreement is required to change the rules for next season. The World Motor Sport Council, which meets in Qatar on 3 December, will also hear from the investigation into the accident at the Japanese Grand Prix that left Marussia driver Jules Bianchi with severe head injuries. The investigation was charged with establishing what happened and coming up with new measures to reinforce safety at circuits.",

Portuguese national Virgilio Correia, 35, of Grant Avenue in Randalstown, will serve at least 16 years in prison for the murder. Christopher Menaul, 27, from Barra Street in Antrim, will serve at least nine years in jail for the murder. They both also received a further 12 years in prison for wounding with intent, and 12 years for robbery, to run concurrently. The judge said the murder had been carried out by \"drug-addled, parasitic assailants.\" Belfast Crown Court heard that the killers needed money to pay paramilitaries over a drugs debt. Sentencing Correia, the judge said: \"Your decision to take a knife with you had a catastrophic effect and led to an orgy of violence. \"But for your actions, Mr Cheung might still be alive, enjoying the grandchildren he never got to meet because of your senseless cruelty.\" Speaking after the sentencing, PSNI Det Ch Insp Eamonn Corrigan said: \"It was one of the most vicious attacks I have experienced during my service as a police officer. \"The crime was absolutely reckless and I echo the judge's comments that the level of violence used was completely disproportionate to what was to be obtained - this robbery did not require the use of knives.\" He said a major break in the investigation came when police identified the attempted purchase of a hot tub on online auction site eBay using one of the stolen credit cards within an hour of the murder. This led police to an address occupied by husband and wife Gary and Lisa Thompson, who were jailed for their part in assisting the killers. Ballymena man Mr Cheung, 64, ran the Double Value Chinese takeaway restaurant in Randalstown. His wife Kam-Fung, known as Winnie, was also wounded and robbed in the attack. The men had attacked the Cheungs as they drove home after closing their restaurant for the night. Mrs Cheung's handbag - containing PS200 in cash, bank cards, an iPad, an iPhone and several other items - was taken during the incident. Following the murder, she returned to Hong Kong with the couple's children, from where they watched Tuesday's court proceedings. The judge said: \"That pitiful scene at the side of a country road haunts the Cheung family to this day. It is an image they will never put behind them.\" The two men also admitted wounding Mrs Cheung with intent to do her grievous bodily harm, and robbing her. Correia was also sentenced to 12 years in prison for wounding Mrs Cheung and 12 years for robbery, to be served concurrently. Menaul, who was described as \"a secondary party\" in the murder, was also given 12 years for the wounding and robbery, to be served concurrently. Gary and Lisa Thompson, of Felden Avenue in Newtownabbey, admitted assisting offenders by allowing Correia and Menaul to take refuge in their home after the murder, as well as letting them clean themselves and remove clothing. Both also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. Gary Thompson, 34, admitted robbery for which he was sentenced to seven years. He received three years, to be served concurrently, for the other two charges against him. Lisa Thompson, 35, also admitted handling stolen goods. She was sentenced to two years, suspended for two years, for each of the three counts against her, to be served concurrently.",

Part of the garden has a jungle theme with a spray-painted mural and palm trees - during the evening the space is lit by colourful LED lights. Although each ward in the the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales has an indoor play area - until now the children did not have a dedicated outdoor space. Senior nurse Jo Clements said: \"It's got a lovely vibe. Some of the elements are for rehab and physio - different surfaces, different sensory components. \"But there are also parts that are very typical of a playground - a slide, a playhouse where children can just be children again giving them a sense of normality.\" Five-year-old Neve from Abercynon added: \"I really like it.... there's lots and lots of stuff here\" Neve was admitted seven weeks ago after suffering what her parents thought was a sickness bug. But she was diagnosed with an inflammation to the brain called Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis which caused her to lose control of the left side of her body. Neve receives daily therapy to help her regain full control of her arm and leg. With the help of physiotherapists she uses the garden to practice walking and to develop her wheelchair skills. Physiotherapist Natalie Gragasin said the garden can also make therapy seem like play. \"It's a great place for her to come to spend time with her family - obviously when children are in hospital for a long time they're often away from their siblings so it's a lovely place for children just to be children together.\" The children's hospital opened in 2006 and the second phase of its construction was completed in 2015. Funding from the Welsh Government paid for construction work and the equipment has been provided by donations to the Noah's Ark charity.

Discussing austerity, Mr Jones told BBC Wales: \"If we see the Tory plans, we are going to have this until 2020. \"I do not know what the NHS in Wales would look like by 2020, or the education services, if we see those levels of cuts. \"We are just not going to be able to do what we all want to do, so I hope things will change or at least there will be hope in 2015.\" In relation to problems in the NHS, he said: \"If you are straight with people and say'look there are problems in some parts of the NHS, money is not there as it was five or six years ago', they accept that. \"They know you are not miracle workers. \"But what you say to people is, we have prioritised those areas we think are important and also, of course, we have kept our promises on health and other areas,\" Mr Jones added. A Welsh Conservative spokesman responded: \"The greatest threat to Welsh public services is an Ed Miliband government increasing spending and borrowing, leading to crippling interest payments on the national debt, which would significantly reduce the money available to invest in schools and hospitals.\"",
        "The 36-year-old defender, who took up a coaching role at St James Park last year, has not featured in City's first team since the end of February. \"Regarding the playing, I know in my head that things are slowly coming to an end,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I'm not knocking on (manager) Paul Tisdale's door asking why I'm not playing every week, that's for sure.\" Butterfield has been at Exeter for three seasons, having spent eight years at Crystal Palace, where he famously scored a six-minute hat-trick against Wolves in the FA Cup in 2010. \"At the minute it is a little bit of an emergency style usage of myself,\" Butterfield added of his role within the Exeter playing squad. \"We've not openly discussed where we're going forward with that, I'm sure next season it'll be more coaching-based, with perhaps the registration still being held as a'what if'. \"I'm enjoying what I'm doing with Tis (Tisdale) and the rest of the coaching staff and I'm certainly enjoying working with the lads on the coaching front and I hope they're enjoying working with me. \"I'm thankful to Tis for giving me the opportunity to use the transition into the coaching. \"It's a win-win for both as Tis uses me if and when and I'm alongside him every day in training and close to the boys trying to get the best out of them.\"",
        "Siale Angilau, 25, died in hospital after being shot several times by a US marshal in front of the jury at the new federal courthouse. The FBI said he had rushed towards the witness with a pen in an \"aggressive, threatening manner.\" Angilau was the last of 17 accused gang members tried as part of a 2010 case. The case included 29 counts, including assault, conspiracy, robbery and weapons offences. Perry Cardwell, who was in the courtroom with his adult daughter, told the Associated Press news agency at least six shots were fired. \"It was kind of traumatising,\" Sara Jacobson, his daughter, said. The witness on the stand at the time was not identified and was not injured. He appeared to be in his mid-20s and was testifying about gang initiation, Mr Cardwell said. US District Judge Tena Campbell declared a mistrial, writing in her order that members of the jury were visibly shaken and upset. Angilau's lawyer declined to answer questions as he left the court on Monday. The accused had been transferred to federal custody last week after serving time in prison in Utah on other charges. The new federal courthouse in Salt Lake City opened just a week ago. It was designed with several security features, including bulletproof glass in some areas and separate routes in and out for judges, prisoners and the public. The building was closed for a while after the shooting but later reopened.",
        "The new bill, which would affect digital maps from Google, Apple, and Uber, is facing stiff opposition from campaign groups. It also bans \"wrong\" information, including disputed international borders. The government said the rules would not create barriers to business if the bill became law. The bill bans all types of geospatial information, maps, raw data or photographs, acquired by any means, including satellite photography. Offenders could be fined up to 1bn rupees (PS10.4m). It also requires anyone who has already gathered such information to apply for a licence to keep it. It was designed to regulate both the creation and distribution of geospatial information in India \"which is likely to affect the security, sovereignty and integrity\" of the country, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Critics say the definition of geospatial data is so wide it could include printed maps, world atlases, or depictions of the country in international magazines imported to India. The proposed law is likely to cause problems for Apple and Google's map products, as well as services offering \"value added\" geolocation services, such as taxi-hailing app Uber. It is also unclear if companies such as Google would have to go through a separate vetting process every time they updated their satellite imagery - a process that takes up to three months. There is an exemption for government agencies and departments. Google already offers slightly altered versions of its maps inside India, eliminating the Line of Control that divides Indian-controlled and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and locating the whole disputed region within India's borders. Both Google and Uber declined to comment. The laws extend beyond large international companies. Anyone creating, distributing, or owning unsanctioned maps must apply to a government agency for a licence, and submit the material for inspection. The geospatial data will then be considered by a security vetting committee, which will decide if the applicant is granted a licence. Once the material is cleared, it must be watermarked with the insignia of the vetting authority. \"It's only a draft proposal before the country,\" the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, said in a tweet. \"I would appeal not to pass hasty judgment, but put up your suggestions.\" Speaking to the Economic Times, he said: \"It is a general concern being raised that India as a responsible country must have provisions to secure its boundary and territory. \"That is why the bill is necessary. \"It is not a question of sending a message to any firm or company - but it is a question of addressing our own security concern.\" In a country where the number of people owning a mobile phone is rocketing, providing online maps is a big and growing business. If this bill goes through, no-one, from Google to the smallest business, will be able to run their map services in India without a licence. The government will control how anyone uses online maps. When I want to book a cab using a taxi app service, I'm sharing my location with the service to find a cab. The driver uses a map to navigate. When I take a picture and upload it with metadata, I'm creating mapping information that would require a licence. A growing protest online, with the hashtag \"savethemap,\" claims the bill won't just hurt individuals, but also small businesses. Campaigner Sumandro Chattapadhyay says companies such as Uber and Google will survive by getting all their maps vetted by the government. \"But smaller companies have no means to know what kind of geospatial information they can store and what they cannot,\" she says. \"Moreover, if a start-up requires three months to get approvals for your data before you can use it, it'll be as good as dead.\" The bill also bans the publication of such material outside the country, and is designed to apply to citizens of India living and working in other countries, explicitly stating offenders outside India will be subject to the same penalties. \"This act needs to be dropped,\" said managing editor Arup Dasgupta, in a post on Geospatial World magazine's website. \"This act does not, in fact cannot, even begin to comprehend the paradigm shift in geospatial technologies which makes it a non-starter. \"India does need a geospatial information act, but it has to be an enabling and encouraging act that makes for faster and better implementation of programmes, not a regressive and punitive act as the proposed one,\" he said. The bill is still in the draft stage, and government is inviting submissions on it until 4 June.",

        "Donald Skene grappled with worshippers and headbutted prayers posted on the walls of the Taj Madina Mosque in Victoria Road last December. Skene, 38, was ordered to complete 156 days of the unexpired portion of his jail term for breaching his licence. He was also sentenced to a year's supervision following his release. Dundee Sheriff Court was told Skene shouted: \"I'm white but I'm one of you, brothers,\" to the Muslim congregation after being arrested. In CCTV footage shown to the court, Skene was seen entering the mosque's wash room and wandering around crying, as members of the congregation prepared to enter the prayer room. Depute fiscal Charmaine Gilmartin the court: \"His behaviour is bizarre - attempts are made to try and calm him down.\" Skene is then seen running in circles around the prayer room as worshippers speak to him. Mrs Gilmartin said: \"There are various religious texts in glass frames around the room. \"The accused punches some of them and latterly headbutts them. \"He had entered using Islamic greetings, and when he was arrested he refers to members of the congregation as brothers and shouts'I'm white but I'm one of you'.\" Ross Donnelly, defending, said: \"He is very apologetic.\" Skene admitted charges of breach of the peace and resisting arrest. Allegations that the offence was religiously aggravated were deleted by the Crown. The court was told Skene had already spent 10 weeks on remand for the offence.",
        "The blue cloth-covered 1935 edition bears the Nazi dictator's signature on the front fly leaf. It was presented to former BBC and Oxford Mail journalist Peter Cadogan during a visit to Munich in the late 1930s. It will be sold at Silverwoods auction house in Clitheroe, Lancashire, and is expected to raise more than PS1,000. Auctioneer James Thompson said some people \"wouldn't touch anything Nazi with a bargepole,\" but others believe the book should be preserved, despite Hitler's appalling reign. \"In a way, it's a way to touch a monster,\" he said. Mein Kampf, which translates as My Struggle, was first published in 1925 and sets out Hitler's political ideology and plans for Germany. The example being sold is thought to be especially rare because Hitler was known to resist signing documents of any kind. Journalist Mr Cadogan had been acquainted with Unity Mitford, a member of Hitler's inner circle of devotees. It was she who asked Hitler to sign it for him. \"Hitler didn't sign books. It wasn't something he did. He did it this time on the request of Unity Mitford. You can almost see him putting his eyes to the ceiling,\" Mr Thompson added. The book is now being sold at the request of Mr Cadogan's family. The Rev Dr Stuart Jennings, a historian at the University of Warwick, said: \"It's very interesting because it was very difficult to get Hitler to sign anything at all. \"There is nothing to connect him in writing to the final solution. \"There's an interesting social history behind how the book came to be here. After the war and the Nuremberg trials there was a great effort to destroy anything connected to the Third Reich. \"There was a concerted effort to make sure there could be nothing there for idol worship. Even Hitler's bunker was bulldozed over.\"",

West Yorkshire Police said officers had tried to stop the car after seeing the driver \"acting suspiciously.\" Police said the car then \"sped off and collided\" with Dr Platten a short distance away. The matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. A 22-year-old Bradford man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been released on bail. Dr Platten worked at Leeds Beckett University.

        "The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said the Scottish government needed to take action now to avert a staffing crisis. They said rising demand and insufficient nursing staff were putting patient care at risk. The Scottish government said the number of nurses and midwives had risen by 5.2 since 2006. According to the RCN, a \"boom and bust\" approach to staffing had led to many health boards cutting nursing staff to balance their books, then later scrambling to recruit as demand increased. They said despite the vacancy rate for nurses rising to 4.2 in June, the number of available staff only went up by 1 in 2015. They also said the workforce was facing added pressure as the age profile of nurses increased. The RCN said that in 2006, 43 of nursing and midwifery staff were aged 45 or over; in 2015 that figure had risen to 54. The union said that although nurses had been awarded a salary increase recommended by the NHS Pay Review Body, pay restraint had led to a real-terms fall of about 14 in salaries since 2010. They said this was adding to recruitment and retention problems. 54 Nurses aged 45 and over in 2015 43 Nurses aged 45 and over in 2006 RCN Scotland Director Theresa Fyffe said: \"Scotland's population is getting older and more and more people are living with more complex conditions. \"Demand for health care is going through the roof. And you only have to look at the latest NHS vacancy rate - which went up from 3.7 to 4.2 in June 2016 - to know that the very modest increase in staff is just not keeping pace with demand, with a number of health boards really struggling to recruit enough nursing staff.\" She added: \"All these factors, as well as the as yet unknown impact of Brexit on international recruitment - particularly in the care home sector in Scotland are contributing to a'perfect storm' for our nursing workforce and, as today's report says without sufficient nursing staff and exponentially rising demand, patient care is being put at risk.\" Health Secretary Shona Robison said that under the Scottish government, the number of staff working in the NHS had increased by more than 11,000 - including more than 2,100 nurses and midwives, a rise of 5.2, since 2006. She said: \"Rises in nursing and midwifery vacancies are due to the creation of new posts in health boards, mainly as a result of information from our innovative workload and workforce planning tools which help health boards to plan for the number of staff they require. \"We are committed to training and retaining our nursing staff and we will increase the number of trainee nurses and midwives by 5.6 for 2016-17 - a fourth successive rise.\" Ms Robison also said the Scottish government was committed to retaining the nursing and midwifery bursary and free tuition fees in Scotland. Scottish Labour health spokesman Anas Sarwar said: \"The SNP government has ignored previous warnings from staff and that can't be allowed to happen again.\" Donald Cameron, for the Scottish Conservatives, said the government must \"explain why it hasn't created more student places when it knew the workforce was ageing, and why hiring patterns have been so erratic.\"",
        "Kemp, who last played Grant Mitchell in 2006, said it would be \"a brief return.\" \"When I was approached about returning to EastEnders for Barbara's final episodes, it was something I could not turn down,\" he said. Following her surprise return to Albert Square, Dame Barbara announced her character would be killed off. Her character reappeared on Friday, having left in 2010, to tell her eldest son Phil, played by Steve McFadden, that her cancer had returned. After the episode, producers revealed that Peggy would die from the disease in emotional scenes to be screened in the spring. Now Kemp, who played Grant from and then again in 2005 and 2006, will return to bring the Mitchell family back together. \"Barbara is a very close friend, so when I learned of the storyline it felt right that the Mitchell brothers are reunited with their mother for the last time,\" he said. \"I am really looking forward to going back to EastEnders and filming what are set to be some classic EastEnders episodes.\" Grant Mitchell has been one of the soap's most memorable characters in its 30-year history, arriving in 1990 along with brother Phil. He was involved in repeated family dramas including having an affair with his brother's wife, Kathy, and having his brother go on to marry his ex-wife Sharon. \"Grant Mitchell is an EastEnders legend and finally he is returning home to Walford to say goodbye to his mother and be reunited not just with his old loves but also his brother,\" said EastEnders executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins. \"To have the Mitchell brothers come face to face again, having to face losing their mother, is an opportunity to show Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden at their very best.\"",
        "Alberto Paloschi gave the visitors the lead after Angel Rangel's shot fell to him via team-mate Jack Cork. Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski made a series of superb saves, before Nacer Chadli deflected in Kyle Walker's shot to equalise with 20 minutes left. Danny Rose then drove in the winner after Swansea failed to clear a corner. Hopes have been growing at White Hart Lane of a first league title since 1961, but the pressure was on to beat struggling Swansea after Leicester opened up a five-point lead with a victory over Norwich on Saturday. Mauricio Pochettino's side were utterly dominant - managing 34 shots at goal to Swansea's 10 - but were frustrated by determined defending and brilliant goalkeeping. Spurs could have forgiven for thinking it was not going to be their day, particularly when the outstanding Fabianski dived acrobatically to his right to claw out Christian Eriksen's free-kick early in the second half. Fabianski had earlier made an excellent stop to deny Harry Kane from close range, but was finally beaten as substitute Chadli struck and Rose added his first goal of the season. For Pochettino, it was a sign that his players have the character to force victories when fortune appears to be against them. Pochettino's side secured a sixth successive league victory to keep the pressure on Leicester - on a day when neighbours Arsenal lost ground with a defeat at Manchester United. The concern for Tottenham's manager is that his key players steer clear of injury as the attempt to juggle domestic demands with the Europa League. England forward Kane was patched up to play in a face mask after missing Thursday's victory over Fiorentina with a broken nose. There was concern too before kick-off as midfielder Dele Alli, an inspirational figure for them this season, turned his ankle in the warm-up. Alli was able to play the full game, but did not look at his best. Pochettino must hope that the midfielder is in better shape for Wednesday's trip to West Ham. Francesco Guidolin will have been cheered with the spirit his side showed - which was just the pick-me-up that the Swansea manager needed as he battles a chest infection. His side showed attacking guile on their occasional breaks forward, while Paloschi took his goal smartly to score for the first time since his move from Chievo in January. That came after Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris made a superb early save to tip over Gylfi Sigurdsson's shot from six yards, and the France international was alert too late in the game to beat out another Paloschi shot. Guidolin, though will feel a sense of frustration that his team were unable to get anything from the game after leading with 20 minutes left. It means that, after four league games without victory, Swansea remain only three points above the relegation zone. Matches against Norwich, Bournemouth and Aston Villa in March will go a long way towards deciding their fate. Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino: \"Fabianski was great. He was man of the match. Sometimes football is difficult. You play well but find it hard to score. The good thing is that the team fight. It is a fantastic win. \"Our mentality is to look to the next game and go step by step. Now we need to focus again. We have a strong squad and we will try to manage it in the right way.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Swansea first-team coach Alan Curtis: \"Fabianski made some fantastic saves. We thought maybe it would one of those days when we would ride our luck. Lukasz kept us in the game for a long time. \"We got in front and created a couple of decent opportunities but the pressure was relentless. We almost got something but it wasn't quite enough.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Both sides are in Premier League action on Wednesday; Swansea will stay in north London to prepare for their trip to Arsenal, while Tottenham cross the capital to visit West Ham.",
        "Author and academic Sir Anthony Seldon says China's strict schooling style needs to change or its youngsters will suffer, along with its economy. Chinese schools, often criticised for rote and repetitive learning, should be more holistic, says Sir Anthony. The comments come during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the UK. In a speech at the Institute of Education on Wednesday, the president seemed to take on board some of these notions. He said, after watching a BBC programme recreating a Chinese school in England, he had realised that \"the British have learned the virtues of strict discipline\" from China. The Chinese, meanwhile, had been learning the advantages of recreation, he added. \"Chinese children do not play enough. They should play more,\" Mr Xi said. The school day in China's state schools starts at 7am with various physical exercises. Amongst other daily constitutionals, such as Tai Chi, pupils are encouraged to massage their eyes to keep them healthy and get them ready for the day. The children have two meal breaks in the 12-hour school day and will exercise together every day - sometimes twice a day. The teaching style is focused on note-taking and repetition, otherwise known as rote learning. This is a great contrast to England's more interactive teaching style, where pupils are encouraged to participate in class and make judgments for themselves. The Chinese believe children learn faster and better by rote learning Chinese children live under the One Child Policy and feel the weight of responsibility on their shoulders, so there is great importance placed on their educational achievements. Good exam results are associated with social status and success and entire families can pin all their hopes on the single child. Chinese pupils learn the same subjects as English school children in the main, but are combined with practical work experience around the school campus, as well as Chinese culture, morality and ethics. One feature of Chinese schools that England's teachers may welcome is that the pupils almost always are required to clean their own classrooms. China's schools educate an estimated 192,000,000 children - a fifth of the world's school age children. In a speech in Shanghai on Friday, Sir Anthony, now vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said: \"China has some of the top schools in the world and is leading the way with maths and science.\" Indeed Shanghai and Hong Kong are among the top performing districts in the world, according to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development. Sir Anthony added: \"It is the'human' skills that cannot be replaced by computers that Chinese schools and schools worldwide need to be giving far greater focus. \"Many schools are robbing the young of the opportunity to blossom into the unique individuals that they are because too many teachers think that solely cramming pupils' heads full of facts is education. \"Many education systems focus on exams being the sole validators of school, but recent research suggests that jobs with a big growth in salary have been those that require a high degree of social skills,\" he adds. Sir Anthony, former master of leading private school Wellington College, is a great advocate of protecting and enhancing pupils' well-being in order to maximise their potential to learn and express themselves confidently. Like many private schools, Wellington College has an international school in China, where it offers a traditional English public school education.",
        "Rakhmat Akilov reportedly ran from the scene still covered in blood and glass, and was arrested hours later in a northern suburb of Stockholm. He has yet to be identified by police, who have only said that the man in custody is a 39-year-old Uzbek national. Even so, a picture of the man allegedly behind the attack has started to emerge: someone who had failed in his bid to get residency, lost his job and was hiding from police who wanted to deport him. Bumping into a former colleague earlier this year, he revealed he was spending his days \"sleeping and smoking.\" According to reports, he had left a wife and four children behind in Uzbekistan in order to earn money to send home. He had applied for residency in 2014, but had been informed in December 2016 that \"he had four weeks to leave the country,\" police official Jonas Hysing said. He did not leave and, in February, was officially put on a wanted list. A few months earlier, it is claimed he had lost his job after falling asleep at work. He had been working in construction, and was employed by Pierre Svensson for several weeks late last year, helping on an asbestos removal project. Mr Akilov was, he said, \"a reserved person.\" \"He didn't stick out. He did his job. You can't say he was very sociable, we just told him what to do and he did it. He didn't speak much Swedish,\" he told news agency AFP. Mr Akilov was also described as not being particularly religious. One has suggested he \"partied and drank,\" which goes against strict Islamic doctrine. \"He never talked about politics or religion,\" one friend told Swedish daily Aftonbladet. \"He didn't pray five times a day from what I know.\" A co-worker agreed, telling news agency Reuters: \"He was like any normal guy.\" Online, it seems, it was a different story. His Facebook page - which has since been taken down - is linked to a number of extremists through friends and featured at least two propaganda videos linked to IS, one reportedly showing the aftermath of the Boston bombing. He also liked a page called \"Friends of Libya and Syria,\" which says it aims to expose \"terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals\" of the US, British and Arab \"dictatorships.\" However, he was also a fan of pages dedicated to Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova. Despite all this, Mr Akilov was not considered a threat by Swedish security services, who dismissed him as a \"marginal character,\" apparently on the fringes of larger extremist movements.",
        "A Ray Winstone-like voice is programmed to say \"Don't even think about it\" and \"Put it down, put it back\" as soon as the card is removed from the bag. Rebecca Smith, Leanne Fischler and Kirsty Sneddon created the bag for a degree project. The fourth-year students said the design was \"very conceptual.\" All three are in their final year at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee. The bag - designed to be a \"unisex satchel\" - has all the electronics hidden inside a false bottom. A slot has been sewn in for a credit card which conceals an led light and a sensor which acts as a trigger to play the voice recordings. Ms Fischler, 21, said: \"As soon as you take the credit card out, it sends a signal and inside the bag we have a whole load of electronics which we coded ourselves using a platform called Arduino. \"It receives a signal when you take the credit card out and it tells the circuit board that the credit card's moved and it starts to play sequences from our recordings.\" The students said at first the bag tried to deter you from spending money, saying things like \"Don't you think that's a bit much?\" and \"Oh, not again.\" After a while the bag assumes you have made the purchase and starts to \"publicly embarrass you.\" However, if you put the credit card back right away it rewards you with a gruff: \"I knew you could'ear me.\" Ms Smith, 21, told BBC Scotland they had been asked to make a project with an \"element of whispering.\" She said they had designed the bag as a concept, rather than hoping it would be manufactured for the mass-market. \"We're all passionate about using design to create change and starting conversations,\" she said. \"We want people to see it and interact with it.\"",
        "Sir Tim Hunt, who is a Royal Society fellow, reportedly told a conference in South Korea women in labs \"cry\" when you criticise them and \"fall in love\" with their male counterparts. He told the BBC he \"did mean\" the remarks but was \"really sorry.\" The society said Sir Tim's comments did not reflect its own views. Sir Tim, 72, who was awarded the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 2001 for his work on how cells divide, reportedly told the World Conference of Science Journalists: \"Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry.\" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said he was \"really sorry that I said what I said,\" adding it was \"a very stupid thing to do in the presence of all those journalists.\" The British biochemist, who was knighted in 2006, said the remarks were \"intended as a light-hearted, ironic comment\" but had been \"interpreted deadly seriously by my audience.\" He went on to say he stood by some of the remarks. \"I did mean the part about having trouble with girls,\" he said. \"It is true that people - I have fallen in love with people in the lab and people in the lab have fallen in love with me and it's very disruptive to the science because it's terribly important that in a lab people are on a level playing field. \"I found that these emotional entanglements made life very difficult. \"I'm really, really sorry I caused any offence, that's awful. I certainly didn't mean that. I just meant to be honest, actually.\" On his remarks about women crying, he said: \"It's terribly important that you can criticise people's ideas without criticising them and if they burst into tears, it means that you tend to hold back from getting at the absolute truth. \"Science is about nothing but getting at the truth and anything that gets in the way of that diminishes, in my experience, the science.\" Connie St Louis, a lecturer in science journalism at City University, was in the 100-strong audience in South Korea. \"Nobody was laughing, everybody was stony-faced,\" she told the BBC News Channel. \"The Korean female scientists who hosted us looked aghast and he just ploughed on for about five to seven minutes. \"It was just really shocking. It was culturally insensitive and it was very sexist. I just thought,'Where in the world do you think you are that you can be making these kind of comments in 2015? Dr Jennifer Rohn, a cell biologist at University College London, added: \"I think it was clear he was trying to be funny. But people will interpret his comments as having a kernel of truth underneath. And as a Nobel laureate, I know he's a human being, but he does have some sort of responsibility as a role model and as an ambassador for the profession.\" Imran Khan, chief executive of the British Science Association, said Sir Tim's comments were \"careless.\" \"Sadly, dealing with sexism and other forms of discrimination are a daily reality for many people, and I imagine it's hard to find Sir Tim's comments funny if you've been held back by systemic bias for years - whether those remarks were intended as a joke or not,\" he said. The Royal Society, which promotes and supports scientific advances, said: \"Too many talented individuals do not fulfil their scientific potential because of issues such as gender and the society is committed to helping to put this right. \"Sir Tim Hunt was speaking as an individual and his reported comments in no way reflect the views of the Royal Society.\"",
        "The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says it should be made more obvious, before viewers click play, that clips contain promoted products. The regulator wants to see warnings - like \"ad\" or \"sponsored\" - in the video's title or a symbol in the thumbnail. But Ebony Day and Fleur DeForce think that would be a step too far. Fleur de Force has more than one million YouTube subscribers. Lots of her videos are about products and shopping. She told Newsbeat it's important to be open about sponsorship but thinks putting that information in top section of the info bar is enough. \"I've been very vocal about disclosing sponsored content and it does need to be regulated,\" she explained. But she reckons highlighting the fact a video is sponsored in the title would \"distract from the content and send out a bigger message than it needs to.\" \"If you're producing a 30 second piece of sponsored content within a 10 or 15 minute video it's not necessarily the focus of the content,\" she said. \"It almost ruins the content from a creative point of view.\" She added: \"It does need to be clear but we need to work out a better way than putting it in the title.\" Fleur compared vlogging to \"advertorials\" in magazines where it doesn't specifically say \"advert\" in the title. Meanwhile, Ebony Day, who has around 300,000 followers, told Newsbeat: \"The word'advert' on YouTube makes it feel less genuine, you'd hope the person doing it actually likes the product. I probably wouldn't watch it, I'd expect the whole thing to be an advert.\" She thinks it's different to when TV programmes use a logo to let viewers know there is product placement. \"On TV I feel like it's expected but when it comes to YouTube it's not a big company, it's an individual in their bedroom.\" So why is it suddenly a big talking point? The new advice comes after the ASA decided some of Britain's YouTube stars broke advertising rules. In June a group of UK vloggers, including Dan Howell and Phil Lester, were paid to feature a brand of biscuits. However, the videos weren't clearly labelled as adverts. CBBC's Newsround raised the issue with the ASA, which said Newsround had to make a complaint for it to investigate further. After investigating, the watchdog now says the videos should not appear again in their current form. Newsbeat contacted a number of YouTubers and agencies about the new guidance. Many of the content producers seemed concerned, with some seeking legal advice on how to manage their channels in future. Lynsay Taffe from the ASA told Newsbeat: \"We think it's a fundamental right that you can distinguish between when you are watching something that's someone's opinion and when someone is actually trying to sell you something because they've been paid to do that.\" YouTube says vloggers themselves are responsible for making videos that stick to their local laws and regulations. The vloggers affected by the ASA ruling have now changed the descriptions of their videos to make it clear they are paid advertisements, but the ASA said it would be looking at online videos much more closely in future.

        "They may not think they have any data worth stealing but even the smallest company can be custodian to information that represents hard cash to criminal gangs: credit card details, customers' names and addresses, or the designs vital to an innovative start-up - all have a ready criminal market. When attention grabbing headlines such as \"UK suffering 1,000 attacks an hour\" are reported there is a tendency to assume this as an issue only for the larger enterprises; household names that we think of as the powerhouse of our economy. However, that is a dangerous mistake to make. There is mounting evidence that small businesses could be our Achilles heel when it comes to cyber-security. And, it is these small businesses which are the foundations upon which our economy rests: destabilise them and everything else comes crashing down. Over the past 12 months a number of surveys have emerged which suggest that in excess of 60 of these small businesses have suffered some form of successful malware attack. When you realise that even basic security precautions will result in the majority of attacks \"bouncing off,\" you begin to understand they must be quite poorly prepared for the hackers to be so successful. It's not entirely surprising that small businesses are quite so poorly defended. Someone running a small business is not necessarily going to have security as their main priority. They are typically entrepreneurs not security experts. Money is always tight and there is a natural dynamic tension between need and cost. You can see which way the tension is tending when you read in the same surveys that nearly 20 of small businesses only concern themselves with cyber-security following an intrusion. More worrying still, one report indicates that 10 of small businesses would have no way of knowing if they had been successfully attacked. Criminals also recognise that smaller businesses can often be a way of reaching onward to the larger firms. It is as true now as it ever was that the weakest part of a chain is where you should attack, and the supply chains in our modern global, hyper-connected economy are highly extended and, for larger international corporations, you can have upwards of 5,000 to 10,000 smaller suppliers inputting to your end products and services. That represents a lot of potential back doors. To date, selling security software has been akin to selling insurance. Sadly the perception is that it will \"never happen to me\" so smaller businesses put off what they see as a significant expense for what they see as a very remote eventuality. There is even a suggestion in some surveys that smaller businesses are tempted to use unlicensed security software, or, worse, that which they are offered for \"free.\" Unfortunately, such software is far from a protection but is sometimes the very vehicle for carrying malicious software into the companies systems. You should use \"free\" software only if you are sure it is from a reputable company, and that the company which built it provides it directly. As smaller businesses feed the larger businesses, those larger businesses are becoming acutely aware that potentially valuable assets could be at risk somewhere further down their supply chain. Take for example a car manufacturer which designs a cutting-edge headlight design. They don't fabricate the lights themselves but pass the designs to a smaller manufacturer who in turn may subcontract elements of the manufacture. That cutting-edge design, worth considerable sums in intellectual property, can end up with a relatively small business and is then protected using only their security, not that of the large car manufacturer. Hence, if a small business is to join part of one of these large supply chains, they can differentiate themselves from the competition by demonstrating that they can protect the intellectual property entrusted to them to the same degree as it is protected at the start of its journey. An emerging trend is for those who disseminate valuable intellectual property to large distributed supply chains to track and audit who has access to what data. If the smaller business proves to be a source of a leak then they will not be in that supply chain for very long I would suggest. Small businesses cannot put off considering cyber-security any longer. Just as you hire in expertise for doing the accounts, there are many who can advise on the best way to protect you and your clients' valuable data. Failure to do so will ultimately cause the business to fail either through direct losses from an attack, or from being dropped by customers who feel their data is inadequately protected.

        "The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had \"ironclad information\" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and \"pushed hard\" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was \"just not true,\" but he hoped the resolution would \"serve as a wake-up call\" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.\" Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. \"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said. \"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families.... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution \"paves the way\" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January. \"We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,\" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.",

South Yorkshire Police said officers travelled to Kos on Sunday and would hold a press conference on Tuesday at the site where Ben was last seen. Live updates on this story and others from South Yorkshire Ben vanished after travelling to the island with his mother and grandparents who were renovating a run-down farmhouse building in the village of Iraklis. Ms Needham said: \"We believe someone on Kos does know something - and if they do please come forward. It doesn't matter how insignificant they think it is - if they have information let the police know.\" Det Insp Jon Cousins said: \"The lives of Ben Needham's family were ripped apart when he disappeared more than 20 years ago and their determination to find him has not diminished. \"They are more desperate than ever to find answers about what happened to him.\" He said officers would be \"actively\" distributing leaflets and posters and carrying out \"house-to-house visits\" in the Iraklis area. \"It is likely that someone out there knows what happened to him and we will be appealing to people in Kos who have information to come forward and tell us what they know. \"The force is working closely with the Greek authorities to ensure a number of lines of existing enquiry are explored.\" He also said there was a \"PS10,000 Crimestoppers reward available\" for anyone who provided information leading to the discovery of Ben. Earlier this year, the force secured PS450,000 from the Home Office to investigate the disappearance of toddler Ben Needham for another six months. A DNA test was carried out on a man in Cyprus in an attempt to establish if he could be the toddler, but proved negative in 2013. In 2012, a police operation focused on a mound of earth and rubble close to where Ben was last seen, but no trace of him was found.",
        "Grant Clarke was left in urine-soaked sheets and had his emergency buzzer taken away from him, the Nursing and Midwifery Council tribunal heard. The NHS trust responsible said it \"remains appalled\" by the events and apologised to Mr Clarke and his family. But his partner Binny Moore criticised the ruling, which allows two of the three nurses to continue working. Secret camera Ms Moore said: \"It sends a message to staff that choose to abuse patients in their care that it is fine, it's just a slap on the wrist - you can carry on doing what you are doing.\" In May 2012, 43-year-old Mr Clarke, of West Kingsdown, Kent, suffered a devastating brain haemorrhage, leaving him paralysed down his left side, doubly incontinent and unable to swallow or communicate. He was admitted to the West Kent Neuro Rehabilitation unit, run by the Kent Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust. But Ms Moore was so worried about him, she set up a secret camera next to his bed to monitor his treatment. Footage showing Mr Clarke's mistreatment was subsequently broadcast by the BBC. It showed his feeding tube being cleaned with a ballpoint pen and his emergency buzzer being taken away. 'Doesn't care' The Nursing and Midwifery Council suspended staff nurse Vanessa Kennard from practice for 12 months. In its last communication with Ms Kennard, the tribunal heard she was not interested in the case and \"doesn't care what happens.\" The case against her on 10 counts, including the removal of Mr Clarke's buzzer, continued in her absence. Deputy ward manager Marie Banwell received a caution order for 18 months. She had admitted 13 charges but denied nine others. Ward manager Sarah Coulter admitted 13 charges but denied four others. She has been given a caution order for 12 months. The order will not restrict Ms Banwell or Ms Coulter from practice. The trust said both two had undergone extensive training and performance management and had shown genuine remorse for what happened. Mr Clarke's family said they would now pursue a case for civil damages.",
        "Of the 7,532 Spaniards interned at Mauthausen, only 2,335 survived. It is only because of the dogged detective work of a Spanish historian that their memory has not been sullied by an impostor, who 10 years ago was president of Spain's main association of Nazi victims, the Amical de Mauthausen. Enric Marco was exposed shortly before he was due to share a platform at the camp with then Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Madrid-based historian Benito Bermejo, an expert on Spain's deportees, became interested in Marco after meeting him at a conference in 2002. Bermejo found his story especially intriguing as Enric Marco claimed to have been imprisoned in Flossenbuerg, a camp in Bavaria and an unusual destination for a Spanish deportee. Bermejo read all the versions he could find of Marco's past, starting with his claim that he had been an anarchist forced to flee to France from his home city of Barcelona after the Spanish Civil War had been lost. \"I was curious, interested, but then I became very perplexed.\" Marco's] version of events changed each time he told it, both about the camp and how he had got there,\" Bermejo told the BBC. Benito Bermejo also found it mysterious that on the few occasions he tried to talk to him face to face, Marco did not want to discuss his experiences in Nazi Germany. As head of the Amical de Mauthausen, Marco showed a penchant for high-octane speeches packed with horrific details of life in Flossenbuerg. He moved several MPs to tears when addressing Congress on International Holocaust Remembrance Day in January 2005. Searching the foreign ministry archive, the historian found an official request from army command in Catalonia for information on Marco's whereabouts, as he had failed to present himself for compulsory military service in 1943. The foreign ministry replied that Marco was at that time employed by the Deutsche Werke naval shipyard in Kiel, northern Germany. Far from fighting fascism, he had signed up as one of 20,000 Spaniards who worked for the Third Reich under a 1941 agreement between Franco and Hitler. \"So now I know that Marco was not a deportee, that he went to Germany voluntarily and that there is something strange going on,\" says Bermejo. But he still had doubts over the extent of Marco's deception because some volunteer workers who got into trouble with the Nazi regime did end up in concentration camps. Marco was briefly imprisoned in Kiel but never convicted, let alone sent to a camp. For months Bermejo sought an explanation from him. Then, with the 60th anniversary event at Mauthausen days away, he sent a report to the prime minister's office and the Amical association. And he waited. \"What more could I do? I decided that going public with what I knew would be a kind of declaration of war and very controversial at that moment.\" On his way to Austria, the day before the Mauthausen ceremony, Bermejo read in a Spanish newspaper that Marco had had to return to Barcelona as he was \"indisposed.\" In El Impostor, a book by Javier Cercas in which Marco collaborated, the writer suggests Marco was confronted at Mauthausen with Bermejo's findings by his Amical colleagues and that he admitted being a Third Reich volunteer worker. Marco eventually admitted publicly that he had never been in a concentration camp. Now 94, he remains unrepentant about his deception, arguing his aim was to keep the memory of Hitler's Spanish victims alive. \"Who would have listened to me if I hadn't created that persona?\" he said recently. \"It is frightening to think that if he hadn't finally owned up, things could have been very different. The fact that Marco flew to Austria shows how dangerously close we came to a disaster,\" says Bermejo. Enric Garriga, today's Amical de Mauthausen president whose father was deported to Buchenwald, believes the association was damaged by the scandal. \"The figure of Marco, who was a liar, was used to say that everyone was lying.\" For Jose Marfil, also 94 and one of the few genuine remaining Spanish survivors of Mauthausen, the fight to remember must continue. \"We have to do everything possible to keep the existence of those camps alive in people's memory because we [survivors] are going to disappear.\"",

        "The name of each cat killed by Robert Farmer, 26, was read out to him by the judge in Santa Clara Superior Court. One of the cats showed signs of having been sexually abused, experts said. Farmer committed the crimes in San Jose in 2015. He was found sleeping in his car in October that year with a dead cat in the centre console and chunks of fur elsewhere in the vehicle. The cats all went missing in the Cambrian Park area of San Jose in the autumn of 2015. Several pets were found dead, two of them in rubbish bins. The Mercury News website said that video footage from a security camera showed a young man taking a 17-year-old cat named GoGo. Residents pointed police to Farmer. GoGo was among the cats who were never found. Owner Miriam Petrova was at the court on Friday. She told NBC News: \"We finally can say goodbye to every cat that was involved in this tragedy.\" Farmer admitted 21 felony counts of animal cruelty - killing 18 cats and wounding three - along with misdemeanour battery and being under the influence. A letter by him, read out by his lawyer, said: \"It feels like another man committed these crimes, but I know it was me. It's so hard to grasp I did this. I stole a member of their family. The fact that I was out of my mind was no excuse.\" Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Alexandra Ellis dismissed the letter as an attempt to win leniency. \"The judge agreed with my analysis. She sentenced him to 16 years, we can only hope it is long enough,\" she said. Farmer was also banned from owning or caring for a pet for 10 years after his release, and was given a restriction order keeping him away from Cambrian Park.",

After being sent to the stands by referee Jon Moss, Wenger moved away from the pitch but stood at the tunnel entrance and refused to move as he tried to watch the remaining few minutes of Sunday's match. As Taylor encouraged him to move away, Wenger was seen to push back against him. Arsenal were then given a penalty of their own, which was converted by Alexis Sanchez. Immediately after the match, Wenger apologised, saying: \"I should have shut up - I apologise for not having done that. \"It was nothing malicious.

        "In the footage, which has been widely shared on social media, the policeman headbutts, slaps and kicks the driver as they quarrel beside the lorry. The incident happened at Wadi Joz, an Arab area in occupied East Jerusalem. Police said the officer involved had shown \"severe and unusual behaviour\" and had been placed on forced leave. The video, which was recorded by a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, has been passed to the police investigation unit. Apparently filmed on a dashcam of another vehicle, it shows the officer remonstrating with the lorry driver. The Jerusalem Post newspaper said the incident reportedly arose over an issue with the parking of the lorry. The Palestinian appears to be explaining something and emphasising a point, whereupon the officer headbutts him and slaps him back and forth across the head. As the driver clutches his head and bends over, the policeman knees him in the stomach then punches him on the back of the head. At this point, two more individuals arrive and start remonstrating with the policeman, who shoves one of them backwards. He pushes back at the policeman, who then kicks out at him. The edited video then cuts to a moment where the second man apparently strikes the policeman on the side of the face, before a third man steps in and tries to calm the policeman down. The footage drew outrage from Israeli Arab politicians. Member of the Knesset Ahmad Tibi called for the officer to be arrested and prosecuted. \"It is brutal behaviour of mafia and gang members, not people who are responsible for law and order,\" he said. Israel's Public Security Minister, Gilad Erdan, condemned the officer's actions. \"There is no place for such behaviour in the [police] force and I hope that the police investigation unit will prosecute him to the full extent of the law,\" he said.",
        "The motoring organisation also called for extra funding for road repairs in the chancellor's Budget next week. The Local Government Association (LGA) said there was a PS12bn backlog in road repairs that would take councils \"more than a decade\" to clear. The UK government said it was providing \"unprecedented levels of investment.\" In an AA survey of 25,208 drivers, 39 said their tyres, bodywork or other parts of their vehicles had been affected after hitting a pothole in the past two years. AA president Edmund King called on local authorities to \"get to grips with fundamental road maintenance\" such as poor drainage and crumbling surfaces. He also said Chancellor George Osborne should allocate extra funding for road repairs to \"reverse the toll on vehicles and their owners' pockets.\" LGA transport spokesman Peter Box said current funding levels and the repairs backlog meant councils \"can only keep pace with patching up our roads and filling potholes.\" \"Long-term and consistent investment in local road maintenance is desperately needed,\" he added. Road maintenance is devolved to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Transport Minister Andrew Jones said the government had allocated a \"record PS6bn to councils in England to improve local roads over the next five years.\" \"We topped this up with PS250m last year specifically to tackle the blight of potholes,\" he said. A Scottish Government spokesman said in the last financial year more than PS220m was allocated for the maintenance of motorways and trunk roads, which it said was 20 more than five years ago.

The appeal process meant the 28-year-old Irishman was free to play in Tuesday's 1-0 win over Hamilton, which took the Dons five points clear at the top of the Premiership. However, he will miss Saturday's visit to Hearts and the following midweek League Cup meeting with Hibernian. Speaking after the win against Celtic, Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes thought the red card was harsh. \"It's not a two-footed challenge,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"If he [referee Craig Thomson] sees again, I'd be surprised if he thought it was a red card but it is what it is.

        "Correspondents said the atmosphere at schools was subdued and many pupils had not returned. They said parents had been taken by surprise by the government's decision to reopen schools with only four days' notice and many were not prepared. More than 8,400 people have died in West Africa in the world's worst outbreak of the Ebola virus. The reopening of schools in Guinea comes four days after the UN said the number of confirmed Ebola cases in the country had fallen to its lowest weekly total since August. At one school in the Guinean capital, Conakry, only about 220 of the approximately 2,000 pupils were reported to have returned. Of the 36 teachers, more than half were back at work. Many schools have introduced health precautions, including hand-washing and temperature checks. Ebola has had a severe impact not only on public health but also on the Guinean economy. Unemployment and underemployment have risen, leaving many parents with difficulties meeting school-related expenses at the beginning of a new academic year. Schools remain closed in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the two other countries hit hard by the Ebola outbreak.

        "Slovakia is launching a legal challenge to mandatory quotas that were passed in a majority vote on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Hungary's prime minister has proposed a radical budgetary revamp to raise funds. The summit will focus on tightening EU borders and aiding neighbours of Syria, from where many migrants come. The talks were continuing well into the night, having started just after 19:00 Brussels time (17:00 GMT). Draft proposals seen by the BBC, that are being discussed at the summit, include: European Council President Donald Tusk called for \"a concrete plan\" to secure the EU's external borders, \"in place of the arguments and the chaos we have witnessed in the past weeks.\" As she arrived at the summit, Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite said it was \"not a lack of European unity, but a lack of European wisdom\" that had led to this point. On arriving, British Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK would be giving another PS100m (152m) to help Syrian refugees, including PS40m towards the World Food Programme. \"We need to do more to stabilise the countries and the regions from which these people are coming,\" he said. The UK has opted against taking part in the relocation scheme and has its own plan to resettle migrants directly from Syrian refugee camps. The scale of the problem was highlighted again on Wednesday when Croatia revealed that 44,000 migrants - including 8,750 on Tuesday - had arrived there since Hungary completed a fence along its border with Serbia last week. Analysis: Chris Morris, BBC Europe correspondent As thousands of people continue to arrive on European shores, EU leaders are trying to focus on longer term solutions, to try to stem the flow. The EU can't ignore the divisions and disagreements that have emerged in the last few weeks between member states that have different ideas about how this crisis should be confronted. One EU official said there was a need to clean up the bad blood around the table. Progress may be made this evening, but it will take years of political engagement to make a significant difference. And there will be more bumps in the road. Relocation deal explained Hungary proposes its own deal Why central Europe says'No' One young Syrian's story On Tuesday, in a rare move for an issue involving national sovereignty, EU interior ministers approved the resettlement scheme by majority vote rather than unanimous approval. The deal will see thousands of migrants moved from Italy and Greece to other EU countries. A proposal to take 54,000 migrants from Hungary was dropped. The plan's opponents have lashed out. However, Czech PM Bohuslav Sobotka said on Wednesday it would not launch a court challenge, adding: \"Europe must not fall apart on the migration crisis.\" Romania said it could manage its allocation but President Klaus Iohannis insisted mandatory quotas were not the answer. The UN has warned that the relocation alone would not be enough to stabilise the situation. Close to 480,000 migrants have arrived in Europe by sea this year, and are now reaching European shores at a rate of nearly 6,000 a day.

        "They urged Palestinians to re-enter the compound on Thursday for the first time since the crisis erupted two weeks ago. The last remnants of Israel's recently installed security apparatus were taken away on Thursday morning. Palestinians had fiercely objected to the measures introduced after the killing of two Israeli policemen. They had refrained from entering the Old City complex known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount in protest over what they saw as an Israeli attempt to exert control over the contested site. Last week Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he was freezing all contacts with Israel, including security co-operation, until Israel cancelled the new measures. There have been intensive diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis, involving the US and Jordan, which is custodian of the holy site and has a large Palestinian population. The Israeli government has not yet commented on its decision to completely dismantle the infrastructure. Observers say it is a climbdown by Prime Minister Netanyahu which will put him at odds with more right-wing members of his cabinet. In a separate development, Mr Netanyahu accused the Qatar-funded pan-Arab al-Jazeera TV channel of fuelling the crisis. \"The al-Jazeera network continues to stir violence around the Temple Mount,\" he posted in Hebrew on his Facebook page, vowing to \"enact the required legislation to expel al-Jazeera from Israel.\" Palestinians sang, danced and let off fireworks as railings and security camera gantries were removed from the Lions' Gate entrance near the Temple MountHaram al-Sharif in the early hours of Thursday morning. \"For 12 days no-one has slept, no-one has done anything except the al-Aqsa mosque,\" bystander Firas Abasi told AFP news agency. He said he felt like crying over what he called a \"victory.\" Mass prayer gatherings had been held in the street outside the Old City walls and near-daily clashes between Israeli security forces and demonstrators have taken place since the metal detectors were introduced in the wake of the killings of the policemen near the site on 14 July. Four Palestinians were killed and three Israeli civilians stabbed to death by a Palestinian who said he was avenging Israel actions at the site. Israel said the security measures were necessary because the weapons used to kill the police had been smuggled on to the compound. Earlier this week, it said it would bolster its police presence around the site and introduce less obtrusive security measures over the next six months, including unspecified \"advanced technologies.\"",
        "Defeats by Munster, Edinburgh and Ulster were followed by a run of nine wins in 11 Pro12 and European games, including a win against Toulon. Ospreys beat Scarlets 19-9 on Tuesday. \"Hopefully it's just a glitch. We'll see next week if it's a huge step back,\" Owens told BBC Radio Wales. \"We've bounced back well, we didn't have a great start [losing first three games] but we've built momentum. \"We've got some great performances in during the international period and over the last couple of weeks.\" Scarlets are fifth in the Pro12 following the Ospreys defeat but Owens is optimistic about their progress this season after a poor start to their league campaign. \"You can't win every game in the season and, as long as we turn up with a huge win against the Blues, then we'll be back in that winning groove again,\" Owens continued. \"You can't go all season winning every game, it's not going to happen, so we will put ourselves in a position now from the start we had.\" Scott Williams says Ospreys' kicking game proved vital in the defeat and says they need to look at themselves closely before facing Cardiff Blues on New Year's Day. \"We knew it was going to be close but there were too many mistakes and too many penalties,\" Williams said. \"Our defence has been pretty good the last couple of weeks but you can't be giving penalties away when they've got boys like Dan Biggar and Sam Davies in their team. \"We'll be tough on ourselves now. We've got another derby in four days so we've got to get our heads on for that and make sure we turn up.\"",

        "On Monday it emerged a pit bull named Stella had been kept in a 3ft by 9ft cage for two years without exercise. Now former kennel workers have released a video showing both Stella and a seized Rottweiler named Vinnie. Devon and Cornwall Police said \"immensely frustrating\" delays in the judicial process left Vinnie in kennels for two years before he was destroyed. The video, taken on the day Vinnie was put down, shows kennel staff playing with Vinnie while Stella, in the kennel next door, rubs noses with the Rottweiler through the metal mesh. The BBC understands Vinnie had been trained as a guard dog and police said he was used to attack three people in 2013. He was seized and placed in kennels but the court process took two years before a destruction order was carried out around 26 July 2015. Former staff at the kennels say Vinnie had a \"Do Not Enter\" sign on his kennel and, as far as they were aware, was not let out for a period of two years. Laura Khanlarian, who until December 2015 worked as an assistant at the private kennel used by Devon and Cornwall Police, said: \"To move him from one cage to another he just went through the internal doors. \"He wasn't assessed like Stella so he really didn't leave the kennel at all. \"Vinnie had no contact until the day he was put down. I made that video an hour before when we were allowed in his kennel with him.\" Another former worker at the kennel, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Vinnie the Rottie had no human contact except being fed. He was deemed too dangerous to get out. \"But this was the dog that, once he knew you, wagged his tail, pushing himself against the bars, desperate for any attention. \"As far as I know he belonged to a man who trained him as a guard dog. Because he was possibly trained to bite we were told not to walk, go in with him, same as Stella as he was too dangerous.\" Former staff at the kennels have told the BBC they offered to work with Vinnie and exercise him but were not given permission to do so. After the BBC revealed Stella's plight, Devon and Cornwall Police Chief Superintendent Jim Nye said: \"The welfare of dogs is extremely important to us. \"In the past year we have seized in the region of 100 dogs, and only Stella has been assessed as too dangerous and unpredictable for kennel staff to walk.\" Following the release of the latest video, the force did not say if they or another body had ordered Vinnie - who is understood to not be among the last 100 dogs seized - to be kept without human contact. However, in a statement they said: \"Vinnie the Rottweiler was a dog seized and placed into kennels in 2013. \"Vinnie was a legal breed and was seized after it had bitten three people. Later the courts granted a destruction order on the dog who was put to sleep in the early to mid part of 2015. \"Within the last 100 dogs we have seized only Stella was deemed too dangerous to be exercised and instructions given to the kennel specifically in relation to this. \"It is important to stress that despite the very best effort of the police, the judicial process is not accelerated when a dog is placed in kennels. This is immensely frustrating for the police who hold animal welfare in the highest regard.\" No-one from the kennels has commented.",
        "Johnny Sexton's 15th-minute penalty was the only first-half score as Connacht produced some stout defending. However, Leinster upped the pace after Sean O'Brien's introduction and Josh van der Flier's try put them in control and Sexton kicked the conversion. Ian Madigan added a penalty as Connacht suffered a third straight Pro12 defeat. In contrast Leinster, despite having lost all four of the their European Champions Cup games, have now earned six straight wins in the Pro12 to move to within a point of leaders Scarlets, who were edged out 29-27 by Cardiff Blues on Friday. Early-season leaders Connacht will drop to fourth place if Ulster defeat Munster at Kingspan Stadium on Saturday. Van der Flier's crucial 61st-minute try was awarded by referee George Clancy after his consultation with TMO Marshall Kilgore even though replays appeared inconclusive. However, Leinster deserved their victory as impressive displays from Eoin Reddan and O'Brien, making his 100th appearance for the province, helped them control most of the second half after being contained despite playing with a wind advantage in the opening period. Sexton's penalty on the quarter hour mark was the only score of a bruising first half with Connacht repelling several threatening attacks from the home side. Connacht were close to snatching a try before the break with Leinster's Ireland wing Dave Kearney making a vital intervention to bundle Niyi Adeolokun into touch after Tiernan O'Halloran's grubber kick. Kearney's initial burst into the Connacht 22 helped set up van der Flier's try on 61 minutes although replays suggested that he may have been held up by John Muldoon. A couple of other refereeing decisions appeared to go against Connacht - including an apparent missed knock-on by Rob Kearney near to his own line - as Bundee Aki attempted to inspire a rally from the visitors with some strong running. Madigan's late penalty confirmed Leinster's victory as they moved to within a point of the Scarlets with also a game in hand. Leinster coach Leo Cullen: \"To be only 3-0 up at half-time left after having had the wind advantage definitely left us with a bit of a mountain to climb. \"But in the second half, we controlled the ball well in difficult conditions and we're delighted to come away with a win and to keep Connacht scoreless as well.\" Leinster: R Kearney; F McFadden, G Ringrose, B Te'o, D Kearney; J Sexton, E Reddan; J McGrath, R Strauss, M Moore; D Toner, M McCarthy; R Ruddock (capt), J van der Flier, J Murphy.

        "Castlepoint in Bournemouth opened in 2003 but the two-level car park has been reinforced with props since 2005 when it was found to be unsafe. Bournemouth Borough Council has granted planning permission for it to be demolished and rebuilt in sections. Work is expected to be completed by Christmas 2018. Sean Jeffery, managing director of Kier Infrastructure UK, which built the shopping centre, said: \"This is very welcome news. Together with the Castlepoint Partnership, we have worked hard to reach this stage. \"There remain a few key steps to put in place, but this consent brings us closer to being able to start work on-site.\" The rebuild has been delayed for years as a result of legal wrangling. Standard Life Investments, which manages the centre on behalf of Castlepoint Partnership, would not reveal the cost of the rebuild but said there would be no cost to tenants. To minimise disruption, work will be carried out in five phases, each taking nine to 10 months, stopping for six weeks each Christmas. Additional parking will be created underneath existing stores to maintain at least 2,500 spaces - the amount needed at peak times. When the project is complete, the additional spaces will be turned into more shops. The walkways in front of the upper level stores will also be replaced in phases.",
        "Beji Caid Essebsi, who won the first round with 39 of the vote, is challenging interim leader Moncef Marzouki. Mr Essebsi represents the secular-leaning Nidaa Tounes party. Tunisia was the first country to depose its leader in the Arab Spring and inspired other uprisings in the region. Polls closed at 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT). Voter turnout had reached 36.8 after four and a half hours of voting, Tunisia's election authority said. Shortly after polls closed, Mr Essebsi's office said that there were \"indications\" that he had won. However, a spokesman for Mr Marzouki said the claims were \"without foundation.\" Mr Essebsi, who turned 88 this week, held office under both deposed President Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali and Tunisia's first post-independence leader, Habib Bourguiba. He is popular in the wealthy, coastal regions, and based his appeal to voters on stability and experience. His opponent, Moncef Marzouki, is a 67-year-old human rights activists forced into exile by the Ben Ali government. He has been interim president since 2011 and is more popular in the conservative, poorer south. After casting his ballot, Mr Marzouki said Tusinians \"should be proud\" of themselves \"because the interim period has come to a peaceful end.\" Mr Marzouki was thought likely to attract support from the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, which has played a key role in Tunisian politics since the Arab Spring but did not field a candidate. Whoever wins faces restricted powers under a constitution passed earlier this year. The president will be commander-in-chief of the armed forces but can appoint or sack senior officers only in consultation with the prime minister. The president will also set foreign policy in consultation with the prime minister, represent the state and ratify treaties. Tunisia boosted security for the elections and closed border posts with Libya, which has been plagued by unrest. A group of at least three attackers targeted a polling station near the city of Kairouan on Sunday morning. Security forces say they killed one attacker and arrested three. In the build-up to the vote, a video emerged of Islamic State militants claiming responsibility for the 2013 killings of two Tunisian politicians. The men in the video also condemned the election and threatened more killings. An interior ministry spokesman dismissed the video, saying the group \"mean nothing to us.\" About 5.2 million Tunisians were eligible to vote in the run-off poll. At least 88,000 observers oversaw the election, according to Tunisian state media.",

Town trustee Graham Mottram, said: \"Our major challenge is to put the monument back together again using as much of the original material as we can.\" The cross is a Grade II-listed building, which dates from about 1795. Mr Mottram said they will need to find a stonemason and \"some pretty big lumps of ham stone\" to replace the column. \"The base has been dismantled by the impact and we're going to have a structural survey as to what needs to be done to stabilise the base,\" he said. \"I certainly expect it will cost us a five-figure sum, running into six.\"",
        "Heavy rain seemed to have scuppered any hope of play on a night just three matches from seven got under way, and only two ended with a positive result. The Jets chased down Leicestershire's 88-2 to win thanks to Paul Coughlin (38 not out) and Paul Collingwood (34). In the South Group, Hampshire beat Gloucestershire by 24 runs in Bristol. Gloucestershire scored 175 in 19 overs, with Australian Michael Klinger hitting a magnificent unbeaten 101 from 58 balls, which included six sixes and seven fours. But openers James Vince (42) and Rilee Rossouw (45) ensured the visitors were always ahead of the run chase. The reached 121-3 to earn a 24-run victory courtesy of the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern system when the rain forced an early end. The victory lifted Hampshire four places to third in South Group. Durham Jets appeared to be facing a seventh straight defeat in this season's competition when a Luke Ronchi-inspired Leicestershire made 88-2 from their seven overs at Grace Road. The New Zealander smashed a six and five fours from James Weighell's first over and went on to make 63 from 21 balls. Despite losing both openers cheaply, former England batsman Collingwood and Coughlin teamed up to guide the away side to an unlikely victory However, there was drama in the final over as Collingwood and Jack Burnham were run out off successive balls before Coughlin hit the winning boundary as rain poured down across the ground.. \"It was a bit of a surprise that we managed to get out there, the outfield was really wet,\" Collingwood told BBC Newcastle. \"But, when you've got a win under your belt, your first win, you don't mind. I thought the guys showed a lot of character. \"Things hadn't been going easy in T20 this year, but to stand up and chase that total down after what was pretty much a Luke Ronchi blitz in the first innings, was a great effort.\" Despite the victory, Durham remain bottom of North Group, with Leicestershire dropping two places to sixth. Sussex and Middlesex managed to make a prompt start to their match in Hove, but were eventually beaten by the rain which swept across the country. Middlesex were chasing a fourth T20 victory of the season and reached 136-6 from 17.4 overs when the players were forced off for the second time. Captain Brendon McCullum smashed a quickfire 26 early on, but he fell to Chris Jordan and some impressive fast bowling from Jofra Archer (2-17) kept the visitors in check. The worsening conditions meant the Sharks reply never got under way with the match abandoned just after 21:30 GMT. The games between Lancashire and Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Northants, Birmingham and Yorkshire, and Glamorgan and Surrey were all called off before a ball could be bowled.

        "Fifty lodges from around Ireland, along with visiting Orangemen and women, attended the event. The parade, accompanied by 30 bands, made its way along the rural coastal setting into the centre of the seaside village before a religious service. Many families with young children gathered at vantage points along the route to take in the demonstration. County grandmaster David Mahon said Donegal prides itself on being a family-friendly day with a relaxed atmosphere. The parade is the traditional opener to the annual 12 July celebrations marking King William III's victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Assistant Grand Master Stuart Brooker told the crowds the institution was \"being challenged on many fronts.\" \"One of the biggest issues we currently face is organised opposition to our traditional parades, and in this respect, we are branded intransigent, and insensitive,\" he said. \"We have responded by challenging ourselves. And I believe that we have responded in a responsible manner, by reaching out to the wider community as never before.\" He added that they have done so \"in a spirit of openness and goodwill, evidenced in the success of the Twelfth here in Rossnowlagh.\"",
        "The former Tory MP, 67, defeated UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill to lead the party's seven-strong assembly group. Mr Farage said he was \"not particularly in favour of Mr Hamilton's return to the front line, aged nearly 70.\" Mr Hamilton replied: \"If Attenborough can still survive in a jungle of wild animals and predators at 90, I'm sure I'll be fine in the assembly.\" Mr Farage, who is 15 years younger than Mr Hamilton, had described the treatment of Mr Gill as \"an act of deep ingratitude\" after UKIP won its first seats in the assembly. Speaking about Mr Hamilton on LBC radio on Friday, Mr Farage said: \"I think it is difficult to return to frontline politics after a 20-year gap when you are getting on a bit in years. \"But there you are, perhaps he'll surprise me.\" He added: \"One thing I will say, he is utterly committed to this EU cause, and he has been since the 1960,\" referring to Mr Hamilton's opposition to UK membership of the European Union. In response, Mr Hamilton said: \"The average UKIP member will be very disappointed at Nigel's ageist remark. \"UKIP has many thousands of active and vigorous senior members. \"It seems particularly odd to knock old age at the very moment we celebrate the 90th birthdays of two icons of Britishness - Her Majesty the Queen and Sir David Attenborough. \"If Attenborough can still survive in a jungle of wild animals and predators at 90, I'm sure I'll be fine in the assembly. \"Clement Atlee was 65 when, as Prime Minister, he introduced the NHS. \"Churchill was 72 when he led us to victory against the Nazis. \"Ronald Reagan was 77 when he brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union and ended the Cold War. \"Is Nigel suggesting he could have done a better job than any of them, because he is 15 years younger than me?\" Among those who supported Nathan Gill in the leadership vote last week was Mark Reckless, a former Conservative MP and now a AM for South Wales East. Asked what the relationship between Mr Hamilton and Mr Gill was like, Mr Reckless said: \"Not good.\" \"I hope over time wounds will heal and we'll want to do the best for the people who voted for us and Wales as a whole,\" he told BBC Wales on Thursday. Mr Reckless said he had supported Mr Gill in the leadership challenge, but added: \"I accept the result.\" Of Mr Hamilton's bid to go for leader, Mr Reckless said: \"It's not what I would have done, but we are where we are. \"I don't want to say anything critical about Neil on that.\"",
        "Blues built a 14-3 lead with tries by Lloyd Williams and Gareth Anscombe. Hallam Amos hit back before the break, Nic Cudd followed up and they earned a penalty try. Josh Navidi went over as Blues staged a late challenge, but the hosts held on to earn a last-four clash with Edinburgh. The talking points began well before kick-off. Dragons boss Lyn Jones named Wales number eight Taulupe Faletau on the bench with Nick Crosswell preferred in their starting back-row. Blues picked former Wales and British and Irish Lions prop Adam Jones on the bench and they suffered a late blow when Argentine Joaquin Tuculet failed a fitness test. Scrum-half Tavis Knoyle took over at centre with Lewis Jones coming on to the bench while Scott Andrews was picked at tight-head ahead of Jones. That meant four of the Blues' changes were enforced, with fly-half Rhys Patchell, centre Cory Allen and makeshift midfielder Tuculet injured and Lucas Amorosino ineligible. The opening period belonged to the visitors as they built a 14-3 lead by exploiting Dragons' defensive frailties. Jones' side were exposed time and again through fly-half Anscombe, wing Alex Cuthbert and scrum-half Williams. When centre Jack Dixon allowed Cuthbert a gap, the wing set up the ruck from which Williams squeezed over and Anscombe added the extras. Wing Tom Prydie kicked Dragons' first points, a penalty before Anscombe's try extended the Blues' lead. This time the New Zealand-born Wales hopeful made the most of a hesitant home defence to dart over, again converting. Dragons' fightback began when Anscombe returned the favour to the hosts by picking the wrong defensive line. Anscombe was attracted by Jack Dixon's presence to allow wing Amos the time and space to burst clear. Prydie's conversion made it 14-10 to the Blues at the break. Poor line-out defence allowed Dragons to seize the initiative and after Faletau led the phase-play charge, replacement flanker Cudd reached the line. Blues' implosion continued as Jonathan Evans charged down Williams' clearance. The visiting scrum-half then tried to drag his opposite number back and referee JP Doyle awarded the penalty try, converted by Prydie Williams was also sin-binned, but was back as Blues launched their late effort to regain the lead after home fly-half Dorian Jones' penalty. A dominant scrum allowed Navidi to touch down and Anscombe to convert, but Dragons thwarted Blues' final assault to seal victory.

        "The public car park is just off the Upper Newtownards Road, one of the main routes into the city. Thousands of wooden pallets are now piled up where previously there were parked cars. The bonfire makers are involved in a dispute with the city council over the storing of pallets. They say the council collected pallets from the area earlier this year, agreed to store them and return them this month but failed to do so. Bonfire builder Macauley McKinney, 21, said: \"We had an agreement with the council that they were going to store the pallets in a safe place, and now because the agreement was broken, they've let us down.\" Belfast City Council is not commenting in detail on the issue, as an investigation has been called into the storing of pallets. A spokesperson said: \"It was agreed at a meeting of Belfast City Council's Strategic Policy and Resources Committee on Friday that an investigation and full review, led by the chief executive with independent input, would be carried out into the issue of collection and storage of bonfire material, and the future approach of bonfires across the city.\" The committee's decision needs to be approved at a full council meeting next week.

        "Gabriel Sakellaridis was speaking after Mr Tsipras won the late-night vote convincingly, but with more than 30 of his own MPs voting against him. The vote means the government lost its majority but is expected to survive. Eurozone finance ministers are due to discuss the vote in a conference call. On Wednesday the European Commission proposed a EUR7bn (PS5bn) \"bridging\" loan to help Greece pay debt interest due in several days. Live updates Under the terms of the bailout deal agreed in Brussels on Monday, the first tranche of legislation relating to tax and pensions had to be passed by Wednesday. The Greek parliament discussed the bailout deal beyond a midnight deadline into Thursday morning. Mr Tsipras won the vote by 229 votes to 64, with the support of some opposition MPs. See how events unfolded here The BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens says he has been weakened and will now need a reshuffle or a vote of confidence. Passionate opposition came from his own party, with parliamentary Speaker Zoe Constantopoulo calling the measures \"social genocide.\" Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was another vocal opponent of the measures. Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and Deputy Labour Minister Dimitris Stratoulis also voted against the package, prompting speculation they could lose their jobs in a reshuffle. In his address to parliament Mr Tsipras said: \"I acknowledge the fiscal measures are harsh, that they won't benefit the Greek economy, but I'm forced to accept them.\" He added: \"The Greek people can understand the difference between those who fight in an unfair battle and those who just hand in their weapons.\" He also said it was a \"positive development\" that one of Greece's creditors, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), had suggested that the bailout does not go far enough - and that some debts will need to be written off. Mr Sakellaridis said the vote was the first important step towards a deal and hinted that the government would try to remain in office despite losing its majority. \"The basic priority of the prime minister and the government is the immediate and successful completion of the agreement,\" he said. When Eurozone finance ministers hold their conference call at 08:00 GMT they will discuss the next steps. Later, the European Central Bank's governing council will meet to discuss how to keep Greece's banks from collapsing. Greek banks have been closed for more than two weeks to reopen, with cash withdrawals limited to EUR60 a day. For Greece to secure its new funds, it must win the approval of the domestic parliaments of several of the other 18 members of the eurozone. Germany is expected to vote on the deal on Friday. Greece must also commit to a major overhaul of the civil justice system by 22 July and agree to more privatisation, to review collective bargaining and industrial action and to make market reforms, including Sunday trading. Thursday morning's vote approved: Opponents of the bailout measures took to the streets of Athens in mainly peaceful protests ahead of the vote. One group threw petrol bombs at police officers who responded with tear gas. Unions and trade associations representing civil servants, municipal workers and pharmacy owners also went on strike on Wednesday.",
        "A toxic mix of higher inflation, stagnant wage growth and falling consumer confidence means that 2017 and 2018 could see that economy in dark and chilly waters, and not working for many people. The government will be expected to be ready with the lifeboats. Lifeboats which many believe are on the small side and possibly full of holes. Britain still has considerable debts, is running a deficit and has a productivity problem - meaning the economy is not producing sufficient economic wealth to increase general incomes. So far, the UK economy has performed robustly in the face of dire warnings that a vote to leave the European Union would lead to an immediate and negative impact on economic performance. Consumers have ignored the Cassandras standing at the shore, warning of shark-infested seas ahead, and have gone swimming anyway. Today saw the first evidence that one of those sharks - inflation - is starting to nibble at the bathers' toes. Inflation's rise to its highest level for two years can be directly linked to the value of sterling, which has fallen by 16 this year, mainly following the referendum. As the pound falls in value, import costs of staples like food and fuel rise. That starts feeding through to prices that consumers pay. Of course, inflation is still at historically low levels - and no one is predicting a 1970s-style spike. Meanwhile, a weaker pound encourages exports as it is cheaper to sell British products abroad. But many are arguing that where clothing and fuel prices go today - up compared to a year ago - food is likely to follow, cutting into people's already stretched finances. For the moment, supermarkets and their suppliers (remember the Marmite row?) are soaking up the larger part of higher import costs by reducing their profit margins. The cut-throat food market means that the run-up to Christmas - retailers' most important time - is not a time for widespread price increases. Some argue that this caution will not last much into the New Year. If inflation does maintain its upward trajectory, then the Bank of England will need to consider the path interest rates might take. Higher inflation is usually controlled by higher interest rates, but that reduces business and consumer spending power because the cost of borrowing money increases. Less spending in the economy tends to be deflationary. So if rates do rise, then that adds to the \"cost of living\" debate. A debate the prime minister knows will dominate her time in Downing Street.",
        "Dassey and his uncle Steven Avery were convicted of murdering a young woman, Teresa Halbach, in 2005. His conviction was overturned in 2016 on the basis his confession, made as a 16-year-old, was coerced. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Chicago, backed the ruling on Thursday. But the 27-year-old remains in jail, facing the possibility of a retrial. Lawyers have vowed to fight to free Dassey, whose case garnered international attention after featuring in the popular Netflix series. In a joint statement, lawyers said they were \"overjoyed,\" adding: \"We look forward to working to secure his release from prison as soon as possible. As of today's date, Brendan Dassey has lost 4,132 days of his life to prison.\" Making a Murderer investigated the killing of Ms Halbach, whose charred remains were found at Avery's car salvage yard a week after she went there to photograph a minivan for sale, and the subsequent court cases. Dassey, then just 16 years old, confessed to helping his uncle Avery - who had already served 18 years for a crime he did not commit - rape, kill and mutilate Ms Halbach. He was sentenced to life in prison. But the documentary filmmakers cast doubt on the legal process used to convict Dassey and Avery. In 2016, Judge William Duffin ordered he be free immediately after finding investigators in the 2007 trial made \"repeated false promises\" false promises to Dassey by assuring him \"he had nothing to worry about.\" When considered with \"Dassey's age, intellectual deficits, and the absence of a supportive adult,\" he considered the confession coerced. But Dassey remained in jail while prosecutors appealed the decision. In Chicago on Thursday, they lost that appeal. The court described the method used to get Dassey to confess as \"death by a thousand cuts,\" with judge David Hamilton saying the decision \"breaks new ground and poses troubling questions for police and prosecutors.\" The ruling means Dassey could be released in the next 90 days. However, Johnny Koremenos, a spokesman for Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, said it seemed likely they would appeal it once more. \"We anticipate seeking review by the entire Seventh Circuit or the United States Supreme Court and hope that today's erroneous decision will be reversed,\" he told new agency Reuters in an email.",
        "He said Mrs May must remember she is the PM of all parts of the UK. Lord Alderdice was speaking in the House of Lords as peers considered the government's Brexit bill. He was speaking in support of an amendment that insists that no hard border is put in place between NI and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. The amendment proposed by former Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Hain stated that an open border must continue in line with the provisions of the 1998 Belfast Agreement. After hearing government assurances during the debate, Lord Hain later withdrew his amendment. Lord Hain, who was Northern Ireland secretary of state from 2005 until 2007, said: \"If we get this wrong, for the UK, it may be perilous. For Northern Ireland it could be politically lethal.\" Lord Alderdice, a Liberal Democrat peer who voted Remain in last year's referendum, said that Mrs May must not view the issue of the border as if she was still home secretary. He added that it was his fear that the government was looking at this with \"the approach of the Home Office.\" He also called on Mrs May to approach the issue of the border with \"imagination\" and \"political creativity.\" In response, Lord Trimble, the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader who sits on the Conservative benches, rejected the amendment supported by Lord Alderdice and Lord Hain. Lord Trimble told peers he did not believe the amendment was necessary. He said: \"The amendment is asking the Prime Minster to support the maintenance of the open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \"The Prime Minister does that as of now. It is in the White Paper. It is not necessary.\" Former Conservative minister, Lord Howell, supported Lord Trimble's position on the amendment. Former UUP leader, Lord Empey, said the amendment was \"misplaced.\" He told his fellow peers that he agreed totally with \"an open free border.\" However, he called on the government to give an assurance that \"there will be no internal border in the UK.\" Baroness O'Loan told a packed chamber that she opposed the amendment. She said it would not \"benefit the UK\" and that the issue of the border should be \"dealt with in the negotiations.\" Lord Kilclooney, the former Ulster Unionist MP, also opposed the amendment and told the house that the \"southern Irish were petrified about Brexit.\" Earlier, Lord Hain said Brexit could cause \"profound damage\" to the peace process and warned that a return to checkpoints along the border would sew division and discontent. Responding for the government, Lord Dunlop said there was no need for Lord Hain's amendment. He said the \"government's intentions are clear\" and that no undertaking was \"necessary.\" The peer, who represents the Northern Ireland Office, added that maintaining the Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland \"will be a priority.\" He said the government is seeking \"practical solutions\" to achieve as \"frictionless a border as possible.\" At the end of the debate, Lord Hain withdrew his amendment. His move came as peers began the detailed committee stage debate on the European Union Notification of Withdrawal Bill. The legislation has already cleared the Commons without amendment.",

        "Conservative MP Damian Collins made the call after US media claims that former Fifa executive Chuck Blazer recorded conversations with football officials at the London 2012 Olympics. Russia will host the 2018 World Cup after England's unsuccessful bid. The 2022 World Cup will be in Qatar. The SFO can investigate \"cases which undermine UK commercialfinancial PLC in general and the City of London in particular\" and has been following bribery claims stemming from the December 2010 decision to award rights for the next two World Cups. Fifa has already undertaken its own investigation into the corruption allegations, led by independent ethics investigator Michael Garcia. American Blazer was a member of Fifa's executive committee from 1996 to 2013. On Sunday, the New York Daily News alleged US FBI agents recruited Blazer by threatening him with arrest and prosecution for tax fraud if he failed to cooperate. Media playback is not supported on this device The paper says Blazer was supplied with a modified keyring that contained a tiny microphone in order to secretly record conversations with leading football officials during a visit to the London 2012 Olympic Games. \"If there is evidence that Chuck Blazer held meetings during the Olympics, that would come under the jurisdiction of the SFO,\" Collins told BBC Sport. \"I want to see if they would now be prepared to act.\" Fifa declined to comment about Blazer when contacted. BBC Sport has seen a letter from the SFO to Collins, sent before the allegations about Blazer were published, which said the crime bureau was watching corruption allegations \"with interest.\" The letter added that the SFO did not believe it had the right to launch its own inquiry. SFO director David Green told Collins: \"The allegations that have occurred so far are against non-UK nationals and the alleged conduct took place outside of the UK.\" That could now change if reports of Blazer recording officials in London are accurate. Green's letter adds: \"I can.... assure you that the SFO will continue to keep the jurisdictional position under review.\" Collins wrote to the SFO in September asking it to seek access to the report produced by Michael Garcia. Garcia spent 18 months interviewing individuals from nations wanting to stage the 2018 and 2022 finals - and wants greater transparency from Fifa. But Fifa president Sepp Blatter said Garcia's full report will not be published because of legal issues. The information that will be eventually be revealed is now in the hands of Hans-Joachim Eckert, a German judge tasked by Fifa with deciding if any individuals breached the organisation's code of ethics. He is due to make an interim statement later this month, which may include redacted sections of Garcia's findings. Collins is concerned that information relating to claims made by former chairman of the FA Lord Triesman concerning alleged corruption could be contained within Garcia's files but will not be made public. Lord Triesman made a series of allegations concerning his time involved with England's 2018 bid in evidence to a House of Lords committee in 2011. Furthermore, Collins asked the SFO to consider whether evidence of any additional wrongdoing, which might fall under its jurisdiction, could be revealed by obtaining access to Garcia's report. In light of the SFO's response and Chuck Blazer's alleged role as an FBI informant, Collins believes Fifa must now publish Garcia's findings and inform the relevant law enforcement agencies. \"If Fifa is sitting on evidence relating to acts of bribery and corruption, then it is more than just a football matter,\" Collins said. \"It is unthinkable they wouldn't reveal what they have. \"There are people who are stopping evidence being made available. You'll have to draw your own conclusions as to why that is.\"",
        "But there is a mismatch between those soothing words and the aggressive trade policies laid out during the campaign - which included harsh tariffs on China and tearing up existing agreements. It is hard to know if Mr Trump will follow up on his threats, but they have a combustive potential. And trade is one area where the president has freedom to act without the approval of lawmakers in Congress. Five questions on economy for Trump UK businesses react to Trump's win Trump's economic promises President Trump: All hat, now where are the cattle? So what did we learn during the campaign about Mr Trump's views on trade? Well, you can find a summary of his policies on his campaign website, but here's a quick tour. Perhaps his most radical idea is to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese-made goods, if China does not reform its trade relations with the US. Mr Trump has floated the idea of a swingeing 45 tariff on Chinese imports. In a big economic policy speech in June he told workers at a metal processing plant that China had \"cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficit and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.\" During that speech he reminded workers that President Reagan had imposed tariffs of 45 on Japanese motorcycles and 100 on computer chips. If Mr Trump's threat crystallised it would supply a shock to the US economy as China is an important supplier of many goods. Take mobile devices for example. China supplies three-quarters of the phones imported into the US and it supplies almost all laptop and tablet computers. Mr Trump has also been scathing about the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Introduced in 1994 it greatly reduced, and in some cases eliminated altogether, tariffs for trade between the US and its two immediate neighbours, Mexico and Canada. \"Nafta was the worst trade deal in the history of this country,\" Mr Trump said in June. He blames the deal for the loss of thousands of US manufacturing jobs and wants to reverse that by renegotiating the terms of the deal. If Mexico and Canada do not agree to the new terms, Mr Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement altogether. In February, after five years of work, the US and 11 other nations signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the biggest multinational trade deals ever. That agreement now looks dead as Mr Trump has called it a \"horrible deal\" and said that he would block it. The deal involves 12 nations from around the Pacific Rim, and was partly designed to counter the growing economic power of China. However, Mr Trump claims that trade with those nations had already cost the US two million jobs - with the manufacturing of cars and car parts particularly suffering. A lot of work has also gone into a new trade deal between the US and the European Union. Since 2013 the two sides have been negotiating the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP, aimed at removing or reducing trade barriers. That deal has faced opposition in Europe and now, with a US administration that is sceptical over trade deals, looks even less likely to reach fruition. An existing deal under threat is the 2011 free trade agreement with South Korea. According to figures quoted on Mr Trump's campaign website, the deal has cost 100,000 jobs and has not resulted in any increase in US exports to South Korea. While many nations might have their trade deals torn up, the UK might well be looked on favourably by the Trump administration. The president-elect was a supporter of the UK leaving the European Union and last month his trade adviser Dan DiMicco told the BBC that negotiating a new trade deal with the UK would be \"one of the first things\" that his trade officials would do. Mr DiMicco also said that Mr Trump was serious about his threats over trade: \"Things have gotten so bad that we will leave Nafta, WTO [the World Trade Organization] and the Korean Free Trade Agreement if we can't get a fair deal. \"These are not idle threats.\" But the WTO has congratulated Mr Trump on his victory and appeared to acknowledge his concerns over jobs. The WTO is \"ready to support the administration to ensure trade is a positive element in a new strategy for development job creation,\" tweeted director-general Roberto Azevedo. \"It's clear many feel trade isn't working for them. We must address this and ensure trade delivers the widest benefit to the most people,\" he added.",
        "It is believed to be the first time teachers would have been given a special legal protection in this way. Education minister Esteban Bullrich's plan would add a 25 higher penalty if an offence was against a teacher. Mr Bullrich said it would make sure the public showed them more \"respect.\" If the law is adopted by Argentina's congress it would mean any attack against a teacher would become an aggravated offence with increased penalties. It would apply to parents and students and would include verbal abuse or threats as well as physical violence. An offender attacking a teacher would receive a 25 longer prison sentence or pay a 25 bigger fine than if a similar offence had been committed against anyone else. The plan, developed by the education minister and Argentina's president, Mauricio Macri, is a way of supporting their government's \"education revolution.\" \"We knew we needed to raise the image of teachers in our society. Slowly, but steadily, their image had fallen,\" Mr Bullrich told the BBC. \"There were increased cases of disrespect from parents and students and even aggression towards teachers. \"That's when the idea of distinguishing teachers in our penal code came up. If you hit or shout at a teacher, then you are doing so towards the most important member in our society. \"Without teachers we would not have ministers or presidents, we would not have the world today. Let us grant them that respect and distinguished treatment.\" More stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch John Bangs of Education International, an international federation of teachers' unions, supported the signal sent by the idea of tougher penalties for assaults on teachers. Schools are fundamental to their communities. If teachers are in fear, it means that children are in fear. Nothing could be more corrosive to confidence and learning. \"Argentina's action might appear to be a simplistic response to complex problem, but it gives a powerful message that violence against a teacher is not only an individual assault but an assault on education.\" Argentina's education system, which has performed poorly in international tests, has faced waves of industrial unrest, and Mr Bullrich has campaigned to gain the support of teachers for education reform. As minister for education in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires, he published his personal mobile phone number so that teachers could ring him directly with their problems. The minister said teachers thought no-one in government was listening to them and that was contributing to low morale and disaffection. Mr Bullrich gave out his mobile number for \"questions, comments and complaints,\" in a bid to tackle teachers' practical worries such as errors with pay and allowances or problems with school buildings. \"People didn't really know if it was true that I would answer,\" said Mr Bullrich when he launched the scheme. \"This guy rang at 02:00 and really blasted me on the phone You owe me money.' So I called him back at 02.15 and said,'Hello this is the minister of education.' First there was silence on the line and then we got the information and we solved the problem.\" The number of teachers' strikes fell sharply in Buenos Aires. Now Mr Bullrich is the national education minister and he has continued offering his mobile phone number - and he says that he receives hundreds of phone calls each day. In England, teachers' unions have made repeated warnings about attacks on school staff. The ATL teachers' union recently published a survey claiming four out of 10 teachers had experienced violence in the past year. This included being hit, kicked or having objects thrown at them. There have been international efforts to formally give schools and teachers a protected status during wars and conflicts. It followed concerns that places of education were being attacked, whether accidentally or deliberately, and they did not have the same protection that was accorded to hospitals or medical staff in warzones. A Safe Schools Declaration has been signed by more than 50 countries, committing them to protect schools and their staff.",

        "But more than 400 years on, it has become a sticking point in the Stormont talks. In response to demands for an Irish language act, the Democratic Unionist party is understood to want more formal protection for Ulster-Scots too. But what form would that take and what do Ulster-Scots speakers want? According to the 2011 census, 8 of Northern Ireland's population claim some knowledge of Ulster-Scots - just over 140,000 people. That included 13 of Protestants and 3 of Catholics. By contrast, more than 179,000 people claimed to have some knowledge of Irish. The former Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure published proposals for an Irish language act in 2015. However, in the same year the department published a strategy to enhance and develop the Ulster-Scots language, heritage and culture up until the year 2035. Although a strategy is not legislation, that document gives some pointers about what form any enhanced status for Ulster-Scots may mean. It included these proposals: Those were all important for Ulster-Scots enthusiasts at the Ullans centre in Ballymoney, County Antrim - a hub for the Ulster-Scots language, music, dance and history. But more money is also a big issue, according to Louise Morrow who teaches classes in Ulster-Scots. \"Equality of funding is a big thing for me,\" she said. \"The Irish language does get more funding and is more recognised than the Ulster-Scots language. \"We would also like to see more Ulster-Scots townland names being recognised. \"Ulster-Scots is forgotten about in some ways I feel.\" For fellow volunteer Johnny Crawford, more education is vital. \"We'd like to see more provision in schools and more curriculum-based Ulster-Scots,\" he said. \"It's also mostly primary school driven, as there isn't a lot of resources for post-primary pupils.\" The Ullans centre is also home to Northern Ireland's only dedicated Ulster-Scots radio station, Fuse FM. One of its presenters, Liam Logan, says any legislation or strategy to protect and promote Ulster-Scots can be introduced gradually. \"At the bottom of it is that notion of education, so people have an idea of their Ulster-Scots linguistic heritage,\" he said. \"And a wee bit of respect that says just because you speak in an Ulster-Scots way, it doesn't mean you're stupid.\" So while the talking goes on at Stormont - and like their counterparts who speak Irish - Ulster-Scots enthusiasts say they want action and not just words. And according to fluent Ulster-Scots speaker Jack Kyle, from Ballymoney, the stakes are high. \"I was born here, my father was born here and my mum and my grandparents,\" he said. \"People around here still speak Ulster-Scots like they did. \"We just don't want to see it dying out.\"",

        "Jackie Powell was arrested last year on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of Brady's victim Keith Bennett. The Crown Prosecution Service said no action would be taken against Ms Powell, of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire. Brady is being held at high security Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside. Brady, now 74, and Myra Hindley murdered five children between 1963 and 1965 in Greater Manchester. Keith Bennett is the only one of their victims never to be found. Ms Powell was arrested after she told a television documentary Brady had given her a sealed envelope to pass to Winnie Johnson, Keith's mother, in the event of Brady's death. The letter was never found and Mrs Johnson died last August still not knowing where her son was buried. John Dilworth, head of the CPS North West Complex Case Unit, said: \"After careful consideration, we have decided that Ms Powell should not be charged, as it cannot be established that she knew the contents of the letter referred to, that the letter in question existed or what information it might have contained. \"The only evidence of the letter's existence was in comments given by Ms Powell to an interviewer and she stated only that she believed it may contain information about Keith Bennett. \"Even if it could be proved that this letter existed, there is insufficient evidence to prove that she genuinely believed it contained the information in question.\" Mr Dilworth said the CPS had written to Keith Bennett's brother to explain the decision and have offered a meeting to discuss it. Martin Bottomley, head of investigative review in Greater Manchester Police's major and cold case crime unit, said: \"As soon as we were made aware of the existence of this alleged letter, we made exhaustive attempts to obtain it to establish whether or not its contents would assist us in finding Keith's body. \"That resulted in the warrants we carried out in the South Wales area and at Ashworth Hospital in August 2012. \"However, despite seizing numerous documents and a search of Brady's cell, no such letter has been recovered.\" He said the letter may have been destroyed, hidden elsewhere, or it may have been handed to someone else. \"It may simply never have existed in the first place and this has been yet more mind games by Brady,\" he said. He added: \"Keith still has surviving relatives who deserve to know the truth and Greater Manchester Police will continue to act on any credible evidence to bring this torment to an end.\"",
        "This is despite the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group (AWMSG) advising the Welsh Government not to fund Prep on cost-effectiveness grounds. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething has announced that during the research period \"those for whom the drug is clinically appropriate can access it.\" The trial will begin this summer. An independent HIV expert group had already called the drug, which has got the go-ahead in Scotland, \"highly effective\" when used with the right groups and in the right doses. AWMSG had said there were \"several uncertainties and limitations\" in the economic model provided by the drug company. The Terrence Higgins Trust in Wales had called the AWMSG recommendation earlier this week \"short-sighted,\" saying Prep could save the NHS money in the long term. Mr Gething said there was no doubt that Prep - or Truvada - reduced rates of HIV infection when taken correctly and supported by wider, preventative sexual health services. \"The study will help us to learn how best to provide the preventative treatment to reduce risks of HIV transmission in Wales and answer some of the questions raised by the AWMSG around incidence rates,\" he said. \"The AWMSG is a highly regarded, independent expert group. I acknowledge their advice that there are uncertainties regarding cost-effectiveness and that they have not recommended the drug for routine use within NHS Wales at this time.\" Around 150 new people are diagnosed with HIV in Wales each year, nearly half from sexually transmitted infection between men. A daily dose of the pill is suggested for people at high risk who might not have safe sex. One estimate is it might cost PS2.5m a year in Wales. It is currently used in the US, Canada, Australia and France, and taken daily, it has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by 86. Stonewall Cymru, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans equality charity, has been campaigning for Prep to be made available on the NHS. The charity's Wales director, Andrew White said: \"This trial will allow Wales to protect those most at risk and given that it costs much more to treat than to prevent HIV, in the long-term this will also save NHS Wales money.\" \"Of course, Prep is not the sole answer to tackling HIV transmission. This preventative measure should be accompanied by high-quality sex and relationships education,\" he added. Stonewall Cymru said it will now press the Welsh Government to make the drug available in the longer term. It is not the first time a Welsh health minister has gone against advice over the cost of a drug. Four years ago, then Health Minister Mark Drakeford approved the use of cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco which was estimated at costing NHS Wales up to PS180,000 per patient per year. Neath AM Jeremy Miles, patron of LGBT Labour Wales, said: \"We must take all appropriate action against preventable HIV transmission and the Welsh Government is listening to clinical experts who know the positive impact Prep could have alongside other measures to encourage safer sex.\"",

        "The body of Kimberley Jones, 25, was found by a paramedic at the house in Cwmbach, Aberdare, on 9 August, 2013. Mother-of-one Ms Jones was due to move into the house the following day, but was allowed to stay the night before. Tests on the fire showed the flue was ineffective allowing smoke to leak into the room, the Aberdare inquest heard. During those tests carbon monoxide gas was at 16 times the acceptable level. Ms Jones' father, Andrew Jones, told the inquest he knew the owner of the house, Ms Linda Parfitt, as a family friend for 25 years and he arranged to buy the house from her to use as a home for his daughter. Ms Parfitt left the property at the start of the week and Mr Jones was decorating it that week. He said he stayed there for two nights to keep the house secure. His daughter, who worked as a care worker, was due to stay there on Thursday 8 August, but Mr Jones said he had woken up cold the previous morning so decided to light the fire. He told the inquest that he told his daughter to keep a window open as he did not want her to die from carbon monoxide poisoning. He said: \"That will haunt me for the rest of my days.\" Mr Jones said his wife called him the following morning as she could not contact their daughter. He said he went to the house but the emergency services were already there. He told the coroner he identified his daughter's body later that day. Plumbing inspector Howard Reed told the coroner the fire was dirty with a lot of soot and debris. Tests showed its window and door leaked smoke and carbon monoxide tests found that after two hours there were 829 parts per million (ppm) of the gas in the room. A domestic carbon monoxide alarm would sound at about 50 ppm and levels of between 600 and 750ppm are likely to cause fatalities, the hearing was told. Debris on the fire's throat plate, which is used to restrict airflow, was blocking the flue and Mr Reed estimated it had not been removed for \"many years.\" The owner of the house at the time, Ms Parfitt, told the inquest that she and her ex-partner arranged for the fire to be installed. Ms Parfitt told the inquest that a vent in the living room had been there prior to moving into the house. She said that she did not inspect it and could not explain how a magazine cover found its way into the grill opening. When shown a picture of smoke coming from the fire during the inspection after Ms Jones died, Miss Parfitt told the coroner: \"I've never seen smoke coming out of it like that - I'm sure about that.\" The inquest has now been adjourned until later in the year.",
        "Julie Sayles, 59, of Sewerby Road, Bridlington is alleged to have persuaded Edith Negus to change her will to benefit her. She also bought two houses with money she allegedly took from a joint bank account she shared with Mrs Negus. Ms Sayles, who worked for an elderly-care charity, denies fraud charges. More on this and other East Yorkshire stories At Hull Crown Court Ms Sayles described herself \"as a woman of faith.\" She said she became close to Mrs Negus after she started taking her for days out and church visits and said Mrs Negus was not getting any support from her family. Ms Sayles said Mrs Negus had known exactly what she wanted to do with her money and that she \"had repeatedly said that she wanted me to have that money.\" Prosecutor Robert Stevenson accused Ms Sayles of \"being a liar\" and said she was taking advantage of the fact Mrs Negus was no longer here. Mr Stevenson then asked Ms Sayles why she did not inform Mrs Negus's family about the will change. He said that if she had contacted the family \"her game would've been up.\" Ms Sayles denied the accusation and said that the family had the opportunity to discuss it with Ms Negus and contacting them would have meant she would \"have lost her friendship with Edith.\" Ms Sayles is accused of fraud by abuse of position, buying properties with the proceeds of crime, making a fraudulent will and presenting it to a solicitor. The trial continues.",
        "Zhou Youguang helped invent Pinyin, a writing system that turns Chinese characters into words using letters from the Roman alphabet. This makes it easier to learn how to pronounce Chinese words, and is credited with helping raise literacy rates in China. Despite his achievements, Mr Zhou remains largely unknown in his home country. Perhaps that is because the 106-year-old is a defiant character, refusing to take much credit for his work or pander to the Chinese Communist Party. He is critical of the party that governs China - and old enough not to care who is listening to what he has to say. \"What are they going to do, come and take me away?\" he said in an interview with the BBC in his sparsely furnished Beijing home. Positive outlook Mr Zhou's life has coincided with most of the momentous events of China's recent history, as it has moved from imperial dynasty to peoples' republic to capitalist powerhouse. He was born in 1906 into a wealthy family that managed to lose its money three times: first in the Qing dynasty, then during World War II and finally during the Cultural Revolution, a political campaign launched by Mao Zedong. Nevertheless, he managed to get a good education, studying economics at St John's University, one of the best educational institutions in Shanghai in the 1920s when he was there. Several years of his early life were spent working in the US for a Chinese bank. \"It was at No 1 Wall Street - the centre of imperialism,\" he said, laughing. Mr Zhou laughs a lot, a result of an optimistic outlook. \"There are good aspects to even bad things,\" he said. That does not mean everything in the centenarian's life has gone his way. His daughter died of appendicitis just before her sixth birthday and, like many intellectuals, he was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. A common form of punishment at the time - in the late 1960s - was to send educated city professionals to the countryside to \"learn from the masses.\" Mr Zhou spent several years working in the fields of Ningxia, a poor region in western China. \"It was a waste of time and stopped me doing other things,\" he said, unable to stop himself laughing again. Despite hardships, Mr Zhou did have one enormous stroke of luck. When the Communist Party took over in China in 1949, he was in the US. He decided to return, along with many others, to build a new country. He initially become an economics professor at Shanghai's Fudan University, but in 1955 was invited to join a committee in Beijing looking at simplifying the Chinese language. At first he resisted, saying he had no professional experience in this field. He was finally persuaded to join the project by a friend. It was a decision that probably saved his life. A few years later, Chairman Mao launched one of his first purges, and many of those caught in the mayhem were those who had gone back to China from abroad. \"All university professors who'd returned from the US were labelled'Rightists'. Many committed suicide, including some good friends. I luckily missed it,\" he said. It was one of the few moments that Mr Zhou did not laugh. Dark future? The work he did on the committee not only saved him, it allowed him to make a major contribution to the Chinese language. When he started work on developing Pinyin, 85 of Chinese people could not read or write. Now, that is just a few percent. There had been previous attempts to Romanise Chinese characters, but the system developed by Mr Zhou and his colleagues is the one that most people now use, and is recognised internationally. \"We spent three years developing pinyin. People made fun of us, joking that it had taken us a long time to deal with just 26 letters,\" he said. Having lived so long and done such high-profile work, the linguist has met more than his fair share of historical characters. One of his favourite stories is about Puyi, China's last emperor, who became an ordinary citizen under Chairman Mao. Mr Zhou once belonged to a Chinese body that advises the government, work that allowed him to dine at the organisation's canteen in Beijing. During one of the country's periodic food shortages, he ate there daily, taking his wife along too. This meant more food at home for Mr Zhou's relatives. \"Everyday when I went to eat, there was an old man sitting next to me. He was also there with his wife,\" he said. \"It was Puyi - the last emperor. Imagine, even the emperor had to eat there because he didn't have enough food.\" Mr Zhou's age has also given him a long view of history. He believes the Chinese Communist Party will not always rule the country. \"China will have to release itself from communism. The future will be dark if it doesn't,\" said Mr Zhou, who retired at 85, but is still writing books. It is a damning comment from a man who came back to China because he believed the Communist Party when its leaders said they were democratic. Does he ever regret that decision? \"We believed Mao's words. We didn't know that when he got into power he would become the worst kind of dictator,\" said Mr Zhou. \"But I don't regret coming back - there's no point,\" he added, laughing again.",
        "The man, in his 30s, was found just after 05:00 on Wednesday lying on the ground between Talisman Rise and Templar Rise in Dedridge, Livingston. He had sustained a \"significant\" head injury and was taken by ambulance to St John's Hospital in Livingston. Police Scotland said the man remains in a stable condition. DC Iain Duncan, of Police Scotland, said: \"At this stage of inquiry we do not know what has happened to this man and we are now working to ascertain the full set of circumstances. \"Today, I urge anyone who was in the area between midnight and 6am on Wednesday and who has information relevant to our investigation to please come forward immediately.\"",
        "Most incidents came during the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union battled for influence across the continent. CIA covert operations are by their very nature hard to prove definitively. But research into the agency's work, as well as revelations by former CIA employees, has thrown up several cases where the agency tried to influence events. Here are four examples: Patrice Lumumba became the first prime minister of the newly-independent Congo in 1960, but he lasted just a few months in the job before he was overthrown and assassinated in January 1961. In 2002, former colonial power Belgium admitted responsibility for its part in the killing, however, the US has never explained its role despite long-held suspicions. US President Dwight D Eisenhower, concerned about communism, was worried about Congo following a similar path to Cuba. According to a source quoted in Death in the Congo, a book about the assassination, President Eisenhower gave \"an order for the assassination of Lumumba. There was no discussion; the [National Security Council] meeting simply moved on.\" However, a CIA plan to lace Lumumba's toothpaste with poison was never carried out, Lawrence Devlin, who was a station chief in Congo at the time, told the BBC in 2000. A survey of declassified US government documents from the era notes that the CIA \"initially focussed on removing Lumumba, not only through assassination if necessary but also with an array of non-lethal undertakings.\" While there is no doubt the CIA wanted him dead, the survey does not indicate direct US involvement in his eventual killing. Ghana's first President Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown in a military coup in 1966 while he was out of the country. He later suspected that the US had a role in his downfall and in a 1978 book, former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell backed this theory up. In In Search of Enemies he writes that an official sanction for the coup does not appear in CIA documents, but he writes \"the Accra station was nevertheless encouraged by headquarters to maintain contact with dissidents. \"It was given a generous budget, and maintained intimate contact with the plotters as a coup was hatched.\" He says that the CIA in Ghana got more involved and its operatives were given \"unofficial credit for the eventual coup.\" A declassified US government document does show awareness of a plot to overthrow the president, but does not indicate any official backing. Another declassified document written after the coup describes Nkrumah's fall as a \"fortuitous windfall. Nkrumah was doing more to undermine our interests than any other black African.\" In Angola three competing groups fought for control after independence from Portugal in 1975, with the MPLA under Agostinho Neto taking over the capital Luanda. Mr Stockwell, chief of CIA's covert operations in Angola in 1975, writes that Washington decided to oppose the MPLA, as it was seen as closer to the Soviet Union, and support the FNLA and Unita instead, even though all three had help from communist countries. The CIA then helped secretly import weapons, including 30,000 rifles, through Kinshasa in neighbouring Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr Stockwell says in a video documentary. He adds that CIA officers also trained fighters for armed combat. A declassified US government document detailing a discussion between the head of the CIA, the secretary of state and others indicates the support the CIA gave to the forces fighting the MPLA. The US continued to support Unita through much of the civil war as Cuba was backing the MPLA. Hissene Habre failed in his attempt to take power by force in Chad in 1980. But his efforts led President Goukouni Oueddei to call on help from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose soldiers successfully beat back Habre's challenge and forced him into exile. A proposed alliance between Libya and Chad began to unsettle the US especially as Gaddafi began to be seen as a supporter of anti-US activities. In Foreign Policy magazine Michael Bronner writes that the CIA director, with the secretary of state, \"coalesced around the idea of launching a covert war in partnership with Habre.\" It is alleged that the US then backed Habre's overthrow of the president in 1982 and then supported him throughout his brutal rule.",
        "Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton told the BBC's Andrew Marr that refusing to launch nuclear weapons would \"seriously undermine\" Britain's \"deterrent.\" And he said he would be worried if such a view \"translated into power.\" Mr Corbyn called on the defence secretary to \"take action\" against Sir Nicholas over his comments. In a statement, the Labour leader said: \"It is a matter of serious concern that the chief of the defence staff has today intervened directly in issues of political dispute. \"It is essential in a democracy that the military remains politically neutral at all times. \"By publicly taking sides in current political arguments, Sir Nicholas Houghton has clearly breached that constitutional principle. Accordingly, I am writing to the defence secretary to ask him to take action to ensure that the neutrality of the armed forces is upheld.\" Mr Corbyn, a leading member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, sparked a row with his shadow cabinet at his party's annual conference when he revealed that would never press the \"nuclear button\" - and he has since praised Scottish Labour's rejection of Trident. Mr Corbyn has said he was elected Labour leader on a platform of opposing Trident renewal and that he is committed to \"promoting an international nuclear weapons convention which would lead to a nuclear-free world.\" Asked about Mr Corbyn's refusal to use nuclear weapons, Sir Nicholas said: \"It would worry me if that thought was translated into power as it were.\" He added: \"The whole thing about deterrence rests on the credibility of its use. \"When people say you're never going to use the deterrent, what I say is you use the deterrent every second of every minute of every day and the purpose of the deterrent is that you don't have to use it because you successfully deter. \"If a prime minister said they would never press the nuclear button, \"the deterrent is then completely undermined,\" he added. \"Most of the politicians I know understand that and I think that, dare I say, the responsibility of power is probably quite a sobering thing and you come to a realisation,'I understand how this thing works'.\" Attending a wreath-laying ceremony in his Islington North constituency following the Remembrance Sunday commemorations at the Cenotaph, Mr Corbyn said Sir Nicholas's comments had been \"unhelpful.\" \"I would gently say to him, with the greatest of respect, we live in a democracy where politicians are elected to Parliament in order to take political decisions,\" he told Channel 4 News. \"If he's worried, I think he should talk to me about it. I don't think it is appropriate for serving officers to make political comments or engage in political debate.\" Shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle told Andrew Marr she was leading an \"open-minded\" review of the policy in light of Mr Corbyn's views and a vote by Scottish Labour against the renewal of Trident. She said she had yet to meet Mr Corbyn to discuss Trident but a date was in her diary. But she appeared to back Sir Nicholas, telling Andrew Marr: \"I understand the point that he is making. It is the point that I made myself when Jeremy said what he said.\" She defended the right of Britain's most senior military figure to speak out on such a politically sensitive issue. \"I don't think there is anything wrong with him expressing himself in those terms,\" she said. She indicated she could resign if there was any change to the party's current position in favour of renewing the Trident submarine fleet. \"I am not a unilateral nuclear disarmer. I don't believe that that works. \"I think I would find it difficult [to continue in the shadow cabinet] but we are not there yet. We have got a big process to go through,\" she said.",
        "Leader Grenville Ham said community-run renewable energy schemes and \"truly efficient\" housing could provide jobs for thousands of people. \"Across Wales, Greens have the expertise and the appetite to develop sustainable local economies that provide jobs for all,\" he said. The party currently has one Welsh councillor and 50 confirmed candidates. \"As a party, we are focusing on reducing fuel bills through local selling of locally-generated renewable energy,\" Mr Ham said. \"My vision is to cut out the exploitative middle man in energy production and delivery, through Green-led local action.\" Mr Ham added that Green councillors would not be told by party bosses how to vote on issues. \"We believe that our candidates know their local community best,\" he said.",
        "The raids came a day after it emerged a Frenchman was being held by police investigating the murder of three people at the Brussels Jewish Museum. Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, was arrested at a station in Marseille on Friday. Prosecutors say he has claimed responsibility for the attack and spent more than a year in Syria. Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve told Europe 1 radio on Monday: \"There are people who recruit jihadists. There are as I'm speaking arrests being made.\" \"We are acting everywhere. There will be no respite in the fight against terrorists.\" There is no suggestion of a link between the four arrests on Monday and the detention of Mr Nemmouche during a random check on a coach arriving from Amsterdam in southern France on Friday. But Mr Nemmouche is said to have had links with radical Islamists and served five years in jail in France for robbery before being released in December 2012. When he was arrested, he had with him a Kalashnikov rifle and a handgun believed to have been used in the attack, the Paris prosecutor said. He was also said to have had a white sheet emblazoned with the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, a jihadist group fighting in Syria, and a camera with a 40-second video showing the two guns and a voice recording, claiming responsibility for the killings. Speaking on French radio station RTL on Monday, the head of French Jewish association CRIF, Roger Cukierman, called for more resources to be given to the foreign intelligence service, the DGSE, to track militants returning to France from Syria. He feared \"they would become 700 time bombs when they return,\" referring to the estimated number of French-born jihadists in Syria. Belgium has requested Mr Nemmouche's extradition from France and police have to decide whether to extend his detention until Thursday. Three people died when a gunman opened fire at the museum in the busy Sablon area of the Belgian capital on 24 May. They were an Israeli couple in their 50s, and a French female volunteer. A Belgian man, believed to be an employee of the museum, was critically injured.",
        "Trott hit 175 as Warwickshire totalled 413 at Taunton, backed by half-centuries from Tim Ambrose (63) and Rikki Clarke (57). Young paceman Grant Thornton then took two of the four Somerset wickets to fall on his Championship debut. But Marcus Trescothick was still there at the close on 41, out of 94-4. After two badly rain-interrupted days. the draw remains the most likely result. But the Bears, so badly beaten by an innings in their opening two matches, have at least given themselves a chance of forcing victory, although it would take 16 wickets in the day to do it - and getting Trescothick out twice. Bottom club Somerset's target on day four will simply be to avoid the follow-on - and they need a further 170 to do that. Somerset's Marcus Trescothick told BBC Radio Bristol: \"One of the office staff told me around 10 days ago how close I was to 25,000 runs and I have been sweating on it since then. \"I knew when I went in that I was 29 away. It got a bit tense as I moved closer. \"It is an achievement I am proud of but there is still a big job for me to do in this game. \"It wasn't a great day for us and we need to concentrate hard tomorrow to make sure we come away with a draw.\" Warwickshire's Jonathan Trott told BBC Coventry Warwickshire: \"It's great that Marcus is still playing county cricket and setting an example to the young players in his dressing room and opposition teams. \"There is no chance I will be still be playing at 41. That's just silly! His will be a huge wicket for us tomorrow. \"I had just got past 100 when the new ball was taken so it was important I hung around for longer if we were to get a decent score. I started to think in terms of 400 when Rikki Clarke came in and played so well. \"There is a bit of turn because it is a used pitch. With so much rain, the crustiness has taken longer to form, but hopefully Jeetan Patel can cause them a few problems.\"",
        "Konta beat world number 60 Kristyna Pliskova of the Czech Republic 6-4 6-7 (11-13) 6-3. Her next opponent will be another Czech, Katerina Siniakova, who beat Serbian Nina Stojanovic 6-3 6-4. Siniakova caused a surprise in the second round by defeating second seed Simona Halep. Konta looked in control early on against her opponent - the twin sister of world number six Karolina Pliskova - as she took the first set with a single break of serve. Neither player could force a break point in the second set and in the resulting tie-break Konta wasted two match points before the big-serving Pliskova levelled the match on her fifth set point. But Konta stayed firm in the final set, claiming the break and reaching the semi-final on her fifth match point. \"I am very happy to have extended my stay here,\" she said. \"She is one of the best servers on tour so I knew I was going to have a hard time on her service games. I was very happy I was able to get that break in the third and see it out in the end.\"",
        "In a statement to its members, the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC) said it has \"decided to shelve discussions about a sale\" of Silverstone Circuit. Potential investors including the Jaguar Land Rover group and MotorSport Vision had previously shown interest in the Northamptonshire venue. The statement added the move is \"not without risk.\" Former British F1 driver Jonathan Palmer's MotorSport Vision pulled out of the running for the circuit before Christmas. In November, Jaguar Land Rover said it had ended discussions with the BRDC \"for the foreseeable future.\" BRDC chairman John Grant said it had expected to \"pick up discussions\" with an \"unnamed substantial overseas investor\" in the new year, but added: \"After further reflection and, in particular, completion of the sale of Formula 1 to Liberty Media, the board has now decided to shelve discussions about a sale and continue on a go-it-alone basis.\" He said: \"While this is not without risk, we feel sufficient confidence in the improved prospects for our business to justify this change of direction.\" Mr Grant also said the decision means background changes such as the removal of the club secretary role and the introduction of a new voluntary club ambassador would now be put in place. These had been on hold while the talks were on-going. Further details will be discussed at the BRDC's AGM, due to take place in April.",
        "Exam regulator Ofqual says there were more than 572,000 queries over grades - an increase of 27. Head teachers have complained about the quality of marking and the damaging impact of incorrect grades. Ofqual is launching a consultation to overhaul the appeals system. The annual figures from Ofqual show another significant increase in exam papers sent back for being re-marking and grades changed at both A-level and GCSE in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Appeals against results meant that 62,000 grades were changed at GCSE and 28,500 at A-level. The number of grades changed after re-marking has almost doubled in three years. In 99 of cases, it was an upwards change. Brian Lightman, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said these exam results are of \"critical importance to the future of young people.\" \"We have warned for some time that the marking system is under huge pressure and fear that the increase in re-grades strongly suggests it is creaking under the strain.\" \"Every child sitting an exam deserves to trust that their paper will be marked accurately. So it is very disappointing to see yet another huge upsurge in false GCSE and A level grades,\" said Chris King, chair of the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference group of independent schools. \"The implications for pupils are grave - for some it has meant they have wrongly missed out on a place at their preferred sixth form, further education college or university of choice.\" But Mr King said the \"true statistics are likely to be even higher, as we know many state schools do not have the time and resources to put in lengthy, complicated and expensive appeals.\" There have been warnings from head teachers' leaders that because of the cost of re-marking, fewer appeals are likely from state schools. Figures from the OCR exam board published by the BBC earlier this year showed that independent school exam centres accounted for a disproportionate number of inquiries. But the analysis from Ofqual does not provide an official breakdown of state and independent school challenges to grades - or how much the process costs schools and parents. Exam boards refund the re-marking fee if an exam is changed - but not if the grade remains the same, with fees costing between about PS20 and PS60 per paper. This year's figures show more than 480,000 grades were not changed, representing millions of pounds of expense. The most common result challenged at GCSE was a D grade - reflecting the importance of getting across the C grade threshold. At A-level, the most challenges were for B grades, suggesting it could relate to university applications. Figures published on Thursday also showed that 2,460 exam candidates faced penalties for cheating this year, fewer than last year. But penalties for teachers caught cheating, such as giving unfair help to pupils in exams, more than doubled to 262. The Joint Council for Qualifications, representing exam boards, said only a small proportion of exam grades had been found to need changing, in a system with 50,000 markers and 15 million individual scripts. \"As data published today by Ofqual shows, each year over 8 million GCSE and A level grades are awarded to a high level of accuracy. Although the number of enquiries about results increased in 2015, the proportion of all grades changed was 1.1,\" said the JCQ's director general Michael Turner. Ofqual has launched a consultation into ways of improving the process of querying results. It will address concerns such as a \"lack of transparency in the system,\" the time taken to process appeals and the cost to schools and candidates. The proposals include marks only being changed if an examiner has made an error in applying the marking scheme, or adding up the marks. This would mean that if there was a difference in academic judgement between the original marker and a second examiner carrying out a re-mark, the original mark would stand. Ofqual chief Glenys Stacey said: \"This year we have seen another increase in appeals. \"Schools want to do the best for their students, which is understandable given the importance of GCSE, AS and A-level grades on their future prospects, but it also reflects teachers' increasing lack of confidence in marking and the current appeals system. We believe the evidence-based proposals put forward today will improve transparency and fairness.\"",
        "Former Celtic and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner assesses the victors' performance in Sunday's Scottish League Cup final, while former Aberdeen and Scotland defender Willie Miller gives his marks out of 10 for Derek McInnes' side. Didn't do too much wrong, couldn't do anything about the goals. Not over-worked, but Celtic had a number of other chances. Not the worst. In second-half, he came more to life in terms of getting forward, which is a big part of his game. In team for his height and domination but didn't dominate his opponent or take responsibility for closing gap between defence and midfield. Use of the ball was poor. Probably his poorest performance for Aberdeen - uncertain, played too deep. He didn't close down James Forrest quickly enough for the second goal and conceded the penalty for the third. Must be disappointed, because he's looked good since coming to the club Wasn't exposed on too many occasions against Patrick Roberts. Did have the chance with a header and maybe should have done better with it. Moved to centre-back later, his preferred his position. Didn't play to the standard he's capable of. Not the worst in midfield. Tried hard but played in an area that was dominated by Celtic. Only got close to Celtic's midfielders on a couple of occasions and should have made it more difficult for them. An opportunity as captain to lift the trophy. He normally gives you an element of control in midfield but didn't do that. The gap between him and his defence was too wide, allowing Roberts, Rogic and Forrest to get in behind. Largely anonymous in the first-half. Spent his time worrying about defensive duties rather than what he's good at. Turned it around in second half and had a number of good runs, but he's a match winner and he didn't show what he was capable of. Celtic dominated in midfield and McLean must take responsibility. He's been at the club long enough to know what's expected, should be performing to a high level and on the big stage. If you want to be an international, you have to perform better. Whenever he got on the ball, you felt, if anything was going to happen creatively, it was going to come through him. He was taken out the game on two or three occasions and Celtic players realised he was the main threat. Not the Adam Rooney I know. Didn't do much in terms of causing a threat to the two centre-backs, who handled him extremely well. He needed to work harder to make it difficult for them but had little support. Should be a goal threat but didn't do that. Won a couple of headers, but his timing was out at times after coming on for O'Connor. Expect more from a player like him. With Hayes, who he replaced, he's the quality in terms of creativity and didn't create anything. Barely touched the ball after taking over from Rooney. Hard when coming on at 3-0 down. Had that save from Andrew Considine's first-half header but didn't have much else to do. To force his way back into the side and win a medal, you have to give him great credit. Fairly comfortable at right-back, as steady as always, and was in control defensively. Was probably the pick of the back four. Stepping out, he made the opening goal. Passed the ball well throughout. Strong, powerful figure at the back. Was never put under significant pressure. Attacked the by-line as always and delivered an early cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target. Man of the match, dominated proceedings, looked in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the defender for the next five or 10 minutes. Led by example. Solid display, worked very hard, not over-spectacular and should have scored at the end after getting himself into a great position. Always capable of doing something in the game. An attacking threat throughout. He plays the position well and scored the opening goal. Scored Celtic's second goal, laid on a couple, won the penalty for the third. I asked the question before, could he step up? And I think he did. Probably Celtic's quietest player. Wasn't involved as much as he would have wanted to be. Probably the quietest we've seen him but still scored his goal. Not as sharp as he normally is but led the line well. Did what he had do after coming on for Roberts. Kept it nice and solid in midfield. Another who did his job well and kept the performance ticking over after coming on for Rogic. Didn't have much time to impress as a late sub for Forrest but didn't do anything wrong. Pat Bonner and Willie Miller were talking to BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson.",

        "Hands shot up in agreement with what, in my humble opinion, was a pretty good case for Yorkshire declaring its immediate independence. But that was in the 1960s and the average age of those listening at the local schools' debating competition was probably under 15. We have all grown up a bit since then and so have the arguments and aspirations. The debate over the past decade has been about whether Yorkshire would be better off if it could take more control from Westminster and Whitehall. In the shadow of a referendum on independence for Scotland the opportunities for Yorkshire have clearly never been greater. \"Whatever happens in the coming Scottish independence vote, there will be more devolution,\" says Peter Box, the veteran leader of Wakefield City Council and a serious player in the debate. He is also the chairman of the combined authority which was recently set up with the government's blessing to allow neighbouring councils to take full responsibility for all public investment in road and rail links across West Yorkshire. But Mr Box is firmly of the opinion that within 10 years Yorkshire will want more. \"The genie is out the bottle, we want more power and I actually believe Yorkshire should be independent,\" he said. The fledging new political party Yorkshire First is also eyeing events in Scotland. \"Five million Scots should, of course, be represented, but so should other regions, says its leader Richard Carter. \"Yorkshire has a population of five million, an economy twice that of Wales, but with the powers of neither.\" The government appears to be leaving the door ajar as far as giving limited devolved powers to at least some sort of \"Northern\" political body is concerned. Over the past few months David Cameron, George Osborne and Nick Clegg have all lugged their soapboxes to Yorkshire promising billions of extra taxpayers' money will be heading \"up north\" accompanied by local autonomy on how it should be spent. The Labour leader Ed Miliband gave similar assurances as I trailed him around a factory floor near Leeds. It is over a decade since the last Labour government's proposals for directly-elected regional assemblies for the three northern regions of Yorkshire, the North West and the North East drowned in a sea of public apathy. \"Times have changed,\" I was assured by James Alexander, one of the new generation of senior Labour leaders that have emerged in Yorkshire since then. \"The idea got swamped by arguments over a new tier of government and how much more professional politicians would be paid,\" he told me in an interview for the BBC Look North. \"Now we need a better way of making sure our needs are determined here in Yorkshire and not in Westminster.\" Despite the obvious high-level political support for more devolved powers practical details are scarce. It is more likely to be channelled through groups of existing bodies such as Local Enterprise Partnerships, city regions or local councils than any new directly elected assembly. As for my long-forgotten speech calling for independence? Well, it turned out the audience much preferred the ideas put forward by another debater. He argued Yorkshire folk ought be doing more to join the sexual revolution - well, it was the 1960s.",
        "Jacqui Thompson was arrested in 2011 for filming a Carmarthenshire council meeting and sued Mark James for libel. He counter-sued for posts made on her blog and received PS25,000 in damages. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Mrs Thompson had been charged with an harassment offence but a decision was taken to discontinue her case. Mrs Thompson, of Llanwrda, said she was \"relieved\" at the news and had been worried about her impending court case, which was due to take place on Thursday. A CPS spokesman said: \"Following a review, prosecutors were no longer satisfied there was a realistic prospect of conviction due to insufficient evidence and therefore made the decision to discontinue the case.\" Mrs Thompson became embroiled in the legal row after she was arrested in June 2011 for refusing to stop filming a council meeting for her blog, in which she was critical of the authority. She sued Mr James the following November and he successfully counter-sued in a private lawsuit. In 2016, the High Court found Mrs Thompson had run a campaign of \"harassment, defamation and intimidation\" against Mr James. She was told to pay back PS250 a month to him over the next 10 years to cover the damages. Carmarthenshire council covered Mr James' legal costs, a decision the Wales Audit Office later found to be unlawful. But the authority is pursuing Mrs Thompson for PS190,393 in legal costs. The council would not comment on the latest development in the case, which it said was a private matter for Mr James. Mr James has been asked to comment.",

        "The 51-year-old had been negotiating a release from his contract following a rift with the board over his budget. Hughes has been with the Highlanders since December 2013 and won the Scottish Cup last year, the club's first major honour. \"John will be remembered as a member of a great winning team,\" read a brief statement from Inverness CT. Hughes had become increasingly frustrated at the loss of key squad members and spoke of his disappointment when an approach from Dundee United was blocked earlier this season. Having previously managed at Falkirk, Hibernian, Hartlepool and Livingston, he replaced Terry Butcher at the Caledonian Stadium. As well as lifting the Scottish Cup, Hughes steered Inverness to a third place finish in the Premiership last season, with this campaign opening with their first taste of European football. In March 2014, Inverness reached the League Cup final, losing on penalties to Aberdeen. The Inverness statement contained a message on behalf of Hughes, saying: \"I will look back on my time in the Highlands with a genuine fondness and warm affection for the club, the area and the community. \"The welcome I received from the fans and the response I got from the players throughout my two-and-a-half years there will live long in the memory as will everything else we shared in some of the ground-breaking successes we all enjoyed together during that period. \"I can readily assure my successor that they will inherit an excellent group of players and to each and every one of them could I also say a huge thanks for making my time with them so successful and so memorable - I wish them and the club every success in the future.\"",
        "They read from Attack of the Shidas about children from different Kenyan communities working together to protect their well from an alien invasion. The event is meant to foster a culture of reading in the country, the organisers told the BBC. The US currently holds the Guinness World Record set by 233,000 people. It will take at least a week to work out whether they have been successful as they need to tally the number of pupils from across the country who participated. Kenyan children's book author Muthoni Muchemi led the event with 1,700 students reading from her book at Hospital Hill Primary School in the capital, Nairobi. Afterwards, she said she wanted to break the stereotype that Africans do not care for books. \"Growing up I would always hear that if you want to hide something from an African, put it in a book - and it was really upsetting to me,\" she told the BBC. \"I want to help change that perception and the first step is to re-introduce reading not just as important but enjoyable,\" she said. \"I have seen over the years that a lot of families don't have libraries in their homes but have they have big TVs. We need to get parents to understand that reading for pleasure with their children is an important part of brain development.\" The 13- and 14-year-olds, dressed in grey and white uniforms, who chorused the words at Hospital Hill Primary School said they enjoyed the challenge. \"I enjoy reading because it teaches me about other people and places. It teaches me about the world,\" one girl said. Another student said he thought Attack of the Shidas had important life lessons about working together and accepting people's differences. It is not the first time Kenya has tried to break the record - last year 142,279 children read aloud in 360 schools. This time, Ms Muchemi is more optimistic about the Storymoja National Read Aloud attempt. But she says in the end it is about building confidence in children. \"If you master reading it means you've increased your vocabulary, you have good command of sentence structure, your facility with language is improved. It can't help but build your confidence,\" she said. \"Exposure to different stories makes you more confident in your place in the world because you no longer feel alone. It's served me very well because I grew up in a deep rural area.\"",
        "Dockery, who plays Lady Mary in ITV's hit period drama, will play Madame de Tourvel in the production, heading up the London theatre's autumn season. Janet McTeer and West co-star as ruthless former lovers Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont. Artistic director Josie Rourke will helm Christopher Hampton's play. Les Liaisons Dangereuses is based on the scandalous 1782 novel by Choderlos de Laclos, which told of sex, intrigue and betrayal amongst aristocrats in pre-revolutionary France. Its first theatre production 30 years ago starred Alan Rickman, Juliet Stevenson and Lesley Manville and won both the Olivier and Evening Standard Awards for best play. Hampton went on to win an Oscar for best adapted screenplay for the 1988 film version starring Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer. \"I have long wanted to direct Christopher Hampton's superb Les Liaisons Dangereuses,\" said Rourke, \"and the cast we have drawn together is a testament to the brilliance of his play.\" Along with his stage work, West has appeared in TV dramas The Wire, The Hour and The Affair, while McTeer was recently seen in acclaimed drama The Honourable Woman and The White Queen. Other highlights at the 250-seat theatre this autumn include the first major London run of Abi Morgan's early play Splendour, which will star Zawe Ashton, Sinead Cusack, Michelle Fairley and Genevieve O'Reilly. Morgan has since gone on to write films such as The Iron Lady, Shame and the forthcoming Suffragette. Splendour tells the story of a photojournalist at the heart of a coup in an eastern European state and will be directed by associate director Robert Hastie. \"One of the things that most excites me about this season is the strong leading roles for women,\" said Rourke. \"It is a thrill to announce a season of work that features, in plays by living writers, women of the calibre and power of Zawe Ashton, Sinead Cusack, Michelle Dockery, Michelle Fairley, Genevieve O'Reilly and Janet McTeer, who returns to the Donmar and the London stage.\" The Royal Court's former artistic director Dominic Cooke will direct the UK Premiere of Teddy Ferrara, Christopher Shinn's play about a student tragedy which sends a campus into turmoil. This autumn will also see the transfer of Phyllida Lloyd's all-female Henry IV to St Ann's Warehouse in New York. Lloyd has just been announced as the theatre's new associate director.

        "But on Monday the Church of England broke a tradition inherited from the first Christians 2,000 years ago when the three houses of the General Synod voted to allow women to be bishops. Since the days of Jesus and his 12 male apostles the Church has had exclusively male leaders - bishops whose authority has been handed down the generations by the laying on of hands. Hilary Cotton chairs Women and the Church, which campaigns for women bishops. \"Saying yes to women bishops is a cosmic shift,\" she says. \"It changes our whole understanding of what God intended people to be, and even changes the Church's theology by recognising that men and women are equally chosen to lead it.\" A senior figure on the \"high church\" wing of the Anglicanism, Prebendary David Houlding, says creating women bishops represents \"a massive shift\" in the way the Church presented itself to the world. \"It's an unprecedented acceptance by the Church of the secular values of society,\" he says. \"There was a lot of damage to the Church's reputation when the measure was defeated before. It's terrified of sending the wrong signal again.\" Samuel Margrave, who also opposes the legislation, told the Synod: \"This is a show for the media. It's the end of the Church as we know it.\" The Reverend Lindsay Southern, the Vicar of Catterick in North Yorkshire, who supports the proposals, said a single vote for woman bishops would have huge long-term effects. \"It might look like a small change in direction from the outside, but it's like a ship at sea - a change in course over time will lead us to a completely different place.\" Women now constitute a third of the 11,000 Anglican priests, several of whom have reached senior positions. The Church's 42 dioceses have given unanimous backing to the latest proposals. But to take such a profound step, each of the Synod's three houses - representing bishops, clergy and lay people - needed to support legislation to create women bishops by a majority of two-thirds. The legislation failed in November 2012 because lay synod members who supported women bishops nevertheless believed that traditionalists were not getting sufficient exemptions from serving under them. The latest proposals would allow traditionalist parishes to ask a woman bishop for a male alternative, and take any dispute over the process to an independent ombudsman. \"There will be an'expectation' that bishops will do their best to accommodate (traditionalist) parishes,\" says Prebendary Rod Thomas, the leader of the conservative evangelical group, Reform. \"But in the end it depends on trust, and that is the big question. Will there be trust?\" Evangelical traditionalists oppose women bishops because of their belief that the Bible calls for men to head churches. Traditionalists on the Catholic, or High Church, wing of Anglicanism believe that because Jesus chose only men to make up his 12 apostles, only men should lead the Church. In fact some do not believe that women can be priests, so that were a woman bishop to ordain a man as a priest, he would not truly be a priest. High Church traditionalists will look for alternative male bishops who have been ordained by a man, and who have not themselves ordained women as priests. With the tide of opinion in the Church, and in wider society, running against them, traditionalists are being offered much less than they wanted. After the legislation is passed, and if Parliament approves it, the new law will be \"promulgated\" by the Synod in November. Committees looking for bishops for the vacancies in Newcastle, Oxford and Peterborough could then interview women candidates. Senior bishops elsewhere might more quickly appoint a woman in the more junior role of assistant or \"suffragan\" bishop. Other Anglican churches already have women bishops - there are 20 in Canada, Australia, the United States, Cuba, India, New Zealand, Swaziland and South Africa. The Church of Ireland, which covers Northern Ireland, appointed Rev Pat Storey, as the first woman bishop in the UK in September, 2013.",
        "The move to make the state property registry secret is not yet law - it still has to go before parliament. TI, an anti-corruption watchdog, said the new measure would \"raise the impunity of government officials.\" It was proposed by the Federal Security Service (FSB), successor of the KGB. A government committee approved the proposal this week. Most Russian MPs are government supporters, so it looks likely to become law. \"This could make it harder to tackle money-laundering and illicit enrichment,\" said Andrey Zhvirblis, deputy director of TI's Russian branch. TI's annual Corruption Perceptions Index gives Russia a poor rating for 2014. It ranks 136th out of 175 countries, below Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Mexico. The FSB also wants to block public access to registries listing officials' ownership of planes and yachts. But many of those assets are registered overseas, often by companies, whereas home ownership in Russia is more serious, Mr Zhvirblis said. The FSB argues that ordinary citizens should be denied access to the Unified State Registry of Property Rights, a real estate database. Only official bodies would be allowed to use that data freely without the property owner's permission, under the FSB plan. The FSB says that criminals have abused open access to the registry, and that commercial databases are profiting from the personal data. Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, has exposed cases of civil servants owning property that appears lavish compared with their official salaries. Before the open registry's introduction in the 1990s, Mr Zhvirblis said, there were thousands of abuses involving fraudulent claims to property. The new measure risks making home ownership and tenancies less secure and \"will affect almost everyone,\" he told the BBC from Moscow. Currently a buyer can get the necessary ownership details from the registry for just 200 roubles (PS2; 3), he said. Even so, he pointed out, \"it just gives the plot of land and owner's name\" - not more personal data. Mr Zhvirblis said it was not the role of the FSB to draft Russian laws, and \"it's strange that it's becoming an entity doing that.\" President Putin ran the FSB in the late 1990s before becoming president. He had been an officer in the Soviet KGB, the communist secret police. The news website Lenta.ru says the new proposal coincides with certain restrictions on Russian access to offshore havens. Western financial sanctions on Russia, as well as global anti-corruption efforts, have made the offshore option less attractive, it reports. Putting a veil of secrecy on property in Russia could reduce the incentive for officials to keep their wealth overseas.",
        "But with their complete silence as Nicky Morgan walked on stage, low cries of rubbish and then loud outraged laughter as she answered questions, head teachers here at the NAHT conference in Birmingham made clear quite how disillusioned they're feeling. It's not just the plans to force all schools to become academies, which will affect primary schools most, as few have chosen to go down that route. It's also the changes, delays and uncertainty around primary testing which have left the Department for Education looking ham-fisted. The decision to postpone baseline testing for children starting school for a year, was closely followed by the accidental publishing of test papers for seven-year-olds online. This all falls within the remit of schools minister Nick Gibb - so one head asked if he was running the department. A question Nicky Morgan dismissed as \"sexist.\" It's never great to have to start a speech with an apology, which the education secretary did today on the leaked test paper. She offered significant reassurance that many schools won't suddenly find themselves marked down this year as a result of Sats tests. But the speech, to a union which has tried harder than most to engage with the government, left them cold. And these are the head teachers who are meant to be taking the initiative in deciding what kind of academy trust they want to form. It would offer them greater freedom to make their own decisions, Nicky Morgan told them. The loudest applause was for the head teacher who told her being forced to change wasn't the kind of freedom they needed. It was at best an uncomfortable encounter, and ministers can and have been describing union opposition as coming from \"vested interests.\" Less easy to ignore are the many Conservative councillors and some MPs who are already very queasy about the forced academy plans.",
        "Laura Turner sent a series of lewd messages to one of her co-workers while on duty, the Health and Care Professionals Council tribunal heard. Staff at the University Hospital of North Durham said her comments had a \"devastating\" effect on the department. Ms Turner said she was \"disgusted\" with her actions. During the hearing in Kennington, South London, one of the victims said in a statement she was angry and in disbelief and \"went to have a little cry\" after the incident. Ms Turner's line manager Judith Allen described the messages as humiliating and degrading and said the department was shocked at the content and her \"unprofessional behaviour.\" Ms Turner, who did not attend the hearing, was dismissed after the Facebook comments were shared in March 2014. Panel chairman Philip Geering said: \"The panel is of the view that the registrant's conduct fell well short of what would be proper in the circumstances and breached the standards of the HCPC.\" He said sending messages that were sexually explicit and degrading to her colleagues while on duty in a clinical setting made her actions \"even more unacceptable.\" During the tribunal, Ms Turner was described as having a \"cavalier\" attitude to patient confidentiality, after it was revealed she shared photographs with X-rays and patient notes visible in the background. Mr Geering said her \"sufficiently serious\" actions posed a \"significant risk\" in undermining public confidence in the trust and in the health care profession. Ms Turner accepted writing and sending the comments during an interview as part of an internal investigation, the hearing was told, but claimed she was \"easily led\" and said her colleague \"told me what to write.\" Mr Geering said she had failed to show \"meaningful remorse\" and was \"focused on the impact on her personally and the risk of losing her job.\"",
        "An international team of maritime archaeologists are diving, excavating and recording the wreck of Dutch ship the Rooswijk off the Kent coast. All 300 shipmen died when the vessel, carrying coins and silver ingots, sank on Goodwin Sands in January 1740. Never before have any of the Dutch East India Company's 250 wrecks been scientifically excavated on this scale. Historic England manages the protected site and is working with the Dutch government, which owns the ship's remains. It is only now, after more than 250 years, that the sands have shifted enough to unveil the wreckage. Some explorations were carried out last year and those finds are being showcased as part of the Rooswijk1740 project, led and financed by the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, with open days in Ramsgate between 19 August and 16 September. They include a large seaman's chest, pewter jugs, ornately carved wooden knife handles and leather shoes. The current mission will see archaeologists delve further into the storage rooms and living quarters in the stern of the ship. Martijn Manders, project leader of the Rooswijk Excavation and Maritime Heritage programme manager at the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, said: \"The Goodwin Sands has been a treacherous place for ships throughout the centuries and is now a treasure trove for archaeologists. \"The rapidly shifting sands mean that the site is even more exposed now than it was during our initial dives to assess the condition of the Rooswijk last year. This makes the excavation urgent.\" The wreck is high on the Heritage at Risk register due to its exposed remains and vulnerability to the shifting sands. Alison James, maritime archaeologist at Historic England, said: \"Wrecks such as the Rooswijk are time capsules that offer a unique glimpse into the past and tell a story. \"We look forward to the fascinating insights and discoveries that the Rooswijk excavation will uncover this summer.\"",

        "Alice Gibson-Watt, 34, died in 2012 from a brain injury caused by a cardiac arrest, an inquest jury concluded. A week earlier, she was restrained by police and ambulance staff in a case of post-partum psychosis, a month after giving birth to her first child. The coroner ruled the use of restraint was not a factor in the death. Her widower, Anthony Gibson-Watt, thanked the coroner for investigating the circumstances leading to the death of his wife. \"It will never bring Alice back, but it has given us a better understanding of how she came to die and in time may help us to move forward,\" he said. The inquest heard that she was admitted to AE at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital following the psychotic episode and then taken to the Lakeside Mental Health Unit in West Middlesex Hospital. At around 03:00 GMT on 16 November Mrs Gibson-Watt, a jewellery specialist for Sotheby's, had a cardiac arrest. A nurse checked and found no pulse, the inquest heard. Her heart was recorded as restarted at 03:48, after emergency paramedics had used a defibrillator. She was moved to a life support machine at King's College Hospital in London, but died on 20 November after a brain scan pronounced her \"life extinct.\" Doctors giving evidence at the inquest said that if there had been a proper response to the cardiac arrest, the brain injury that ultimately caused her death could have been avoided. Mr Gibson-Watt had called 999 after his wife started screaming, wailing and crawling around on all fours on 13 November. He told the inquest at West London Coroner's Court that she was suffering delusions that their daughter had died. He also told the court that he and Alice met when she was 18 and he was 21. They had married nine years later. \"Our romance was long and wonderful,\" he said afterwards. \"We were a lucky couple: best friends, soul mates with entwined interests.\" He added that one day he will tell his four-year-old daughter about her wonderful mother. \"Alice insisted on a drug-free birth to give her daughter the very best start possible. She was enthralled by motherhood,\" he said. Postpartum psychosis is a serious mental illness that affects around one in 1,000 women after they have a baby. The main symptoms are hallucinations - hearing and seeing things that aren't there - and delusions - thoughts that are not likely to be true. Experiencing psychosis tends to happen within the first two weeks after giving birth, but it can develop later too. It can severely alter someone's thinking, emotions and behaviour. Experts don't know why it occurs in some women, but fluctuations in hormones and changing sleep patterns are thought to play a role. Women are more likely to develop the illness if another member of their family has had it too.",

The Team Sky rider had opened a 21-second lead heading into stage seven and held out to win by 12 seconds from Frenchman Romain Bardet. Froome won the Tour de France after both his previous Dauphine successes. This year's edition begins on 2 July. The 31-year-old had to survive some nervous moments in the final 15km on Sunday, as Spaniard Alberto Contador launched several accelerations on the penultimate climb. Bardet also tried his chances on a rapid descent between the final two climbs but Froome chased down every attack. Cummings, 35, was the last of a 20-man breakaway group to wilt and finished well clear of the chasing pack. Ireland's Dan Martin won the sprint for second with Bardet third, and both moved up a place in the overall standings thanks to the bonus points available on the line.

        "Michal Podlaszczyk had already served 12 and a half years for the equivalent of manslaughter in his native Poland in 2003 when he was 18. A year after his release he came to the UK and in October raped and robbed a woman in a Leicester park. Podlaszczyk, 33, was jailed again on Wednesday for a minimum of seven and a half years. He had previously admitted nine different charges including rape, sexual assault and robbery. Leicester Crown Court heard Podlaszczyk attacked a 55-year-old woman as she walked to the bus station through Bede Park shortly after 07:00. He punched her to the ground, dragged her to a secluded part and raped her. During the attack he took her bank card and demanded her Pin number in order to steal PS20 from her account. He also took her mobile phone and PS1.15 from her purse saying he needed money for beer. Prosecuting, Jim Thomas said the woman was left with injuries to her knees and face, including a denture being knocked out. Reading a statement from the victim, Mr Thomas said: \"She is frightened to go out and is constantly worried when there's a knock at the door.\" Podlaszczyk had been released from prison in Poland in July 2015 and settled in the UK last August. Judge Philip Head called the attack \"sadistic\" and described the defendant as a \"damaged and dangerous\" killer. He said the defendant took \"great pleasure from it [the attack] by humiliating her by some disgusting actions.\" \"This was motivated by sex and he thought he could profit at the same time.\"",
        "Rocket Lab's 17m-long (56ft) Electron lifted off from the Mahia Peninsula, in the North Island, the firm said. The test flight was the first launch from New Zealand and is a major first step in an emerging market: launching cheap disposable rockets to carry small satellites and other payloads. The company plans to start frequent commercial launches later this year. Poor weather conditions had pushed the launch into the fourth day of a 10-day window and the Electron finally cleared its pad at 16:20 local time (04:20 GMT). The launch was conducted with no media or spectators permitted, but the company released a video of the lift-off on its Twitter page. \"It was a great flight,\" chief executive Peter Beck said in a statement after the launch, adding though that the rocket did not quite reach orbit, the path on which its future cargo would embark on its revolution of the Earth. \"We'll be investigating why, however reaching space in our first test puts us in an incredibly strong position to accelerate the commercial phase of our programme, deliver our customers to orbit and make space open for business.\" The test launch, one of three planned, did not carry a payload as such, although it was packed with sensor equipment to help engineers understand how the flight performed. Eventually, Rocket Lab says it will be lofting payloads up to 150kg (331lbs) into a 500km-high orbits that go from pole to pole. We're on the cusp of something quite exciting. Innovative companies are packaging really capable technologies into very small, low-cost satellites. Their data will drive myriad new services - from helping city officials keep track of urban development to giving farmers information about the performance of their crops. But if this new wave is to succeed it needs cheaper access to space. At the moment, the economics and flight schedules of these small satellites are still being defined by the availability and price of a ride on a big rocket. Rocket Lab aims to change that. And there others, such as Richard Branson's LauncherOne project. Rocket Lab's second vehicle is already built and set to fly in the next couple months. Keep an eye on the end of the year too because this USNZ outfit even has a contract to send a small lander to the Moon. Rocket Lab's founder and chief executive Peter Beck is from New Zealand and the firm has a New Zealand subsidiary. The country has less air traffic, compared to say the US, so there is less need for flights to be rerouted every time a rocket is sent to space. New Zealand is also positioned well to get satellites into a north-to-south orbit around Earth. The trajectory takes the rocket out over open water, far from from people and property. The country hopes these favourable factors will help it become a low-cost space hub. Nice touch: The Electron has nine engines on its first stage and one engine on its second stage. They are called Rutherford engines - after the great New Zealand-born physicist Ernest Rutherford , who famously split the atom in 1917. Private and commercial rocket launches are becoming more and more common - the most famous example being Elon Musk and his SpaceX Falcon rockets. But the SpaceX vehicles are huge and are aimed at following in the footsteps of Nasa missions, delivering cargo to the international space station and eventually sending people to Mars. Rocket Lab's goal is to launch what, by comparison, is a tiny rocket for a fraction of the price, but with much more frequency. The Electron is a mere 17m long and 1.2m in diameter. Each launch only costs about 5m. Rocket Lab wants to conduct 50 or more a year. Just to put this all into perspective: SpaceX's current Falcon rocket is a towering 70m and can carry 22,800kg into low-Earth orbit for a standard price of 62m. Rocket Lab's website already allows you to book a slot for your satellite. The cheapest deal is a small cubesat on a rideshare option - prices start at 77,000 (PS59,280).",
        "An all-party group has called on the UK government to consider devolving some immigration control. That could involve Wales being able to set its own visas and migration quotas. And the group chairman said immigrants should have to learn English or Welsh. The UK government said different rules for different areas would cause difficulties for employers. Currently, there is no separate Welsh immigration policy. A number of recommendations have made by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration (APPGSI) report on how the UK's immigration system could promote better integration. It said speaking English was \"the key to full participation in our society and economy.\" Group chairman Chuka Umunna MP said he wanted Wales to have a bigger say in developing immigration policies. \"This is a really hot topic, it's become very toxic, very polarised and we want to build a consensus on what a new system could look like,\" he told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme. When asked if immigrants could learn Welsh if living and working in Wales as an alternative to English, he said: \"Absolutely. Why not?,\" adding that people could not fully integrate in society if they could not speak the language. David Davies, Conservative MP for Monmouth, called it a \"ludicrous idea.\" \"People will just go to whichever nation.... is offering the easiest visas and move to where they want to move to,\" he told BBC Wales. \"Once they've got a visa to go to Wales there will be nothing to stop them going to England or vice versa.\" The MPs' report claims the UK's existing points-based immigration system is \"generally unresponsive to demographic, economic and cultural differences between our constituent nations and regions.\" \"Shaping immigration criteria to address nation or region-specific economic and cultural needs might instil confidence among members of the public that the immigration system works for their area,\" the study said. It added: \"Enabling nations and regions to set regional immigration quotas would create new incentives for politicians to actively make the case for immigration in their area.\" Devolution could involve the introduction of region-specific visas, with quotas for how many are issued. Canada is given as an example, where all 10 provincial governments are allowed to set region-specific requirements for immigrants. Immigrants are required to live in the region that approves their visa until they become eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship. The province of Quebec is also able to set its own criteria for its visas and evaluate applications. A small element of regional policy on immigration already exists in the UK, where Scotland has a list of occupations in addition to a UK-wide version where employers can advertise outside of the EU without first advertising domestically. The UK government, the report said, should appoint an independent commission to explore how a devolved or regionally-led immigration system might work. Questions for the commission could include extending existing powers for Scotland to Wales, Northern Ireland, London and the English metro regions, and whether the UK government might copy the Quebec model. A Welsh Government spokesman said: \"It is important that the needs of Wales are reflected in future migration policies and that people who settle here are supported to integrate into communities.\" Plaid Cymru external affairs spokesman Steffan Lewis said: \"Plaid Cymru has long advocated a Welsh visa system to boost our public services such as the NHS and support the private sector in attracting high-skilled workers from around the world. \"It is also of great regret that Westminster policies have damaged our reputation as a destination for international students. \"Student visas should be devolved and would benefit our universities and our economy.\" A UK government spokeswoman said: \"Applying different immigration rules to different parts of the United Kingdom will complicate the immigration system, harming its integrity and causing difficulties for employers who need the flexibility to deploy their staff to other parts of the UK.\" She said the UK government was rolling out a PS20m fund for English language provision and had made PS140m available to councils to manage impacts on communities \"caused by issues such as poor English language skills.\" The spokeswoman added: \"We must also recognise that uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion and puts pressure on public services. \"Our priority is to build an immigration system that works for everyone in the UK and delivers the control we need.\"",
        "Allan Stanley, 76, of Nefyn, was snorkelling around the island of Gozo when he was hit on 19 June. His widow Diane told the inquest in Caernarfon it happened in seconds. She said: \"There wasn't enough time for me to shout or do anything.\" A conclusion of accidental death was recorded by coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones. The inquest heard Mr Stanley was snorkelling in a bay when a rigid inflatable boat started up. \"A person snorkelling is very difficult to see,\" Mr Pritchard-Jones said. \"At best it's only part of the top of the head that can be seen. \"Whether the person operating the boat looked or made any efforts to see if anyone was in the water, I can't say.\" Pathologist Dr Mark Lord told the inquest Mr Stanley suffered head injuries and his death was \"likely to have been virtually instantaneous.\"",
        "The local development plan is looking at how the area will grow after 2016 and the potential for 14,000 new jobs being created. Consultation is expected to start in December on 100 sites which could be earmarked for development. However, final details will not be decided until Spring 2015. The plan proposes development areas: Developments in the past have involved transforming the maritime quarter, the docklands for the SA1 housing and the lower Swansea valley. But the council admits that regenerating existing sites would not provide for all the city's future needs and it will need \"significant additional - primarily greenfield - land for development.\" As well as \"strategic\" development sites for more than 500 homes and in some cases up to 1,000 homes, some existing housing areas will be expanded with up to 400 new homes. The city currently has a population of around 240,500 supporting 107,000 jobs. It expects over the next 10 years to be the economic hub and main driver of the new Swansea Bay City Region, which held its first meeting this week. Robert Francis Davies, cabinet member for enterprise, development and regeneration, said: \"Swansea is a city which is constantly developing. \"We know that the population will increase significantly in the coming years and we need to ensure that this city can develop in the right way, providing adequate space for housing and for economic growth.\" Councillors will be asked to put the next stage of the Local Development Plan (LDP) out to a month-long consultation.",
        "New figures show the total number of teachers across Scotland has risen, but 12 council areas saw numbers fall. Mr Swinney said the stats were \"good news\" in light of recruitment \"challenges\" in some areas. Opposition parties said numbers were still down over the long term. And they said parents \"have a right to be very angry\" about the attainment gap between pupils from better and worse-off backgrounds. The latest figures showed teacher numbers were up for the first time in several years, with 51,000 employed in state schools in 2016. But in 12 local authorities the numbers fell, with the largest percentage drop in Moray, which has highlighted recruitment problems in the past. The figures were among a fresh batch of important statistics being published on the state of the Scottish education system. The ratio of pupils to teachers was maintained across Scotland but the average size of a class crept up slightly to 23.5 students. Nationally, the number of teachers fell between 2010 and 2014 then stabilised. The number of teachers fell in 12 council areas, including in Highland and Dumfries and Galloway, although in both these regions the ratio of pupils to teachers was maintained at the same level. In 12 council areas the ratio of pupils to teachers got worse in 2016, including in Edinburgh and Fife where teacher numbers had risen. These were: The government expects the ratio of pupils to teachers to be maintained, although BBC Scotland understands the councils will not face any financial sanctions. Many councils have told BBC Scotland that they are finding it hard to fill some vacancies. Recently the Scottish government unveiled a number of initiatives to try to encourage more people into teaching, and some local authorities have also launched their own initiatives. The latest statistics also showed: Separate figures, published on Tuesday, looked at the number of children considered by teachers to be performing at the required level for their age in Curriculum for Excellence. The data showed that between 65 and 85 of pupils in primary schools achieved the relevant level in aspects of literacy and numeracy. However, the proportion of pupils achieving the relevant level for their stage decreased throughout the primary stages. Updating MSPs on the figures, Mr Swinney said: \"I very much welcome the rise in teacher numbers compared to last year, the fact that class sizes are broadly stable and that the pupil-teacher ratio has been maintained. \"This is all good news, particularly when you consider the teacher recruitment challenges being faced in some areas. \"The data shows that significant improvements are required in some local authorities, and real challenges exist in delivering the progress in literacy and numeracy we seek. \"There is much to be proud of in Scottish education; we need to remain focused on and committed to Curriculum for Excellence and we need to continue to implement the reforms we are putting in place.\" Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, welcomed the rise in teacher numbers but said some \"significant challenges\" continued to face schools. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: \"The number of teachers employed across Scotland has held steady, and actually shows a small increase overall, indicating the local authorities have adhered to a commitment brokered between the EIS and local and national government to maintain teacher numbers over the year. \"This is very welcome, and is helping to improve employment prospects for qualified teachers and ensure that young people have consistent levels of provision in schools across Scotland. \"The EIS would certainly expect the Scottish government to continue its commitment to maintaining teacher numbers, and we hope to hear confirmation soon from the finance minister in his forthcoming financial statement.\" He added: \"Given the welcome Scottish government commitment to tackling the attainment gap, the trend of rising class sizes is an issue that must be tackled through greater investment in a greater number of qualified teachers.\" The Scottish Conservatives said teacher numbers were still thousands below the levels they were at in 2007. The party's education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: \"With teacher numbers having plummeted from the levels they were at a decade ago, it once again calls into question whether the CfE can be delivered properly. \"There are a number of legitimate concerns about the curriculum, and these statistics are further evidence that we need to have proper independent scrutiny of how it is being implemented.\" Ms Smith also told Mr Swinney that parents \"have a right to be very angry\" about the gulf in achievement between pupils from differing financial circumstances. The Scottish Greens' education spokesman Ross Greer questioned the government's decision to publish statistics on how well schools pupils were doing in certain areas of the Curriculum for Excellence. He said: \"Today's figures demonstrate the utterly bizarre education priorities the Scottish government has. We see class sizes continue to creep up, making them the highest they've been since the SNP formed the government and nine years after they promised to reduce them to 18. \"More teachers and smaller classes are vital if we're to improve the quality of education.\" Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale accused the SNP of \"slashing\" spending on Scotland's school pupils by more than 8. She highlighted analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) which she said showed that real-terms spend on education fell from PS6,692-per-pupil in 201011 to PS6,152 in 2014-15. She said: \"Nicola Sturgeon promised to make education her top priority, but Scotland has plunged down the international league tables on her watch. \"Year-on-year cuts to school budgets, teacher numbers and support staff are damaging the life chances of Scotland's children.\" Scottish Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Tavish Scott MSP said: \"Today's figures show that after a decade in power, the SNP has failed to deliver on its commitment of smaller class sizes for our youngest pupils.\" The latest figures a week after it emerged that Scotland's schools had recorded their worst-ever performance in an international survey of pupils. The country's scores for maths, reading and science all declined in the latest set of Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) figures. It was the first time since the tests began in 2000 that Scotland's performance in all three subject areas was classed as \"average,\" with none \"above average,\" among the 72 countries that took part. The Curriculum for Excellence has been introduced in Scottish schools in recent years, with the country's qualifications system also overhauled. However, teaching unions have complained about \"excessive and unsustainable\" workloads as a result of some of the changes.",
        "They last for three months, which is long enough to sap the finances of the political parties and the energy of voters, battered by a never-ending string of cheap shots in cheap internet videos. Campaign 2015 is coming to the boil rather nicely now with the latest opinion polls suggesting that a centre-left alliance is running ahead of the hawkish Likud Party headed by Benjamin Netanyahu. That does not necessarily mean he will be forced from office - he could still form a right-wing coalition. But election night on 17 March promises to be an exciting affair. Outsiders, though, might be surprised that the moribund state of the vexed peace process between Israel and the Palestinians has never felt like a major campaign issue. It is there in the background all the time, of course, as the central historical and strategic issue that his faced this country since the Middle East war of 1967 when it captured Gaza from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan. It captured the Golan Heights from Syria too, but that raises a different set of strategic issues which are separate from this particular diplomatic equation. Voters know that the Zionist Union - the name chosen for the alliance between Yitzhak Herzog's Labour Party and Tzipi Livni's movement Hatnuah - would approach the prospect of talking to the Palestinians about a \"land-for-peace\" deal with more enthusiasm than Mr Netanyahu. At one point in the campaign there was a brief controversy about whether a speech Mr Netanyahu made six years ago, cautiously embracing the concept of the Two-State solution, was still valid. His view appears to be that in an unstable Middle East where Iraq and Syria are disintegrating a newly-created Palestinian state could quickly become an ungoverned territory over-run by Islamist extremists. His many detractors might see in that an excuse for avoiding a deal for which he did not have much enthusiasm in the first place, but part of Mr Netanyahu's pitch to the Israeli people is that he is cautious in such matters - a steady, statesmanlike hand on matters affecting Israel's security. So while the peace process might be the prism through which outsiders tend to view Israeli politics, this campaign has centred much more on the economy - problems like the way in which the cost of housing outstrips the spending power of ordinary Israelis are front and centre. And what political scientists call the low-participation rate of the ultra-Orthodox communities in the economy and in the army is a major fault-line between secularists like the Yesh Atid movement and the religious parties like Shas. Yaakov Peri is a former head of Israel's internal security agency the Shin Bet - a job which required him to reflect deeply on his country's relationship with Palestinian society as he bore responsibility for neutralising the threat of militant groups. Before the last coalition collapsed he was Minister of Science and Technology and this time around he is a candidate once again for the centrist Yesh Atid. He says this is an issue where it is up to the government to lead. \"The Israeli public cares about the cost of living and housing and the street doesn't feel the urgency of a deal with the Palestinians or a regional approach,\" he told me. \"It's a reality and you should look at it when running an election campaign.\" You get a sense of the tensions that brought down the last coalition when you discuss the same issues with Naftali Bennett, leader of the nationalist right-wing party Habayit Hayehudi who also sat in the outgoing cabinet. He has said that there should never be a Palestinian state in the West Bank because to create one would be to create an existential threat to the Jewish State. \"It would,\" he said, \"spell calamity for the future of Israel.... handing land over to Palestinians doesn't bring peace, it brings catastrophe.... This formula that the West is obsessed with, of land-for-peace simply doesn't work.\" If the right wins the election, Mr Bennett is certain to be back in the cabinet where he would be a sceptical voice against any international diplomatic manoeuvring to get the two sides back to the negotiating table. The Palestinian people of the West Bank and Gaza of course have no vote in Israel elections - although a small number in East Jerusalem who have applied successfully for Israeli citizenship are an exception to that rule. But the Arab population of Israel itself - descendants of those who remained after the fighting in Israel's War of Independence in 1948-49 - does have the right to vote. It makes up about about 15 of the electorate and that proportion will rise as its young people reach voting age. The three traditional Arab parties have combined into a unified list which is hoping to raise the turnout in that community. And if they succeed, one of their candidates Aida Touma Suleiman told me, they intend to put the peace process back on the national agenda - not least because they see a clear link between economic and security issues. \"This should be the centre of the campaign,\" Ms Suleiman said. \"There's no issue you can discuss without making a connection to the continuation of the occupation and war policy that different governments have led in the last few years. \"If you want to talk about housing you need solutions that come with resources and then you should ask where the resources are in this country.\" Over the course of the campaign, though, those kind of connections have not dominated the national debate here. How quickly the issue re-asserts itself will depend on whether victory goes to the left or to the right.",
        "But what really strikes you, especially in those initial developmental stages, is how familiar the forms look. How like an early human foetus, they appear. \"This is something you see time and time again in vertebrates, not just with mammals,\" says Richard Sabin, the Natural History Museum's top whale expert. \"You see these similarities in the early developmental stages and it's really not until you're halfway through the gestation - which for a humpback whale is around 11 months - that you start to see the things that make that foetus characteristically the species that it is.\" Richard has a remarkable sequence of seven humpback foetuses that he's going to put on display for the NHM's major summer exhibition on cetaceans. They go from what is essentially just a ball of cells that's perhaps only a few weeks old, all the way through to a specimen that appears to be a perfect humpback in miniature. This larger foetus, about half a metre in length, is probably seven to eight months into the gestation period. It has everything you would expect to see in a humpback, including those long, tell-tale pectoral flippers with their nobbly tubercles. The specimens were collected at the beginning of the 20th Century by scientists who had been sent to the Antarctic to gather data on the activities of the whaling fleets. Their role was to understand the biology, the movements, and the ecology of whales - to appreciate the status of stocks so that the commercial returns could be maximised. It's an awkward feeling knowing that these foetuses were taken from harpooned pregnant humpbacks. Somehow you have to console yourself with the recognition that the acquired data was ultimately what shut down that bloody industry. \"There is a story with every specimen and it may not be a very comfortable story, but it is something we have to acknowledge,\" says Richard. \"The thing to remember is that the data we get from these specimens we actively use for marine conservation purposes now.\" Just this past week, a Swiss-led team used old whaling data to show how species had shrunk in size in the 40 years prior to the stocks collapsing. This trend signal, the team said, could be used to warn of imminent disaster in other hunted wildlife groups. What have we learned from foetuses, specifically? A lot it seems about evolutionary biology. \"One thing we see in these humpbacks is the development of tooth buds at around four-to-five months into gestation. They're then reabsorbed to allow the baleen to start to develop,\" explains Richard. The baleen are the keratin plates that hang from the upper-jaw and filter the humpbacks' prey. \"So, we know from the study of these foetuses, from an evolutionary developmental perspective, that there was a time when all cetaceans were toothed and that baleen are a relatively recent development. And we've only just found the fossils that back that up.\" The whales exhibition is due to open on 14 July, the day after the NHM re-opens its front entrance. The Hintze Hall has been remodelled. Its emblematic diplodocus Dippy dinosaur is being replaced by a blue whale skeleton that will hang from the ceiling (Plot spoiler: I've had a sneak peek already and it looks spectacular). So, it's certainly a timely moment to highlight the contribution of cetaceans to life on Earth. More than 100 specimens from the London museum's collections are being set up in the institution's Waterhouse Gallery. The exhibition will impress upon visitors the huge diversity of whales, dolphins and porpoises. It will explain their relatively short evolutionary journey, from being land animals 50 million years ago to becoming the well-adapted ocean-dwellers we know today. And it will describe how they move, how they breathe, and how some echolocate to find their prey. It still astounds me that whales can communicate over many hundreds of kilometres. \"We want people to realise that as well as being mammals like us, they also have complex culture like us,\" says Richard. \"This is a very new area of study that has accelerated in just the past 10 years through observations, through genetic information and the data coming from museum specimens.\" and follow me on Twitter: BBCAmos",

        "Canadian Roger Thomas Clark is said to have been a key adviser for Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht. The US Department of Justice alleged that Mr Clark advised Ulbricht about the best way to run the site and how to evade the police. The Silk Road website was shut down in late 2013 following raids by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. It was a marketplace sited on the dark web through which many people bought illegal drugs. In May this year Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison for creating and running the site. The DoJ alleges that Mr Clark was a \"high-ranking\" operator on the Silk Road and was instrumental in helping Ulbricht run it. He gave advice about ways to improve the technology underpinning the site, boost sales and on the best way for Ulbricht to hide his real identity, said US authorities. Mr Clark was paid \"at least hundreds of thousands of dollars\" for this advice, said the DoJ in a statement announcing the arrest. \"Clark may have thought residing in Thailand would keep him out of reach of US authorities, but our international partnerships have proven him wrong,\" said FBI assistant director Diego Rodriguez. On the site and in other underground forums, Mr Clark is believed to have used several nicknames including \"Variety Jones, \"VJ,\" \"Cimon\" and \"Plural of Mongoose.\" Extradition proceedings have been started against Mr Clark to transfer him from a jail in Thailand to the US. He faces charges of narcotics conspiracy and money laundering. If found guilty of both charges he could face 30 years in jail.",
        "NFU Scotland said producers were losing about PS10 for every pig that is sold. Prices have been driven down from a record high in 2013 after a Russian import ban led to an oversupply of the meat in Europe. Farming leaders now plan to meet retailers to discuss the promotion of Scottish pork over cheaper rivals. Midlothian pig farmer Robin Traquair said the dramatic price drop could lead to some producers going out of business. \"Farmers are losing money, they are in a cash negative situation, their bank balances are going backwards,\" he said. \"Investment won't be done, they won't become more efficient, people will start to go out of business.\" At its peak, he said he received PS120 for each pig he produced. Now he sells them for about PS85. \"We sell 10,000 pigs a year so it's a big lump of cash,\" he said. \"Now the commodity prices, the cereal prices have come down but it's not come down far enough to cover that.\" Mr Traquair, who owns Wellington Farm, said he was unable to invest in sheds or equipment which would make the business more efficient. He said their choice was either to \"pack in or knuckle down.\" \"At the moment there's some things we should do with spending money on - but we're just going to batten down the hatches and ride it out. It's tough,\" he added. NFU Scotland said that a new processing plant is now operating in Brechin, which could halt the price decline. It plans to meet retailers to discuss \"positioning and publicity\" of Specially Selected Pork, which guarantees high welfare standards as part of Quality Meat Scotland. Kevin Gilbert, NFU Scotland's pigs committee chairman said pig prices had fallen by 18 in the last year. \"Production simply cannot be sustainable at these prices,\" he added. \"It is clear that a lot of cheaper European meat is being substituted for UK product, especially in processed meat products. \"Retailers could really help UK producers at this time by showing greater loyalty to Scottish and UK product. \"This should be a time of positivity for the Scottish pig industry as the new abattoir at Brechin is set to double its processing capacity, allowing more Scottish pigs to be processed in Scotland, which will reduce haulage costs and allow wider stocking of Scottish labelled Specially Selected Pork across the major supermarkets in Scotland.\"",

More on this story and other news from Devon and Cornwall Charlie's parents went to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro on 8 May when Hayley Jermyn was heavily pregnant. The couple were worried the baby would arrive quickly like one of their other children. Mrs Jermyn was assessed by midwife Jane Calvin, who said the mum-to-be was \"not in established labour\" when she examined her five hours after arriving. \"She came in at 22:00 and by the time I got to examine her at 03:00, in all that time nothing had changed,\" she said. Ms Calvin told the inquest there was \"no sign of infection anywhere\" and \"I advised her to go home and get some rest.\" Hours later Charlie was born at home but he died of sepsis on 10 May. Dr Gray said: \"If Charlie had been in hospital at a time when, or soon after, he first showed clinical signs of early-onset sepsis he would have received intravenous antibiotics at least 12 hours, and maybe more than 15 hours, before he died. \"In my opinion, he would, on balance of probability, have survived in such circumstances.\" However, Dr Gray said he it was \"impossible to say\" what condition Charlie might have been left in if he had survived, for example he might have been left with brain damage. He added that the form of Streptococcal infection Charlie had was \"a very serious condition and has a high mortality rate.\" The inquest continues.",
        "Some 65,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh as the military searched for those behind attacks on police border posts. Many of those who fled described rapes, killings and other abuses by the army. But the military said its own investigation found the claims were \"false and fabricated.\" \"Out of 18 accusations included in the [UN human rights body] OHCHR report, 12 were found to be incorrect, with [the] remaining six accusations found to be false and fabricated accusations based on lies and invented statements,\" Myanmar's state media quoted a report from the military as saying. The military said it interviewed 3,000 villagers and 184 military officers and troops. Soldiers were disciplined over two cases, for stealing a motorbike and beating villagers with sticks for failing to put out a fire, the military said. The crackdown began after insurgents killed nine policemen in attacks on border posts between Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, and Bangladesh in Rakhine state. Reports then emerged that the military were targeting Rohingya indiscriminately. The UN report in February - compiled from interviews with those who fled the violence - accused the military of abuses including gang-rapes, savage beatings and murder. It described incidents in which children were killed as their mothers were raped by groups of soldiers, families - including pregnant women and the elderly - being beaten and houses set alight as people sheltered inside. \"The attacks against the Rohingya population in the area.... seem to have been widespread as well as systematic, indicating the very likely commission of crimes against humanity,\" the OHCHR report said. Nobody but the most die-hard supporters of the Burmese military will take this report seriously. The evidence for what United Nations officials are calling \"crimes against humanity\" is overwhelming. Witness testimony from hundreds of Rohingya, satellite images of burnt villages and video of charred bodies to name just a few. And then there's the small matter of explaining why more than 65,000 Rohingya decided to flee their homes and risk their lives crossing the Naf River into Bangladesh. Some of the men have gunshot wounds, scores of women have sought treatment for sexual violence. A smart army response would have acknowledged some failings and promised to address them. Instead the Burmese military is denying everything. How they arrived at that conclusion is unclear. The army investigators say they spoke to more than 3,000 people but they didn't travel to Bangladesh, so haven't heard from any of those who fled and told graphic horror stories to the United Nations. After a period of relative quiet on Rakhine this report once again puts Aung San Suu Kyi in a difficult position. For weeks she's been telling the world that Myanmar doesn't need a United Nations fact-finding mission, and that the Burmese can credibly investigate themselves. This report suggests the exact opposite. Tensions between Rohingya Muslims and Myanmar's Buddhist majority have been rumbling for years. The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar, which views them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. They face routine official and public discrimination. Tens of thousands of Rohingya live in make-shift refugee camps after being displaced by communal violence in 2012. In March, the UN human rights council began an investigation into alleged human rights abuses against Myanmar's Rohingya. It will report back in a year. In April, however, Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi denied there was ethnic cleansing going on, saying using the term was \"too strong.\" She has faced international criticism over her perceived silence on the Rohingya issue.",

Credit to France, they put us under pressure and made us make mistakes. \"We gave too many penalties away, but in the second half we came out and played well but couldn't quite get over the line in the end,\" he told Sky Sports. \"We can't give teams like France and other quality sides head starts like we did. \"We'll look long and hard at ourselves, because we let ourselves down in the first half. We played well in phases but you can't wait for 40 minutes to do that.\" Late tries from Danny Cipriani and Jonathan Joseph made it close on the scoreboard but Lancaster was left with much to ponder by a disappointing team display in the Stade de France. Media playback is not supported on this device The head coach, who must announce his final squad by 31 August, added: \"We've got to get our discipline at the breakdown - we can't give France easy position like we did. We need to improve on that, because all the little mistakes add up. \"The bench made a difference. It upped the energy levels and we scored some good tries. I won't gloss over what went on before that, because it was too little too late. \"There are a few players who have given me food for thought, those guys who came on and gave us the energy we needed and made a difference. \"I need to have a sleep on this game and think about my final squad. We're two weeks away from playing Ireland and four weeks away from Fiji in the World Cup and we'll expect a reaction next time.\" England host Ireland in their final World Cup warm-up game at Twickenham on 5 September. Fly-half Ford told Sky Sports: \"I thought we might snatch that at the end but we had hardly any ball in the first half and gave away too many penalties. We played some good stuff in the second-half. \"In the first half a lot of our undoing was down to ourselves. We just weren't good enough in that first half and there's no excuse for that. We let them build up the score and that made it hard for us. \"It was frustrating and we had to think of ways to adapt and that was constantly going through our minds. We tried to get ourselves out of a hole. \"We've got to turn up against Ireland now and make sure that we win. Our basics have got to be world class.\"",
        "Munster sealed a dramatic late victory against Tandy's side as Dave Kilcoyne touched down to score the winning try. Tandy was frustrated with two incidents from the game where he feels his players were unfairly tackled. \"You just want consistency. That's something we probably didn't get [against Munster],\" he said. Speaking after the defeat, which ended their 13-game unbeaten run in all competitions, he continued: \"There are question marks over the officiating - definitely.\" Tandy was not happy with was what he felt was an illegal no-arms challenge on Ospreys centre Ashley Beck by Francis Saili in the second half. The Ospreys coach was also unhappy where, in the last movement of the game, referee Marius Mitrea again called for TMO Stefano Penne, to adjudicate on a suspected high tackle from Munster replacement hooker Kevin O'Byrne on scrum-half Brendon Leonard. It was not deemed to be a high tackle, however, but Tandy believed it was similar to an incident earlier in the game when prop Rhodri Jones was penalised. \"We'd like some explanation on no-arms tackles and on the consistency of high shots - when you look at Rhodri Jones's in the first half and the ones at the back end of the game,\" he continued. \"You just have to question the protocols and what they are looking at and how far back. They don't want to listen to players when they are asking the question. \"But then they are missing things. I don't even know whether they looked at the no-arm tackle. That would probably be something that's frustrating for us.\" \"At the end of the day it is getting borderline ridiculous when you look at it. But if you are going to be consistent that's something you just want. You could argue both of them are not high tackles, the way the game has gone.\" Despite being unhappy with the refereeing in the game, Tandy admits that his side should have seen the match out and keep the pressure on Munster and Leinster. \"For us, it would be easy to go down the referee route around certain aspects of the game,\" he said. \"But, ultimately, I think there was enough in our game today to win that match.\"",

        "The UN committee on the rights of the child said all children should receive a \"truly inclusive education.\" The committee is composed of 18 members drawn from countries including Bahrain, Spain, Italy and Ethiopia. Their latest report explores how the UK is implementing the UN charter on the rights of the child. However, it includes a number of recommendations specific to Northern Ireland. It says that in Northern Ireland education, \"segregation by religion persists,\" and calls for the executive to \"actively promote a fully integrated education system and carefully monitor the provision of shared education.\" The report goes on to say that abortion should be decriminalised in Northern Ireland \"in all circumstances\" and that the executive should \"review its legislation with a view to ensuring girls' access to safe abortion and post-abortion care services.\" It also recommends that children should be able to decide on their own not to attend religious worship in schools, rather than having to be withdrawn by their parents. Religious education and acts of collective worship are currently compulsory in Northern Ireland schools. Parents do have the option to withdraw their child from these on the grounds of conscience. The CEO of the Integrated Education Fund (IEF), Tina Merron, welcomed the committee's support for integrated education. \"This is a very welcome endorsement of the aims of the integrated education movement and represents recognition at the highest level that young people in Northern Ireland are largely growing up in a context of division and separation according to religious tradition,\" she said. \"I am very pleased to see such a clear expression of support for education reform and would hope that it now becomes central in the new Executive mandate.\" Save the Children NI said another of the report's findings highlighted high levels of child poverty here. \"We hope the NI Executive will take the UN Committee's recommendations seriously and implement them through the new Programme for Government,\" they said.

        "Gayle (75no) and Pollard added 65 off 25 balls as the Windies racked up 205-4, the highest score of the tournament. Despite a defiant 29-ball 63 from captain George Bailey, Australia never recovered from a poor start, crumbling to 131 all out to lose by 74 runs. West Indies will in Colombo on Sunday. It was a phenomenal display from West Indies, based around another exhibition by the peerless Gayle. \"The reason Gayle is so good is that normally a batsman puts the bad ball away for four, but Gayle doesn't even have to hit the ball cleanly and it goes for six. He's so powerful, the grounds aren't big enough for him.\" Despite facing only 41 balls in the 20-over innings and requiring treatment midway through for a side strain, the left-handed opener still managed to get within 25 runs of a century, smashing six sixes and five fours with a strike rate of 182. Marlon Samuels helped set the tempo with a breezy 26 and Dwayne Bravo hit three towering sixes in his 37 off 31 balls. However, it was Gayle and Pollard, who plundered 63 runs off the last four overs, who really demoralised Australia. After watching the previously economical Mitchell Starc carted for 17 in the penultimate over, Bailey took a gamble by throwing the ball to left-arm spinner Xavier Doherty. It proved a costly mistake as Gayle heaved a six over midwicket before Pollard helped himself to three maximums in a row. He holed out at long-off off the last ball of the innings to fall for 38 off 15 deliveries, but the damage had been done. Australia's best chance of joining their women's team in the final by completing the joint second highest successful run chase in the tournament's history was always likely to lie with prolific openers David Warner and Shane Watson. 16 - Chris Gayle (West Indies) 15 - Shane Watson (Australia) 13 - Luke Wright (England) 10 - Brendon McCullum (New Zealand 9 - Marlon Samuels (West Indies) So when both were bowled by leg-spinner Samuel Badree inside the first five overs, the writing was on the wall. Warner was dismissed off the last ball of the first over when a television replay confirmed that a googly had shaved his off stump. After Mike Hussey top-edged a return catch to Marlon Samuels following a rapid 18, Watson was castled for seven by one that fizzed on. Ravi Rampaul took two wickets in three balls - Cameron White caught down the leg side and David Hussey caught and bowled off a leading edge - before Matthew Wade was caught sweeping to leave Australia reeling on 43-6. Bailey, not renowned for his ball-striking, led a one-man counter-attack, but with the required run-rate creeping above 14 per over, his innings was nothing more than a footnote to proceedings. So it proved as Pollard removed Pat Cummins and Bailey in the same over, Brad Hogg was stumped off Sunil Narine and Rampaul bowled Starc to wrap up a phenomenal win. The Windies are through to their first global final since 2004, when they beat England at The Oval to win the Champions Trophy. Tthey will face a severe test against Sri Lanka, who, in Lasith Malinga and Ajantha Mendis, have two of the most successful bowlers at the tournament, and will be cheered on by a raucous home crowd.",
        "Schalk Burger and JP Pietersen crashed over in a first half dominated by the powerful Springboks. The Scots struggled to make inroads until a Duncan Weir interception led to a thrilling Tommy Seymour try. But the cool kicking of Handre Pollard kept South Africa at a safe distance and Bryan Habana added a late score to reflect the gulf in quality. Listen to the best of the action on BBC Radio 5 live The Springboks, twice World Cup winners, signalled that their campaign is back on track with a bludgeoning display of brute force after their shock opening loss to Japan. Scotland now look ahead to next weekend's clash with Samoa, knowing victory will see them through to the quarter-finals. The first score came after 13 minutes when a combination of Burger, Bismarck du Plessis and Duane Vermeulen smashed their way through the Scottish defence, with Burger credited with the final touch in a muddle of hands. Scotland were warned and here was the Springbok maul in all its ferocity. At times the Scots were mauled off the park, never more so than at the end of a one-sided first half when a devastating rumble paved the way for JP Pietersen to touch down. It was textbook. It came with Jannie du Plessis in the sin-bin. Scotland were in a mightily deep hole. At the break, such was South Africa's upper hand that you felt Scotland were set for a pummelling, with Heyneke Meyer's team leading by a handsome 17 points. The revival from Scotland might have been brief but it was heartening. Weir's epic breakaway and the support from Tim Visser created a try from the blue from Seymour to cut the game to a seven-point margin. It was a score that rocked the Bokke but just when Scotland needed to consolidate, they blundered. They made a frightful hash of the restart, then had Greig Laidlaw sent to the bin for a cynical grab at Habana. Their bravery never let up one for second, though. A sure sign of South Africa's concerned mindset came when Pollard opted for a drop goal to re-establish their cushion. In the end, the Boks had too much ball and too much power. The physical toll was massive. South Africa did not play cosmic rugby but they played with an intensity that Scotland could not live with. A do-or-die meeting with the Samoans, who suffered a major loss to Japan. Samoa are out of the World Cup. if Scotland beat them, they make the quarter-finals. Next Saturday back at St James' Park will be huge for the Scots. Vern Cotter has some decisions to make. Blair Cowan was magnificent and made a mockery of the decision to leave him out of the original 31. If John Hardie is fit, who plays seven next week? Cotter will be encouraged by some of what he saw. The courage was there in spades against South Africa. Richie Gray was wonderful. His younger brother, Jonny, was not far behind. Josh Strauss showed up well. This was a beaten Scotland but a Scotland that is improving and will be considered hot favourites in the must-win game on Saturday - their biggest test in four years. Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw: \"We were disappointed with our performance. It was a poor first half, probably wasn't a great second half either, we just didn't really get out the blocks and paid the price for it. \"We knew [the South African physicality] was coming, we just didn't stop it. We were letting them get that momentum we spoke about. Once they did that it was a nightmare to try and attack. \"The breakdown was a melee; we let them get on the front foot when they were attacking so it was hard to defend. \"That was all nonsense [about Scotland fielding a weakened side] before the game; we're just disappointed with our performance.\" South Africa: le Roux, Pietersen, Kriel, de Allende, Habana, Pollard, du Preez, Mtawarira, B. du Plessis, J. du Plessis, Etzebeth, de Jager, Louw, Burger, Vermeulen.

        "Nationalist MPs will take control of the UK Parliament's energy and climate change select committee and Scottish affairs select committee. The SNP won 56 of the 59 Westminster constituencies at the general election two weeks ago. That resulted in the party being the third largest, behind the Conservatives and Labour. Parliamentary convention dictates that the official third largest party at Westminster gets to chair a number of select committees. SNP chief whip Mike Weir said both committees were especially important to Scotland in this parliament. He said: \"We will be seeing one of the major bills coming forward in the Scotland Bill on more powers for Scotland, and of course the energy and climate change committee is of particular importance with our oil and gas sector and renewables industry. \"The SNP chairing these committees will allow us to make progress on these important issues, and will help us get the best deal for Scotland.\"",
        "On 17 December 2014, President Obama and President Raul Castro announced the historic decision to put decades of Cold War hostility behind them and re-establish long-frozen diplomatic ties. The move caught most people by surprise. But one of the few who knew it was coming was the US Charge d'Affaires in Havana, ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis. \"It was just an extraordinary day, as you might imagine,\" says ambassador DeLaurentis. \"I spent the very early part of the morning seeing off Alan Gross,\" he says in reference to a prisoner swap that saw a USAID sub-contractor in a Cuban prison on espionage charges exchanged for three Cuban intelligence agents in jail in the US. He then gathered his staff at the US Interests Section to tell them of the detente. \"Everyone erupted into thunderous applause and at that moment I knew that we were on a whole new journey. You could just feel the sea change.\" There was little time to dwell on the news or celebrate. By January, a high-level diplomatic mission from Washington was in Havana for the first of several rounds of talks towards normalising ties. There were some thorny issues on the table, as well as some initial practical difficulties. \"We hadn't had this sort of negotiation in over 50 years so we obviously had to develop a certain level of trust and confidence,\" recalls the ambassador. The Cubans raised their key questions, including the future of the Guantanamo naval base, the US economic embargo on the island and the inclusion of Cuba on a US list of state sponsors of terror. The State Department soon removed Cuba from that list and by July, both sides were ready to restore full diplomatic relations. Did Washington's top diplomat to Cuba ever think that it might not happen? \"No. I don't mean to imply that the issues we had to work through were easy because they weren't,\" he told the BBC. \"But frankly I never doubted that we would get to the point we did in July.\" Less than a month later, John Kerry became the first Secretary of State to visit Cuba since 1945 and reopened the embassy. Ambassador DeLaurentis picks out the presence of the three marines who had lowered the flag in 1961 as a particular highlight. He also recalls the mixture of Americans, Cubans and Cuban-Americans in the audience as he stood at the podium. \"At that point I realised that what we were really talking about here was reconciliation - that's pretty dramatic in my business,\" he adds with a wry smile. Since the thaw was announced, there has been a subsequent rise in immigration to the US, often via Ecuador, and from there overland to the US border with Mexico. Many Cubans hoping to flee to the US are fearful that special immigration privileges they receive as Cubans - under the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy and the Cuban Adjustment Act - will soon disappear now that the two nations are becoming friends. I put it to the ambassador that many would-be migrants now see this as a race against time. \"We have no plans to change our migration policy and that's the message the Cuban people need to hear and absorb,\" he told me. That may be Washington's message, but many Cubans simply aren't hearing it. Around 4,500 Cuban migrants are stranded in Costa Rica amid a stand-off with Nicaragua over their route north. Meanwhile Ecuador has reinstated a rule requiring all Cubans to obtain a visa to visit and doctors have been told they need special permission to leave the island. An apparent crackdown on outward migration in the wake of the thaw has begun. That this year has been significant at a diplomatic level is in little doubt. But the key obstacle to \"normal\" bilateral relations, the lifting of the US economic embargo on Cuba, still hasn't happened. The US Congress is the only body which can take that decision. President Obama has urged them to do so but some members of Congress want Cuba to take steps over human rights first. As a result, there are no more products on the supermarket shelves in Cuba than there were before last December's announcement and most people say their monthly incomes haven't improved either. 2011: 2.1 (Latin American average: 4.7) 2012: 2.1 (2.9) 2013: 2.1 (2.7) 2014: 2.1 (0.9) 2015 Forecast: 2.1 (0.4) 2016 Forecast: 2.1 (2.0) Source: World Bank Little wonder many ordinary Cubans say the new diplomatic relationship has made little difference to their lives so far. \"What I've heard is a lot of hope. Maybe some of it was initially unrealistic in terms of the pace,\" admits the ambassador. \"But I think overall people are hopeful. Even after all these years there remains a reservoir of goodwill towards the United States.\" Asked if he thought the embargo's days were numbered, though, he took a typically diplomatic position: \"It's very hard to say.\" Within the year, there will be another president in the White House. Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Donald Trump, among others, have opposed the move to re-establish diplomatic ties. The US broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961 after Fidel Castro and his brother Raul led a revolution toppling US-backed President Fulgencio Batista. The Castros established a revolutionary socialist state with close ties to the Soviet Union. The following year, the US imposed a trade embargo covering nearly all exports to Cuba. This was expanded by President Kennedy into a full economic embargo that included stringent travel restrictions. The embargo is estimated to have cost the Cuban economy more than 1.1tn and the US economy 1.2bn a year. In September, the US announced eased restrictions on business and travel with Cuba, the latest move by President Barack Obama to improve relations with the country. US businesses will now be allowed to open up locations in Cuba. But the ambassador wouldn't be drawn on the race for the presidency. \"It's my hope that when whoever is elected president enters the White House, he or she will make the determination that this was the right course because it's in the best interests of the United States,\" he says. Maybe so, but others fear that the hard work put in to rebuild mutual trust could be easily undone. A visit by President Obama to Cuba before he leaves office would certainly help cement the new relationship. Again the Charge d'Affaires in Havana was reluctant to comment too far: \"Any president who's taken this historic step to change dramatically a bilateral relationship I imagine would contemplate (a visit).\" If so, 2016 could be even bigger in Cuba than last year.",

        "Over the same period Scotland housed 249 Syrian refugees and Northern Ireland 104, Home Office figures show. Nine of Wales' 22 councils had taken part in the Syrian refugee settlement programme up to the end of June, four more than three months earlier. Oxfam Cymru welcomed the increase but said the resettlement process remained \"painfully slow\" in Wales. UK ministers have pledged to settle 20,000 Syrians in the UK by 2020 under a scheme launched in October 2015. Between April and June Rhondda Cynon Taf resettled 18 refugees whilst Blaenau Gwent, Carmarthenshire and the Vale of Glamorgan took five each, as the four councils took part in the Home Office-funded scheme for the first time.

Other local authorities, including Wrexham and Anglesey, also have plans to accommodate refugees fleeing war-torn Syria. Matthew Hemsley from Oxfam Cymru said: \"We welcome the fact that more families have been brought to safety here and we know that more refugees from Syria have arrived over the summer. \"Yet we cannot ignore how painfully slow the resettlement process still is in Wales. \"While there is some improvement in terms of numbers resettled here, there is no doubt that Wales still could and should do more to help families who have seen their lives torn apart by this war.\" Mr Hemsley urged the Welsh Government and councils to work closely together to speed up the system.",
        "This is despite the company reporting a pre-tax profit of PS36m in the first half of 2015, compared with a loss of PS9m a year earlier. The group said the turnaround was due to \"robust trading\" in its food and funeral businesses. These are the first results since radical changes to the business were brought in at the end of last year. Following a review of the business by Lord Myners, the number of board members was cut drastically, while directors had to have qualifications suited to running the business. Members were also given one vote each. The business recorded a deficit of PS2.5bn in 2013 following massive losses at the Co-operative Bank. Following changes in the ownership structure of the bank, the Co-op Group now holds just a 20 stake in the bank. \"We've made a good start on the three year journey to rebuild the Co-operative Group,\" said chief executive Richard Pennycook of the half-year results. \"These early days are about fixing the basics - putting in place new leadership teams and providing the investment to deliver the strategies for our businesses.

The suspect fled with a four-figure sum of cash, cigarettes and the wallet and mobile of a 61-year-old customer who came into the shop and intervened. Police described it as a \"shocking\" and \"vicious\" attack. The suspect was described as white, in his early 20s, wearing black trousers, a black top, light pink trainers and a black scarf covering his face. He was also carrying a black backpack which may have had pink markings on it. Det Con Andrew Hope said: \"This was a shocking attack. It was vicious and the member of staff sustained a serious head injury during the attack. \"He was taken by ambulance to the Borders General Hospital where he was treated and has since been released. \"The suspect had no thought for the staff member or the customer who thankfully was not injured in the incident. \"The Post Office is a busy place, as is Gala Park where the suspect made off towards, so I would appeal to anyone who saw the attack and who hasn't already spoken to police, or anyone who can assist officers with their inquiries to contact us.\"",

        "The key moment was a fumble by Mayo keeper Robert Hennelly early in the second half which gifted Dublin a penalty scored by Diarmuid Connolly. Hennelly was a late inclusion in place of David Clarke but the move backfired. Deep in injury-time, Cillian O'Connor missed a difficult free which would have levelled the scores. Lee Keegan's goal put Mayo ahead midway through the first period but Dublin regrouped to lead 0-10 to 1-6 by half-time. Hennelly struggled badly with his kick-outs early on with one of his misdirected clearances leading to the black carding of the influential Keegan late in the first half in what was a huge blow for the Connacht county. Earlier, Dublin's Jonny Cooper was also black carded and a number other players from both sides - notably Dublin's John Small - were fortunate not to suffer the same fate. In the end, Dublin's stronger bench proved decisive as Cormac Costello came on to kick the champions' three final scores from play. Cillian O'Connor's ninth point of the contest left the minimum between the teams with three minutes of injury-time left but the Mayo free-taker then missed a high-pressure free from 40 metres which would have levelled the scores again. As Dublin celebrated back-to-back titles for the first time since the county's triumphs in 1976 and'77, Mayo's players looked crestfallen as they attempted to come to terms with a fifth All-Ireland final defeat in 12 years. With Hennelly struggling to pick out team-mates from his kick-outs, Dublin moved into a 0-4 to 0-0 lead by the sixth minute which included three Dean Rock points - two of which were from play. But Mayo were on terms within six minutes after a run of four points started by Patrick Durcan's superb point. Two Rock frees edged Dublin ahead again but Mayo were suddenly in the lead as the over-lapping Keegan took a perfectly weighted pass from Aidan O'Shea before hammering past Stephen Cluxton from 14 yards. Cooper's black carding moments later for a hand trip appeared a further boost for Mayo but the Dubs outscored them 0-4 to 0-2 during the remainder of the first period to lead 0-10 to 1-6 at the break. Mayo regained the lead within two minutes of the restart but were soon three in arrears after another Rock free was followed by Hennelly's howler as he was forced to concede a penalty after spilling a harmless looking ball, with his inevitable black carding followed by Connolly superbly stroking past Clarke. Mayo cut Dublin's lead to the minimum on four occasions during the remaining half hour of action but their habitual woes of errant shooting and a lack of composure prevented them from getting on terms. Once again, Aidan O'Shea was not the force that Mayo would have hoped for despite his good work for their first-half goal. Mayo: R Hennelly, B Harrison, D Vaughan, K Higgins, L Keegan, C Boyle, P Durcan, S O'Shea, T Parsons, K McLoughlin, A O'Shea, D O'Connor, J Doherty. A Moran, C O'Connor.

        "The local authority has spent more than PS750,000 on events since 2014. In total, 18 different organisations have received support for 38 events which attracted combined attendances of more than 160,000 people. The council report added that more than 43 of audiences had come from outside Dumfries and Galloway. The study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the local authority's Major Festivals and Events Strategy (MFES). Among the events it has supported are Wigtown Book Festival, Spring Fling and the Dumfries and Galloway Arts Festival. A survey found there was good public awareness of the strategy, with 85 of respondents saying the events benefited their community. The majority also said it had helped to provide a \"favourable impression\" of the council. The review concluded that the strategy had \"generally met its objectives\" in terms of supporting the development of the events sector in Dumfries and Galloway. \"The region is increasingly recognised for the breadth and depth of events across a number of sectors staged within its borders each year,\" it said. \"These contribute significantly to the regional economy as well as to the quality of life of our population.\" However, the study did flag up concerns about policing costs at some music festivals in the region. A meeting is to be held at the end of the month to try to tackle the issue.",
        "A stretch of the 100ft (30m) -high cliff in East Cliff, close to the memorial for Red Arrows pilot Jon Egging, fell away on Sunday morning, taking fencing and benches with it. No-one was injured but the area has been cordoned off by the council amid concerns of further movement. The seafront promenade remains open. The East Cliff Lift, an Edwardian funicular railway built in 1908 and operated by Bournemouth Borough Council, was partially submerged by debris, while a public toilet block at the foot of the cliffs was destroyed. Cracks started appearing on the promenade on Saturday, leading the council to close off the areas at the top and bottom of the cliff. Councillor Lawrence Williams said barriers were expected to be in place \"for the foreseeable future.\" \"Although this is a significant landslip, it is only one spot along Bournemouth's seven miles of beaches and we do not have any concerns about other areas,\" he added. Chris Saunders, head of operations at the council, said: \"If there is more rainfall over the next couple of the days then there is likely to be more movement although we expect it to be minor.\" He said the council was waiting for experts to visit the site and assess the damage. A sculpture at the top of the cliff - a memorial to Flt Lt Jon Egging who died when his Hawk T1 aircraft crashed at the 2011 Bournemouth Air Festival - has not been damaged, a spokeswoman for the Jon Egging Trust said. East Overcliff Drive at the top of the cliff remains open, as does the Bournemouth Carlton hotel. The hotel has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.",
        "The Night Wolves had planned to enter next week as part of a ride across Europe to commemorate the 70th anniversary of World War Two. Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz had called the plan a \"provocation.\" The Night Wolves' vice-president, Felix Chernyakhovsky, has insisted the bikers still intend to make the trip. \"Everything remains the same. We're starting tomorrow as planned,\" he told Interfax news agency. The Night Wolves are subject to US sanctions for alleged active involvement in Crimea and for helping to recruit separatist fighters for Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. Russia's foreign ministry said it was \"outraged\" at Poland's decision. The Night Wolves' planned road trip through Poland stirred such controversy because of the group's close association with Vladimir Putin and its support of Moscow's annexation of Crimea and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. They are viewed in Poland as the \"Kremlin's Hells Angels.\" The day after news of the trip appeared earlier this month many Polish newspapers illustrated the story with a photograph showing a sunglass-wearing, helmetless Russian president riding an enormous three-wheeled Harley-Davidson Lehman Trike with the club in Crimea in 2010. A Facebook page entitled \"No to the Russian bandits' ride through Poland\" quickly garnered support from more than 10,000 people. The page's co-host Jarek Podworski, a biker from Krakow, told me the Night Wolves were not motorcycle enthusiasts but criminals, some of whom had taken part in the fighting in eastern Ukraine. Besides, he added, Poles remembered the Soviet occupation of Poland. Warsaw has been a strong critic of Moscow's actions in Ukraine. The Polish foreign ministry said three other Russian biker groups would be allowed into the country. But it said it was notified of the group's plans only on Monday, and without details of the route or number of participants. The ministry added that it had informed the Russian embassy in Warsaw that the lack of information meant \"it could not ensure proper security for the participants.\" However, Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement: \"It is clear that the decision that was taken has a political motive.\" The Night Wolves intend to cross several countries, following a path taken by the Red Army in World War Two, with the aim of arriving in Berlin in time for 9 May Victory Day celebrations in Moscow. The 6,000km (3,720 mile) road trip would take them through Russia, Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, before reaching Germany.",
        "Heydrich - one of the architects of the Final Solution when he was governor of occupied Bohemia - was assassinated by British-trained Czech and Slovak troops in May 1942. It was an operation which was so audacious in its planning and execution that it inspired John Martin from Mold, Flintshire, to research the topic for more than 40 years. He interviewed Heydrich's son, and descendants of the Special Operations Executive hit-team which killed him, as part of a book which has now been made into a film. Anthropoid, named after the mission's codename, has just gone on general release. It stars actors Cillian Murphy and Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan who portrays a Czech resistance fighter. Mr Martin, who is an extra in the film, said: \"Not many people have heard of Anthropoid, partly because it was earlier on in the war, and partly because afterwards Britain's role was played down by the Soviets. \"It took me until after the fall of the Iron Curtain to be able to get into Prague and properly investigate what happened.\" Born in 1904, Reinhard Heydrich was a decorated German naval officer in the Weimar Republic. During the rise of the Nazis he progressed quickly to head several branches of the Nazi secret police, including the Gestapo and SD, and was a key figure in both'The Night of The Long Knives' and'Kristallnacht'. As Nazi head in occupied Czechoslovakia, he was instructed to improve the productivity of the region's flagging munitions and automobile factories. It was a role which he performed so successfully that the Allies determined he must be removed. Mr Martin said: \"Before Heydrich's appointment the Czech Resistance had been quite successful in reducing productivity by as much as a third through go-slows. \"Heydrich introduced a policy he called'Sugar and Whip', whereby those who cooperated gained extra rations and clothing, whilst those who didn't were kidnapped, tortured and killed. \"In one way the fact he rewarded people might be seen as a humanising feature, but I think it makes him all the more chilling. \"For him, it wasn't about the violence, he'd do whatever it took to achieve the Nazis' ultimate ambitions.\" In December 1941 the SOE assassination squad of Josef Gabcik and Jan Kubis was parachuted into Bohemia from an RAF Halifax bomber. They spent six months undercover planning their assault, before finally ambushing Heydrich on a blind hairpin bend on the Prague to Dresden road on 27 May 1942. Heydrich died of his injuries a week later, and although the Nazis reaped devastating revenge, Mr Martin contends it was still a worthwhile mission. Mr Martin said: \"Hitler personally ordered the levelling of two villages - Lidice and Lezaky - where all the men over 16 were shot and all the women transported to concentration camps. \"The ordinary population paid a terrible price for what was essentially an economic and military attack. Yet you can see in Hitler's response just what a devastating blow the assassination was. \"Hitler was furious at the arrogance which led Heydrich to travel in an unguarded open top car, and later he'd say that the loss of Heydrich was the beginning of the end in the battle for the Eastern Front.\" Mr Martin currently works on cruise ships, where he gives both comedy performances and history lectures on Heydrich. \"It's a strange life for me,\" he said. \"One night I'll be telling jokes, and the next afternoon I'm lecturing on the holocaust. \"Some comedians can make jokes about things like that, but I have to keep the two completely separate. \"I'm delighted that my book's been made into a film. I can tell people about Heydrich, but it's only now they'll see him on the screen, that his true horror will really sink in.\"",

        "Special Report: The Technology of Business The workplaces that build Africa's future Is teleworking driving us crazy? The tech getting disabled people into work Recruitment robots need impressing Is technology killing the lure of company heritage? If you're not at work catching up when you think the boss isn't looking, you're quite likely to be on the sofa in front of the television. If so then you're not alone. According to research by Nielsen 88 of US tablet owners use them while watching TV at least once a month, with 45 using them several times a day. In the UK, that figure is 80, with 24 using it daily. These countries may be at the top of the list - but the figures point to a growing trend. Rather than resign themselves to audiences watching with half an eye, while posting pictures of kittens on Facebook, broadcasters are looking for ways to harness this trend to keep viewers engaged. No verifiable eyeballs on your content leads to dwindling advertising income. At IBC, the annual gathering of the broadcast industry in Amsterdam, the rise of the second screen, or companion device (that's a tablet or smartphone to you and me) was the topic of the moment. If the idea of a coming zombie apocalypse keeps you up at night, you may have found yourself watching The Walking Dead for tips. So many of us tuned in that its broadcaster, FX UK, decided to create a companion app for series two that would appeal to viewers, but that would keep those precious eyeballs glued to the screen during the important bits. \"It was fascinating to tie [the app] with the idea of gamification with that particular programme, with that fanbase, which seemed to make sense,\" says Steve Plunkett, chief technology officer at broadcast technology and service provider Red Bee. \"But we had no idea how it was going to play out with the public. So we were delighted to see the take-up rates which were great.\" As well as being popular with audiences, it has also won an IBC innovation award. A bit like Cluedo for the undead, the app lets you predict how many zombies will bite the dust during each episode, who will despatch them, and the most common weapon of choice. As each member of the undead hordes meets their maker, the app notes the kill, who was responsible and how they did it. At the end of the episode viewers discover how close they got, and can then share the results on Facebook and Twitter. \"What's interesting is that we can now accurately tie together the two screens,\" says Mr Plunkett. \"We knew exactly what episode you were watching, you just switched on and it figured everything out, and knew exactly where you were in the programme.\" It uses technology known as audio watermarking, which lets the app work whether you watch live, time-shifted or recorded on your DVR. Tiny chunks of data that are inaudible to humans are embedded in the soundtrack of the show. The device running the app then \"listens\" as the episode starts, works out which one you are watching and synchronises with it. For content where it's not possible or practical to embed data, audio fingerprinting can be used, where specific audio triggers the synchronisation of an app. For devices that don't have microphones, signals sent via the internet can also be used. Another show with a cult following that has its own companion app is US biker gang saga Sons of Anarchy. The app has evolved over two seasons, according to Magic Ruby's Robert Gekchyan. In our proof of concept app] you see a character you like, you want his hat, you want his jacket. They had all the items already on the website, but by presenting it on this app they really saw a huge uptake of sales. \"This year we have a full application that has trivia that gets people really engaged in the show, exclusive on-set photos and some of the writers on the show have contributed to the content in the application.\" The app also synchronises with each episode, letting viewers track the conversation about episodes on social media - regardless of when they're watching. \"We built something called the social timeline so you can actually follow the show through tweets that are happening as things happen specifically in the show. \"This really works well in times-shifted environments - different time zones, catch-up TV situations where you still want to follow along the conversation.\" The next step for Magic Ruby is looking at new ways of making money from these apps. \"It would probably be difficult to do the traditional or banner advertising in this space,\" he says. \"So it's how do we get advertisers to do interactive advertising, get involved in the show, it's not just your watching the show and this car commercial that has zero context comes up.\" John Stoneman of mobile advertising specialists InMobi agrees. \"For it to be effective, it needs to be complementary to the user's experience and not obtrusive.... and that's one of the great things about the second screen. The consumer has the option to engage if they want to, but it's not forcing them to sit through something they don't want.\" Mr Stoneman believes broadcasters need to come to terms with second screen devices, and how they're being used. The chief executive of online video platform Brightcove, Jeremy Allaire, believes there's a more radical shift taking place. The company recently launched their app creation platform AppCloud, aimed at letting broadcasters and other content creators build companion apps. \"In my mind I think that the current effort is sort of a band-aid or a hack, and the real opportunity is when the full content experience and the applications that interact with that content are all delivered over the internet to tablets or smart TVs.\" he says. The company is also creating full screen TV apps aimed at content far beyond regular programming. \"Dual screen TV apps are about really using the TV set as the second screen. \"The tablet becomes the primary screen you interact with, you make choices on, and discover on and the large display is where you have rich media and consume content and information.\" Perhaps unsurprisingly he has strong views on the future of television. \"Linear television is not going to be saved by companion second-screen applications, that's for sure. I think you know more likely 90 of the content that's on linear television should really just be content that's published on demand.\" Not everyone agrees. Magic Ruby's Robert Gekchyan sees things differently. \"I think people still love TV, they love the content, and now they can have the interactivity and the interactivity with their friends. \"You're by yourself on the couch and you're watching with multiple people. It's perfect for live events, for sports, for reality shows, water-cooler-type TV shows.\" No knows what lies ahead - but maybe there's room for something in between. One of the most popular demonstrations at IBC is broadcast software experts NDS' video wall. In their conception of the future the walls of our home become a giant television screen, that integrates with the wallpaper. Content selection is done from a tablet device, and is \"thrown\" to the wall you want to view it on. This can be anything from movies, television, radio, social media and news to the family calendar, the view from your nannycam, or family photos and videos. It can be any size you want, with as much or as little content on display. Audio is directional, and advertising and other broadcast furniture can be arranged around the picture, leaving the image clean. At the moment screen technology means the bevels are clearly visible between panels. But it doesn't take much imagination to picture technology like Sony's new 4k ultra-high definition television, also on show at the exhibition, or NHK's 8k super hi vision, or even Dolby's glasses-free 3D making the experience even more immersive. Whatever the future holds, one thing is clear. As a species we are likely to become ever more addicted to vast amounts of content - wherever it comes from. As long as the zombies don't get us first...",
        "It does not include a final decision about where to locate a new station in or near Sheffield. The announcement confirms ministers' commitment to push ahead with the controversial PS56bn project, which they say will boost the economy. Critics say HS2 is not needed and will spoil parts of the countryside. The announcement removes much of the uncertainty over the project, except over where to site Sheffield's station - a decision on which is expected next year. The government's preferred option is for the main HS2 route to run east of Sheffield, with a separate spur to take passengers to Sheffield city centre. This would cost around PS1bn less than the alternative suggestions - which involved taking the main HS2 line through Sheffield city centre or to a new station at the Meadowhall shopping centre just outside Sheffield, near the M1. Another spur will take HS2 to a new station at Manchester airport. The first phase of the PS56bn railway is due to open in December 2026, with trains to travel at high speed between London and Birmingham before continuing on the existing West Coast Main Line. The second, Y-shaped phase is due to be completed by about 2032-33. Now that the government has confirmed most of its chosen route, it will go through the parliamentary process. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said support and compensation would be available to those affected by the project, who can begin the process now by contacting HS2 Ltd. The Department for Transport says compensation will be calculated at 110 of the value their home would have had without any plans for HS2. Anyone living within 60m of the route is entitled to compensation, although the DfT said that could be extended in certain circumstances and wasn't \"a hard and fast rule.\" Nevertheless, communities along the proposed route in South Yorkshire are still voicing strong objections. Among them are residents of the newly built Shimmer Estate in Mexborough, which is likely to be demolished to make way for the new rail line. Resident Russell Holmes said: \"It may be a new estate, but it's a proper community. For that to be destroyed is devastating. \"But the uncertainty, waiting until it happens, when you can actually put something in place to move, is horrible as well.\" The area's MP, former Labour leader Ed Miliband, said he would oppose the planned Sheffield part of the route, saying it \"flies in the face of evidence, logic, value for money and the needs and interests of local people.\" He added: \"This is the wrong decision for South Yorkshire, wrong for Doncaster and wrong for the residents who will see their homes destroyed and communities blighted.\" Jonathan Pile, of campaign group Yorkshire Against HS2, said the proposed route was \"unsuitable, should be struck out\" and was \"unfit for purpose.\" Pressure group Stop HS2 said that once the high-speed railway was operating, existing intercity services to London would be reduced by up to two trains an hour. The group's campaign manager, Joe Rukin, said ministers were \"trying to con the public\" that the high-speed line was needed to boost rail capacity. \"The government have finally come clean in admitting'freeing up capacity' means for many cities'losing the trains you already have', as the HS2 business case demands PS8.3bn worth of cuts to existing services,\" he added.",
        "Doors to the event at Glasgow Green will open at 14:00. TRNSMT is being held on what was traditionally the weekend of the T in the Park festival, which is not taking place this year. Other bands appearing over the weekend include include Kasabian, Biffy Clyro and The Kooks. The acts will play across three stages at Scotland's newest music festival, with highlights being broadcast every evening on a BBC Scotland programme presented by Edith Bowman. Radiohead will headline the opening night, with Kasabian headlining on Saturday and Biffy Clyro closing the festival on Sunday. Organisers DF Concerts announced TRNSMT in January, two months after saying it was suspending T in the Park to \"take stock\" of a challenging two years since the festival moved to Strathallan from Balado. The promoter said \"continued restrictions\" had had a \"negative impact\" on festival-goers. T in the Park's first year at Strathallan in 2015 was plagued by traffic problems.

Officers also warned there would be a zero-tolerance approach to drug-taking and anyone found with illegal substances would be arrested. Flares, smoke devices and other pyrotechnics are banned from the festival area and anyone who is drunk will not be allowed entry.",
        "The Louisiana governor, a likely contender for his party's presidential nomination in 2016, said a number of Republicans had \"damaged the brand\" by making \"offensive and bizarre\" comments. He's talking of course about those remarks about \"legitimate rape\" and how rape can't lead to pregnancy. The Republicans who made those comments did seem to be going out of their way to back up John Stuart Mill's 1866 comment: \"I never meant to say that the Conservatives are generally stupid. I meant to say that stupid people are generally Conservative. I believe that is so obviously and universally admitted a principle that I hardly think any gentleman will deny it.\" OK. That's the headline grabber. But it is hardly a revelation to point out that those who make weird noises during an election campaign should shut up. So it is worth looking at Gov Jindal's prescription in full. It is, after all, among the first contributions from a big name of the Republican party on how not to go down to defeat for a third time in a row. He's adamant the party shouldn't change its principles. Not on taxation or big government, of course. But not on abortion or gay marriage either. He rejects Mr Romney's apparent contention that 47 of voters were out of reach for Republicans, which was always, when you think about it, a counsel of despair. Gov Jindal identifies a core Republican problem: they are overwhelmingly white in a country that is becoming more of a melting pot day by day. \"We must reject the notion that demography is destiny, the pathetic and simplistic notion that skin pigmentation dictates voter behaviour,\" he said. He's a good person to say this. His parents came to the US from India in 1970. It says a lot about the way America has changed that he has become the governor of a state that resisted civil rights and defended segregation to the bitter end. I don't want to underplay how important that is - but his speech doesn't say how Republicans can reach the fastest growing ethnic group - Latinos - without shifting their stance on immigration reform. Moreover, I am puzzled by what appears to be the core of his message. He rejects big government - but also seems to reject the fights about it in Washington. He calls not only the debates about gun control, but also those on the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling \"sideshows.\" \"These are in reality sideshows in Washington that we have allowed to take centre stage in our country - and as conservatives, we are falling into the sideshow trap,\" he said. This is not an isolated point. \"We seem to have an obsession with government bookkeeping,\" he says. \"We as Republicans have to accept that government number crunching - even conservative number crunching - is not the answer to our nation's problems.\" Of course he's underscoring an inherent irony in conservatism - those politicians who dislike government put all their time and effort and will and money into becoming part of the government, so they can do away with much of it. Inevitably, they rather like being part of it, and stick around for years trying to slim down something they disapprove of, fanatical dieters insisting on eating at the best restaurants so they can better control the portion sizes. It is an irony, in that one can chuckle about it, but it is not a paradox. It is, I would have thought, pretty essential for conservatives who want to control government spending to have control of that government. His argument seems to be that Republicans should spend their time encouraging the \"real economy\" and leaving it up to the states to spend what little public money he deems necessary. Maybe this is merely a coded attack on those Republicans in the House of Representatives, who seem to think they won the election. If he is identifying them as a major part of the party's image problem, he is right, but he's not pointing a way out of their complex dilemma - the choice between being quislings to faithful Republicans or obstructionists in the mind of most Americans. So an \"A\" for effort, grabbing headlines, and identifying the obvious, but a \"C\" for a rather confused economic approach, which looks more like a desire to say something jolting than a serious contribution. I'm looking forward to hearing Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and, even more, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, describe the way ahead. But Gov Jindal has made a start confronting his shocked, and rather complacent, party.",

He knows he should have been more careful with the milk.\" Price was told to pay PS1.50 compensation to Tesco, fined PS75, ordered to pay PS20 victim surcharge and PS85 costs. The money will be deducted from his benefits at PS10 a fortnight.",
        "Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridgeshire, run by Circle, was branded \"inadequate\" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) last month. However, its chief executive, Hisham Abdel-Rahman, said the report was \"problematic\" and full of errors. The CQC accepted some mistakes but said it stood by the report. Mr Abdel-Rahman was giving evidence to the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee on Monday. Circle announced on 9 January that it was in talks to ensure an \"orderly withdrawal\" from its contract to run the hospital, near Huntingdon, citing \"unprecedented\" increases in AE attendances and funding cuts. The CQC released its report hours later, raising \"a number of serious concerns\" about staffing, risks to patient safety and medical care. Mr Abdel-Rahman told the committee he was disappointed the inadequate rating had not been changed, even though the CQC had acknowledged 65 of the 300 errors. In one example, he told the committee a member of staff was criticised for shouting at a patient, who later turned out to be profoundly deaf. Stewart Jackson, committee member and Conservative MP for Peterborough, told David Behan, the head of the CQC, that the report was based on \"anecdote - some might say tittle-tattle.\" \"You have traduced the reputation of a popular hospital,\" Mr Jackson said. \"You should be ashamed of yourself.\" But Mr Behan said he stood by the report and many of the changes pointed out by the hospital had been based on its presentation and spelling. \"I am not ashamed of myself,\" he said. \"We did find good care at Hinchingbrooke but we also found care that needs to improve and needs to improve quickly.\" A spokeswoman for the CQC said the \"exact number of changes\" made to the report, which she said was at a draft stage, was not known. \"None of the changes that were highlighted during the factual accuracy process would have been about the overall rating of the provider,\" she said. \"Our judgments are based on what our inspection team saw and heard on their visits.\" The hospital, which was taken over in 2012 when it faced closure with debts of PS40m, is to be returned to the NHS in March. A follow up report by the CQC, due to be published in the next few weeks, is expected to say improvements have been made.",
        "The winger ran from his own half to score a dramatic counter-attack goal. Lionel Ainsworth's scooped shot evaded goalkeeper Owain Fon Williams and his defence to give Motherwell the lead. Iain Vigurs converted a penalty to bring Inverness level after Keith Lasley's foul on Ross Draper but Johnson would have the last word. Mark McGhee's Well - who move above St Johnstone into fourth - will be assured of a top-half place after the league splits in two later this month if Partick Thistle fail to beat Dundee United on Tuesday. Both sides came into the game in the Highlands off the back of impressive wins and knocked the ball around with confidence early on. They produced some neat passing moves but those were largely confined to the area between the respective penalty boxes with little creativity in the final third. It took 24 minutes before either goalkeeper was forced into action when Carl Tremarco finally found space for a cross from the left that picked out Liam Hughes. The former Cambridge United striker managed to loop a header on target but it was a comfortable save in the end for Connor Ripley - as it was just a few minutes later. This time it was Miles Storey who provided the cross from the left with Hughes getting across his marker to glance a header that the visiting goalkeeper grabbed gratefully. Storey himself should have done better when Motherwell were again opened up down the same flank in first-half stoppage time but he could only direct Andrea Mbuyi-Mutombo's cross wide from close range. Media playback is not supported on this device Motherwell's main threat came from the occasional set piece and Stevie Hammell's delivery caused problems for the Inverness defence but Chris Cadden guided the ball wide. After a sterile opening hour, Fon Williams made a mess of gathering a cross and Louis Moult set up Ainsworth to lob in the opening goal. The lead did not last long, however, as Lasley was penalised for taking down Draper and Vigurs scored against his former club from 12 yards. However, Johnson raced away following an Inverness corner to fire past Fon Williams as time ran out.",

        "French striker Moussa Dembele, 20, has made an instant impact this season with 12 goals for the Scottish champions. But the latest Dembele - no relation - came on for the final nine minutes of Celtic Under-20s' win against Hearts. He replaced Jack Aitchison, 16, who became Celtic's youngest-ever player in the final game of last season. Aitchison scored with his first touch after coming on as a substitute aged 16 years and 71 days in their 7-0 rout of Motherwell in May. But Ivorian Dembele could challenge that record after appearing for the club's reserve team, which is seven years above his age group. Dembele went viral with a series of tricks playing for Celtic's U13s at the St Kevin's Boys Academy Cup tournament in Dublin this summer. Celtic's website said Dembele \"didn't look out of place\" after being given his chance on Monday at Greenock Morton's Cappielow ground, with six of their usual squad away on Scotland U19s duty. The 15-year-old Kieran McGrath also played. Celtic's head of youth, Chris McCart, added: \"We were all delighted to see Karamoko make his debut for the development squad against Hearts in what proved to be an entertaining game. \"The fact that he was playing against other players seven years his senior gives an indication of the quality this young boy possesses and it was also fitting that he came on for Jack Aitchison, the club's youngest-ever goalscorer. \"What we need to remember, though, is that Karamoko is just 13 years old. He was given a chance to play last night on merit, as was Kieran, but it is very important that we continue their development at a measured pace. \"Karamoko is still a young boy and has a lot of growing to do, both physically and mentally. \"The coaches at our under-13 and 14 levels have been fantastic in nurturing his potential, but it is crucial that we do not push him too far, too soon. \"He has a lot of hard work ahead of him to make it to the top and we won't rush that, but we also know Karamoko, and the other talented young players we have here, is at the perfect place to continue his progress and we look forward to seeing what the future holds for this young player.\"",
        "The Electoral Reform Society attacked both sides of the referendum campaign, saying people felt \"ill-informed\" by the \"dire\" debate. The society said the impact of political leaders had been \"minimal.\" It called for a \"root and branch\" review of the way referendums are run. Recommendations made by the society in its report include having a public body intervene when \"misleading\" claims are made by campaigns, reviewing broadcasters' role and publishing a \"rule book\" to govern conduct by campaigns. They also propose that future referendums have a guaranteed six month official campaign, and citizenship education be extended in schools with the voting age reduced to 16. The UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June by 51.9 to 48.1. The then prime minister David Cameron and the government backed a Remain vote, while the Leave campaign was fronted by ex-mayor of London Boris Johnson, who is now foreign secretary. The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for \"democratic reform,\" said its polling showed Mr Cameron and other political \"big beasts\" had failed to convince the public. When asked about eight prominent politicians, most people said they had had no effect on the way they voted. The only high-profile figures who, according to the poll, persuaded more voters of their position than drove them to vote the other way were Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and US presidential candidate Donald Trump, who backed Brexit. \"Above all, what these numbers tell us is that people had by and large lost faith in established political figures as opinion-leaders - except where those figures might be said to be kicking against the establishment,\" the society said. It said voters had viewed both sides as increasingly negative, and many \"simply did not trust\" their key claims. These included Remain saying households would be on average PS4,300 a year worse off outside the EU and Leave claiming an extra PS350m a week could be spent on the NHS. The government's controversial mail-shot to every household in the UK had \"little effect on people's levels of informedness,\" it said, and towards the end of the campaign nearly half of voters thought politicians were \"mostly telling lies.\" The society said the EU debate was in \"stark contrast\" to the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, which it said had featured a \"vibrant, well-informed, grassroots conversation that left a lasting legacy of on-going public participation in politics and public life.\" The society's chief executive Katie Ghose said: \"This report shows without a shadow of a doubt just how dire the EU referendum debate really was. \"There were glaring democratic deficiencies in the run-up to the vote, with the public feeling totally ill-informed. Both sides were viewed as highly negative by voters, while the top-down, personality-based nature of the debate failed to address major policies and issues, leaving the public in the dark.\" On the plus side, the society said it had heard \"time and again\" from people who felt the referendum was the first time their vote \"had truly counted.\" But it said there were \"serious questions\" to be asked about the place of referendums in politics, including how they sit alongside the parliamentary system and how to ensure a \"high quality\" debate. Ms Ghose added: \"Now that the dust is starting to settle after the EU referendum, we need a complete rethink about the role of referendums in the UK. They are becoming more common, but the piecemeal nature of the how, when and why they're done means we could simply end up jumping from referendum to referendum at the whim of politicians.\" BMG Research polled over 1,000 UK-based adults every month from February until the end of the campaign for the Electoral Reform Society's report. The Cabinet Office said: \"The British people spoke decisively at the referendum, with one of the highest turnouts of any vote seen in a UK-wide poll in a generation. \"They voted to leave the European Union - and this government will deliver on the people's verdict.\"",
        "NHS managers have proposed a temporary downgrade of the hospital's maternity and paediatric services to cope with staffing shortages. The board of East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust will make a decision on Friday. One paediatric nurse, who asked not to be named, said staff were devastated for their patients. She said: \"It's going to mean that many more children will have to make journeys across to Hastings at a time when they are particularly vulnerable. \"They're sick. Their families are vulnerable. And I think it's going to have massive implications for children who are sick and for children who are long-term disabled.\" The NHS trust said the changes were being brought in for safety reasons because it was unable to recruit suitable specialist doctors which had led to an over-reliance on temporary and agency staff. Several options are being considered, but the trust has said its preferred plan is to have consultant-led obstetric services, neonatal services including the special care baby unit, in-patient paediatric services and emergency gynaecology services at the Conquest Hospital in Hastings. Eastbourne hospital would have a stand-alone midwifery-led maternity unit and enhanced paediatric care. Paediatrician Dr David Scott said: \"They [patients] will get a better service if they go to Hastings because they will get staff who will be better trained. \"There will be greater consultant availability so they will see more senior better trained staff. It will also allow us to increase the levels of nursing care available on the ward.\" Liz Walke, from the campaign group Save the DGH, which opposes the changes at Eastbourne, said: \"We would like an independent body coming in and looking at the whole organisation to see if they can do something better and actually reorganise the services so that both hospitals keep their core services.\"",

        "The Republican nominee's latest outreach to black voters, at a North Carolina rally, drew a swift backlash. Many on social media questioned whether Mr Trump had considered the US history of slavery and segregation. It follows a report that his charity used funds to settle lawsuits for which he was personally liable. At Tuesday's campaign event in Kenansville, the White House hopeful said: \"We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. \"Ever, ever, ever.\" Obama's legacy in black America He continued: \"You take a look at the inner cities, you get no education, you get no jobs, you get shot walking down the street. \"They're worse, I mean honestly, places like Afghanistan are safer than some of our inner cities. \"And I say to the African-American communities, and I think it's resonating, because you see what's happening with my poll numbers with African Americans. They're going, like, high.\" The businessman-turned-politician is continuing his outreach to African-American voters by meeting a group of pastors Wednesday in Cleveland, Ohio. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says Mr Trump's recent overtures to the black community may be aimed primarily at assuring moderate white voters of his racial sensitivity. According to recent polls, he still faces an uphill climb in winning over even a modest level of black support. Aside from a blip in one unconventional tracking poll, Mr Trump's black support continues to be mired in low single digits. This is roughly equal to the levels earned by the Republicans who ran against Barack Obama, the first black US president. Last month, Mr Trump also raised eyebrows when he asked black voters: \"What do you have to lose?\" He told a nearly all-white audience in Michigan that African Americans \"are living in poverty\" and their \"schools are no good.\" Mr Trump said his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, \"would rather provide a job to a refugee\" than to unemployed black youths. Meanwhile, his running mate Mike Pence has been defending the nominee against new criticism of his charitable foundation. What's the deal with the Trump Foundation? The vice-presidential candidate told NBC in an interview aired on Tuesday evening that he is confident the Trump Foundation \"fully complied with the law.\" The Washington Post reported hours earlier that Mr Trump used 258,000 from his charity for legal settlements involving his Mar-a-Largo resort in Florida and a New York golf course. The transactions could violate federal tax laws against using charities for \"self-dealing,\" according to the newspaper. The Post reported that in 2007, Mr Trump used foundation funds when his Palm Beach club was fined 120,000 by the town for having a flagpole almost twice the height allowed under local rules. As part of the settlement, he donated 125,000 to veterans' charities from the Trump Foundation. The foundation's money comes mainly from other donors, not Mr Trump himself. The Post also reported that in 2010, a golfer sued when he was denied a 1m prize for a hole-in-one in a charity tournament at Mr Trump's course outside New York City. A 158,000 settlement also came from the Trump Foundation. The report was based on interviews and legal documents. Mr Pence told NBC there are \"a number of factual errors in that story,\" though he was unable to specify any.",

Earlier this week, an all-girls school rejected a newspaper report that said its teachers were asked to stop addressing students as girls, ladies and women in favour of gender-neutral language.

        "Manor's operating company Just Racing Services has been in administration since 6 January, and FRP Advisory has been unable to find a buyer. Just Racing ceased trading on Friday, effectively ending the Manor team. The staff were sent home on Friday and told they will be made redundant by the close of business on Tuesday after the payment of January salaries. FRP said there was \"no sustainable operational or financial structure in place to maintain the group as a going concern.\" Joint administrator Geoff Rowley added the administration process \"provided a moratorium\" in the search for a buyer but \"no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form.\" It is not necessarily the end of Manor - a buyer could potentially still purchase the remnants of the team. But even if that were to happen, the move makes it much harder for Manor to make it to the start of the season in Australia on 26 March. The team's collapse leaves 10 teams - 20 cars - on the grid in Melbourne and comes just five days after the sport was taken over by US company Liberty Media and long-time commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone was removed as chief executive. Media playback is not supported on this device Manor started life as Virgin Racing in 2010 and has been through several guises in the intervening seven years. It previously went into administration in October 2014, and was only saved by current owner Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of energy firm Ovo, on the eve of the 2015 season. Fitzpatrick has said the decisive moment was the team's slip to 11th place in the constructors' championship as a result of Sauber's Felipe Nasr finishing ninth in the penultimate race of last season in Brazil. This cost the team in the region of 15m (PS12m) in prize money. Manor were one of three new teams to enter F1 in 2010 after they were promised by then FIA president Max Mosley that a PS40m budget cap would be introduced. But Mosley stood down as head of the governing body in 2009 after losing a fight with the teams over the plan and the cost limit was abandoned. All three teams have now collapsed.

I am very concerned that this follows other job losses in small teams. \"Formula One Group, its owners and the FIA as a regulator really need to be investigated after this collapse. \"The unfair way in which prize money is allocated in the sport, permanently favouring the largest teams regardless of their finishing position, has seen many teams struggle to survive and ultimately reduced the number of cars on the grid. \"The European Commission must investigate the complaints it received last year from two F1 teams related to anti-competitive practices before even more highly skilled jobs are lost both in the South East and all around Europe. \"I will be writing to the Commission to call on them to take serious action on the way F1 is run, before a sport loved by 500 million fans is damaged beyond repair.\"",

Mr Callingham, who has been with the RSPCA for 25 years, said: \"The location was extremely remote; there are no homes, farms or equestrian centres nearby, so it is clear this pony was deliberately left with no intention of return. \"Her left hind leg was severely swollen to twice the size, and three large, deep holes that were bleeding and covered in maggots were clearly visible. \"It was terrible to see this young pony clearly in a huge amount of pain.\" He added: \"The wounds had been sprayed with a purple antiseptic spray, which suggests the owner was aware of the injury, but clearly failed to seek appropriate veterinary advice. \"She had a good body condition and trimmed hooves, so it is likely the owner was overwhelmed by the injury and reluctant to seek further treatment, for whatever reason.\" On advice of the vet, the pony was put down to end her severe pain and suffering.

        "Flood water swept through Linen Green, near Dungannon. Several vehicles were damaged at a nearby Road Service depot. Twenty four people were helped to safety as flooding affected parts of Northern Ireland. Counties Tyrone, Londonderry and Fermanagh were worst affected, as Storm Desmond brought high winds and heavy rain on Saturday. A number of roads remain closed due to flooding and fallen trees. Gareth Bell, whose shoe shop was one of 31 units affected by flooding at the Linen Green complex, said there were \"a lot of people in disbelief.\" \"As retailers, it's hard to fathom just how much it can ruin things over Christmas for everybody,\" he said. Rivers Agency chief executive David Porter said the flooding was caused by a blocked culvert grille that caused the water to overflow. He said the grille had been cleaned on Friday as part of weekly maintenance checks, but the sheer amount of rainfall brought down debris to block it. \"We were just hit by nature and a very significant rainstorm, although I would say that what we have seen, particularly in the west of the province, is a very good multi-agency approach to dealing with the flooding,\" he said. The Fire and Rescue Service said it dealt with 31 flooding incidents. Most of those rescued were in vehicles that had become stranded in flood waters. In one incident in Strabane, County Tyrone, 10 people were rescued from flooded properties at a housing development. \"We used ladders and inflatable rescue sleds to take them to safety, and other agencies have been involved in providing emergency accommodation,\" said Group Commander Andy Sinclair. Assistant Chief Fire Officer Alan Walmsley said it had been a busy night for them. \"We started receiving our first calls for assistance to flooding incidents late in the afternoon, and those calls continued throughout the evening, spiking in the early hours of Sunday,\" he said. A \"high volume pumping team\" worked for 13 hours in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh, to \"try and hold back flood water from impacting on the local community,\" he said. He said the worst affected areas were \"around the Strabane area, also Fintona and Enniskillen, and in the early hours it moved inward to around Cookstown.\" In Clady, County Tyrone, an elderly man trapped by rising flood waters was rescued by a team that used a mechanical digger to reach him. Gerard Foley, who lives in Clady, said on Sunday morning that the village was still badly affected by flooding. \"There are houses on the hill, and the rest is just water - Clady is a complete river,\" he said. \"You couldn't even pinpoint where the river is.\" Road users have been warned about the risk of surface water flooding, as well as the risk of fallen trees or branches and other debris. Stormont Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said households affected by flooding can apply to local councils for an emergency payment. Mr Durkan said: \"Individual householders will be eligible for a PS1,000 payment as an offer of practical assistance to those who have suffered severe inconvenience, to ensure homes are made habitable as quickly as possible.\" He added: \"If you feel that you may be entitled to the payment, contact your local council as soon as possible and they will arrange for an urgent inspection of your property.\"",

He said there was \"nothing half-hearted\" about Labour's campaign and said he would continue to make the case for membership in the run-up to polling day. But Mr Field will say: \"The last thing Jeremy needs to do is to undermine further the traditional Labour vote, much of which wishes to leave the European Union. \"For the party leader more actively to campaign for the Remain campaign will push even more Labour voters into the arms of UKIP.\" Mr Field, who campaigns for \"balanced migration,\" will criticise an \"open-door policy\" which he says pushes down wages and puts a strain on public services. Ahead of the speech, Mr Field said Labour MPs' overwhelming support for staying in the EU was \"very unrepresentative\" of the views of many of the party's activists in the country at large. \"While the polls show a majority of Labour voters support staying in Europe, about 40 do not and the number of MPs who represent that view are a mere handful,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. \"It is our job to make a good case for leaving Europe so these voters feel that at last their views are being represented in the debate.\" The Leave campaign has targeted migration this week with interventions from Michael Gove and Boris Johnson as it attempted to regain the initiative following warnings about the economic effect of a vote to leave. Alan Johnson, who is leading his party's Remain campaign, will claim a vote to stay in the EU would be as important as the election of Labour's reforming government in 1945, which led to the creation of the NHS and expanded welfare. \"From nurses and builders to railway workers, steel workers, postal workers and shop workers, trade unions will be campaigning for a Britain that remains in Europe,\" he will tell the Usdaw union's conference. \"The rights of working people are protected by our EU membership, and Labour and our union movement are united in campaigning for Britain to remain in Europe.\" Elsewhere in the EU debate, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee published what it said was a \"reliable, unbiased analysis\" of the issues involved. The cross-party committee, which was divided on whether to back EU membership, said it had chosen not to endorse either side. Instead it urged voters to consider the UK's trading relationship with the rest of the EU and the rest of the world, its \"international representation and reputation\" and how the EU and its policies might develop in the future. Committee chairman Crispin Blunt said: \"The referendum offers the British people a once-in-a-generation opportunity to chart a course for the UK's role in the world. \"Voters should consider not only the short-term consequences of staying or leaving but the long-term opportunities and challenges.\"",
        "The Public Administration Committee said it would seek written evidence and publish an interim report before the summer recess later this month. Eurosceptic Tories fear the rules are being amended to allow the government to campaign openly to stay in the EU. But ministers say it is needed to allow them to continue their work. The committee, headed by Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, said the purdah probe would form the first part of a wide-ranging inquiry into the EU Referendum Bill, the proposed law that will authorise a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU by the end of 2017. Mr Jenkin said he and his colleagues wanted to know why the government was planning to partially \"disapply\" the existing rules on government announcements in the four weeks leading up to the referendum. The inquiry will focus on the existing rules, as set out in the 2000 Political Parties and Referendum Act, the government's case for amending them, how ministers plan to go about it and the impact it will have on the impartiality of the civil service. In a vote on the issue last month, 27 Conservative MPs rebelled against their party, urging ministers to reinstate the full purdah period although the government won the vote after Labour abstained. The government has said the existing rules would potentially prevent ministers from attending EU meetings and making decisions with a European dimension. They have insisted they will address MPs' concerns about this and other matters - such as the funding available to different sides and the length of the campaign itself - as the bill makes its way through the Commons. The committee will publish its report on 22 July.",
        "The hashtag KamiTidakTakut has emerged in the aftermath of Thursday's attacks. A common meme, of a peace sign with a Jakarta landmark in its centre, was adapted from an image used on social media after the Paris attacks. Where the Eiffel Tower stood in the Paris version, this shows Indonesia's National Monument. It stands in the centre of Jakarta as a symbol of the country's struggle for independence. It is a famous landmark and popular meeting point in the city. A photograph that appeared to show a satay seller continuing to work at his stall after blasts were heard was circulated widely online. Some Twitter users wrote alongside it: \"Fear is not in our dictionary.\" The photograph was first uploaded to a local social media site, with a comment saying the stall was 100m away from the site of the bombs, which had happened two hours earlier. The satay seller has since been interviewed by Indonesian media. Another popular hashtag was JakartaBerani, which can be translated as \"Jakarta is Brave.\" Soon after reports started to filter through on Thursday morning (local time) that explosions had been heard, Twitter users started to use the hashtag PrayforJakarta. It is not a new hashtag. It had previously been used in cases of severe flooding, but was used again as people from Indonesia and around the world shared their sympathy for the city. Aulia Masna, a technology blogger in Jakarta, said the morning's events had shown Indonesians used Twitter as much as ever for updates. He tweeted that \"everyone flocks to Twitter,\" and the microblogging site was not being \"abandoned\" by Indonesians as some had said.",
        "Soon he won't need a book to learn more about this tiny British overseas territory in the Mediterranean, just south of Spain. Following the lead of the UK town of Monmouth, Gibraltar is aiming to spill the content of the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia into the real world. To do this, it is equipping Gibraltar's tourist attractions with QR codes - \"quick response\" barcodes that can be scanned with a mobile phone. These black-and-white pixelated images have been around for more than two decades but have started to gain mainstream acceptance only in the past few years, appearing on everything from walls and billboards to newspapers and detergent packs. As well as other technologies such as near-field communication tags (NFC) and augmented reality (AR) apps, they give mobile phone users information about a particular object. QR codes store text, phone numbers, email addresses and calendar events, and once scanned, create links to websites or generate some interactive content on your smartphone's screen. Tourism is a big part of Gibraltar's economy, with more than 11 million visitors spending PS280m last year, and the authorities are keen to seize any opportunity to increase revenue. The QR codes take users directly to a Wikipedia page of the relevant tourist attraction, says Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum. \"Gibraltar is a multi-layered cake of historical events, starting with the Neanderthals of 50,000 years ago through to modern humans,\" he says. What are QR codes' chances? QR codes have been around for years, but only 11 of UK smartphone users scanned one in July 2012, according to data agency Comscore. Some analysts have been saying that other technologies such as NFC, which lets you get information wirelessly just by waving your phone in front of the chip, may eventually replace QR. But QR supporters argue that NFC is not quite there yet - it is expensive to create tags, and for now, not many phones can scan them. QR codes are free to create, cheap to install and nearly all modern smartphones have apps that can read them. Augmented reality apps are also a potential threat - they allow information to appear on your handset's screen simply by pointing the phone towards an object of interest. Google Glass headset could even take this one step further, and make information appear right in front of the user's eyes. But QR is far from being dead - and recent moves by the electronic giants Apple and Microsoft could give it a push. The technology will be integrated into Apple's Passbook ticketcoupon wallet service, available on the forthcoming iOS6 operating system. It will allow users to get into a cinema, check in for a flight, or redeem a coupon via their phone. Microsoft has recently signed a licensing agreement with NeoMedia, one of the pioneers in the mobile barcodes field, to acquire all of the firm's QR code patents. \"Our own caving unit has now catalogued over 200 caves in Rock, with many being rich in archaeology but inaccessible to most people. \"Here we have another way of getting all this information across to the world.\" \"Gibraltarpedia\" organisers want their QR codes to communicate with the user's phone to determine its set-up language, so a Brazilian tourist can be taken to a page in Portuguese, a Turk to one in Turkish and so on, says Roger Bamkin, a consultant to the Gibraltar government and a volunteer from Wikimedia UK, the charity that supports the online encyclopaedia. \"By scanning QR codes around them, tourists will be to able to find out about the place they are visiting in their own language, with the description written by a volunteer speaking that language,\" he says. Volunteers have been producing up to 20 articles a day in various languages, and Mr Bamkin has been in Gibraltar this week seeking more people to contribute photos, maps and information on the territory's history. But once all the landmarks are equipped with codes and all the articles are written, other factors need to be dealt with for the project to take off. Roaming charges may deter visitors from connecting to the web - and the government of Gibraltar says it is considering the possibility of free wi-fi. Also, tourists should be familiar with QR codes and be willing to use them. Although people may be used to seeing them, not many in the Western world actually scan them. On the other hand, in Japan and South Korea many use them on a daily basis. Tesco Korea lets consumers shop in a virtual supermarket while standing on a subway platform. They scan images of groceries with a QR code reader and buy them with a click. But Gibraltarpedia organisers say that they realise QR codes may be replaced by other technology - just as DVDs replaced CDs, says Mr Bamkin. However, he believes that the project will be a success - and be it QR, NFC or any other future tech, Wikipedia is aiming to bridge online and offline worlds. \"Projects like Gibraltarpedia are a test of our mission,\" says Mr Bamkin, adding that the next target is expansion into northern Africa. \"Africans have a great need of free information - there are many more Wikipedia articles in the UK or France than there are in Morocco, Algeria, or Mali.\"",
        "Asghar Buksh, 55, repeatedly struck mother-of-six Nasreen Buksh over the head with a heavy blunt object which has never been found. He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: \"I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it.\" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: \"The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. \"They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other.\" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: \"My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. \"This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. \"He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind.\" Judge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.",

        "Up to 40 of goods Venezuela subsidises for its domestic market are smuggled to Colombia, where they are sold at much higher prices, the authorities say. The border was closed on Monday night, and will be each night for a month. The move has been agreed with the Colombian government. The Venezuelan government initially announced that it planned to close the 2,200km-long (1,360-mile) border every night for an indefinite period. But later the general in charge of the operation, Vladimir Padrino Lopez, clarified that the ban will be lifted after a month. The border is being closed between 22:00 local time (02:30 GMT) and 05:00 (09:30 GMT). Cargo vehicles, including vans and lorries, will be banned from crossing from Venezuela to Colombia between 18:00 (22:30 GMT) and 05:00 (09:30 GMT). Venezuela, which has the world's cheapest petrol prices, estimates 100,000 barrels of petrol are smuggled through its western border every day and sold illegally in Colombia. The 17,000-strong contingent \"will be enough to guarantee security\" along the border, said Gen Padrino Lopez. The governor of Venezuela's western state of Tachira, Jose Vielma Mora, said that regional leaders support means the measure will be effective. \"There is plenty of evidence to show that most of the smuggling is done overnight,\" he told El Universal. Dissatisfaction with the shortage of many staples, as well as rampant crime and high inflation, led thousands of people in the western Venezuelan states of Tachira and Merida to take to the streets in January. The protests quickly spread to the rest of Venezuela, which faced similar problems. The opposition blames failed left-wing policies of the past 15 years - initiated with the late president, Hugo Chavez - for the country's economic crisis. The smuggling of cheap goods from Venezuela is also seen as a major problem in Colombia. The Colombian government says it leads to a big loss in taxes and complaints of unfair competition by local businesses. The profits from are often used to finance drug gangs and left-wing guerrillas, says the BBC's Arturo Wallace in Bogota. President Nicolas Maduro discussed the measures with his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, at a summit on 1 August.",

        "In the three months to June 2014, there were 960 initial decisions to place a child for adoption, compared with 1,830 in the three months to September 2013. The figures were released by the Adoption Leadership Board (ALB). The ALB says the drop in adoptions may have been influenced by recent court judgements in care and adoption cases. The board, which was established by the government as part of a shake-up of the adoption system, said applications for court orders allowing a child to be placed for adoption had fallen by 34. There had also been a fall of 54 in the number of placement orders granted by courts, from 1,650 to 750, it said. In recent years, adoption figures had risen to record levels, with an increase of 63, the ALB said. But last September, the most senior family court judge criticised the \"sloppy practice\" of social workers when bringing cases for adoption before the courts and said they were not looking closely enough at all the other options. President of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, also implied that, at a time of tight budgets, adoption may be seen as a cheaper option than helping troubled families or foster carers and warned about \"resource issues\" affecting local authorities' thinking. He said there had been four cases during 10 days in July alone in which judges had expressed concerns about inadequate analysis by social services in support of the case for adoption. ALB chairman, Sir Martin Narey, said these court judgements had been \"entirely sensible.\" But he warned that they were being misinterpreted by local authorities who thought the law on adoption had changed. He told the BBC that the recent drop in children being put forward for adoption was primarily due to fewer local authorities deciding adoption was the best option for a child. \"It's then been compounded by the refusal of some applications at the court,\" he said. Sir Martin said some councils seemed to have taken some court rulings to mean that if a child could remain in foster care, then \"that will do,\" when in fact the best interests of the child must be pursued. Sir Martin said the drop followed two years of significant progress in finding more adoptive homes for the thousands of children waiting. The number of children adopted across the UK has risen from 3,100 in 2011 to 5,050 in the last year. The recent fall in children being put forward for adoption in England has prompted Sir Martin to issue guidance to clarify the meaning of recent court judgements. \"It is clear from my discussions with social workers and managers in local authorities and in voluntary adoption agencies that there is a belief that the law has been fundamentally changed by a number of court judgements. \"So I am pleased to produce this simple myth-busting guide - drafted by a senior queen's counsel - to what those judgements do and do not say. \"I am extremely grateful to Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, for his advice. He has seen the document and is supportive of its aim of dispelling the myths that have arisen.\" Messages included in Sir Martin's guidance reiterated that the legal test for adoption had not changed, and courts must be provided with expert, high quality, evidence-based analysis of all realistic options for a child and the arguments for and against each of these. Sir Martin said: \"The board and I have published this guide to help everyone working for children understand the law around these complex cases, and be confident in making the right decisions for the child.\"",

        "Lawyers for Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman made the admission following action by ClientEarth. But Judge Mr Justice Mitting said any enforcement action was a matter for the European Commission. He refused to make any declaration, or to order Mrs Spelman to outline plans for cutting pollution levels. ClientEarth had complained that Mrs Spelman had failed to consult on proposals which demonstrated how the UK aimed to comply with EU limits on levels of nitrogen dioxide. It asked the judge to declare that plans set out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) did not comply with EU law, and order Mrs Spelman to publish revised proposals. Government lawyers challenged the claim and said no High Court order was needed. Mr Justice Mitting said a lawyer had conceded that \"the government is in breach of obligations\" but said he would not make any \"mandatory order.\" He said the government could admit the breach and \"leave it to the (European) Commission to take whatever action is right in enforcement.\" \"Such a mandatory order.... would raise serious political and economic questions which are simply not for a judge,\" he added. \"Courts have traditionally been wary of entering this area of political debate - for good reason.\" Mr Justice Mitting pronounced the action a \"draw\" and said costs should be shared. A spokesperson for Defra said it was happy that \"the judge has ruled on our favour.\" \"A significant part of the UK meets EU air quality limits for all pollutants and air quality has improved considerably in recent decades. \"Our air quality plans set out all the important work being done at national, regional and local level to meet all EU limits in the shortest possible time,\" the spokesperson said. Stephen Hockman QC, for ClientEarth, told the court the charity had achieved something and said: \"The government is in breach of its obligations under European law in relation to air quality. \"Although we have lost, it was a reasonable case to advance.\" A spokesman said the legal challenge had been brought because air quality plans for 17 regions and cities would not comply with legal limits for air quality until after 2015, when the deadline for achieving the limits was 1 January 2010. He said he had wanted the court to order Mrs Spelman to draw up plans that would achieve legal compliance throughout the UK by 2015, and also to make a declaration that she was in breach of her legal obligations. ClientEarth chief executive James Thornton said: \"The government's plans to tackle air pollution are frankly pathetic. They contain almost no new measures and show that they won't achieve air quality limits until 2025. It's nothing short of a disgrace.\"",
        "For months she's resisted closing her country's borders and setting an upper limit on the number of asylum seekers allowed into Germany despite rising, and at times frantic, public and political pressure to do so, including from within her own CDU party. Iron Angie - as she's sometimes known at home - demonstrated her unwavering determination once again at yesterday's EU-Turkey summit and in the lead-up to it. There have been dark mutterings in the German media that, despite increasing problems at home linked to the arrival of over a million asylum-seekers, the German chancellor has spent more time in Ankara than Aachen, Berlin or Cologne of late. But there was stubborn purpose behind the shuttling. Mrs Merkel's political future - and her legacy, after a decade as German chancellor - are hanging in the balance. She faces three key regional elections this weekend, with polls predicting huge gains for the anti-immigrant AfD party. She needed something big and bold on migration, allowing her to avoid performing an awkward U-turn on her national policies but at the same time sending a clear message to the people of Germany that she has the situation in hand. Make no mistake - it was Germany and no other European nation that insisted on a summit with Turkey this week. Turkey is key to resolving Europe's current migration chaos. That's where most refugees and others jump on board people smugglers' dinghies, risking their lives to enter Europe via the Greek islands. But trust between Turkey and the EU is not strong. An \"action plan on migration\" between the two back in November failed to yield many results. There has been little sign of Turkey cracking down on people-smugglers along its coastline, and limited evidence of the a'!3bn (PS2.3bn; 3.3bn) the EU then promised Turkey in humanitarian aid. So Mrs Merkel began a new push for what she hoped would be a better Turkish deal. Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, which represents all EU member countries in Brussels, joined in the efforts (after all, he would be the summit host), flying to Turkey ahead of Monday's meeting. But neither of these seasoned politicians were quite prepared for what is now being described as a \"Turkish bazaar\" here in Brussels. Turkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu arrived at the summit all smiles for the cameras. \"Turkey is ready to work with the European Union,\" he beamed - omitting to say at what price. Then, behind closed doors, he slammed the EU with a whole host of additional political and funding demands: Even a few months ago, my bet is that faced with this steep list of demands, EU countries would simply have turned their back and walked out. Not now. Chancellor Merkel isn't the only one desperate to solve the migrant crisis: The EU's credibility is crumbling, its members have never looked less unified and Greece, stuck with tens of thousands of stalled migrants on top of being saddled with crippling euro debt repayments, threatens to implode. The bottom line, for the EU, is to put off anybody and everybody from getting in dinghies or trying any means possible to get to Europe to improve their lives. It hopes to send every economic migrant back home and to pay to look after refugees in camps closer to theirs. Voters across Europe say they are spooked by the migrant crisis. But however much Europe's leaders and EU bosses in Brussels fear for their future, they can't compromise all their principles trying to make this problem \"go away.\" And that is why last night's summit didn't end in a deal. Of course, triumphant words flew out of the mouths of leaders and broadcasters across Europe - \"turning point,\" \"Big Bang\" and \"breakthrough.\" But that is only if - and it's a big if - the proposals are written up and signed at another migrant summit next week - and \"if\" they are then implemented. There's a lot to think about. Can the EU afford to close its eyes to the Turkish president's increasingly autocratic and arguably anti-democratic behaviour in its rush to do a migration deal? Just before the summit, the Turkish government took over one of the country's best-selling newspapers and tear-gassed outraged protesters on the streets of Ankara, for example. And what of the legal implications of the EU exporting migrants en masse back to Turkey? The UN has warned this could go against international humanitarian law, with some asylum cases needing to be heard here in Europe, they say. Turkey does not have asylum laws in place for Afghans and Iraqis for example, so what will happen to those migrants? And then there are the logistical challenges. Imagine the scenes - not just young men, but old women, wheelchair users, pregnant mothers and screaming babies, many from Syria and other troubled areas. After all they've been through to to get to Greece, will they meekly accept getting on a boat or plane to be sent back to Turkey? And these are just some of the complications surrounding an EU-Turkey deal, never mind the splits in Europe over how to deal with the migrant crisis. So, on Monday Angela Merkel got what she needed for her weekend elections: a tough-sounding something with the promise of a Turkey deal in the offing. Conveniently for her, the votes will be counted in Germany before the talk from the summit begins to publicly unravel.",

Ifill had been absent for last week's election coverage due to ongoing health issues and had been on leave since May. \"She was a journalist's journalist and set an example for all around her,\" said a PBS NewsHour executive producer. \"Gwen was a standard bearer for courage, fairness and integrity in an industry going through seismic change,\" said producer Sarah Just. \"She was a mentor to so many across the industry and her professionalism was respected across the political spectrum.\" At a daily news conference, President Barack Obama offered his \"deepest condolences\" from himself and the first lady. \"She was a friend of ours, she was an extraordinary journalist, she always kept faith with the fundamental responsibilities of her profession,\" he said. Ifill had moderated two vice-presidential debates as well as a Democratic primary debate last year. In 2004 she moderated the debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards, and in 2008 between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. Last year she hosted the primary debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Sarah Glover, the president of the National Associated of Black Journalists, expressed her condolences on Facebook, saying that Ifill \"was a transformative voice among journalists.\" In 2013, after being named co-host of PBS Newshour, Ifill told the New York Times that she hoped she would inspire future minority journalists. \"When I was a little girl watching programs like this - because that's the kind of nerdy family we were - I would look up and not see anyone who looked like me in any way.

Stokes says his England team-mates have joked about the fee paid for him. \"I found it tough to talk about but the group that we have, it's funny to be around them because it's just taking the mickey out of everyone,\" Stokes said. \"Everyone gets brought back down to earth. It's just the way we operate, which is why it's such a good environment to be in at the moment.\" England have won nine of their past 10 ODIs against West Indies and secured a 25-run victory when the two sides last met at the same venue in 2014. West Indies are ranked ninth in the world in 50-over cricket, a standing that denied them a place in this year's Champions Trophy, and will field an inexperienced side after changes to national selection. Players can only appear for the international side in limited-overs cricket if they have played the relevant format domestically in the Caribbean since 2010. \"We can't be going into this game thinking it's just going to be a walk in the park,\" Stokes added. \"We know how talented the West Indies team are - their batsmen can hit the ball out of the ground whenever they choose to and they've always had good quick bowlers.\" England captain Eoin Morgan confirmed that fast bowler Steven Finn will start Friday's match in place of Jake Ball, who suffered a knee injury in a warm-up game on Monday in St Kitts, and ahead of recent call-up Tom Curran. Sam Billings is also expected to open the batting alongside Jason Roy, with Alex Hales not yet match-fit despite joining up with the squad after recovering from a hand fracture. Morgan said his side \"have one eye on the Champions Trophy\" on home soil in June but added that West Indies could prove as tough a challenge as the 2-1 series loss in India in January. \"The way we play, aggressively and positively, isn't the easiest to adapt to West Indies conditions with slow, turning wickets,\" he said. \"The wickets here will be more challenging here than in India - those wickets were a lot more batter-friendly than we thought they were going to be.\" England probable XI: Sam Billings, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (capt), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Steven Finn.",
        "An IFA Disciplinary Committee opted not to impose any sanction after finding that Carrick did not properly implement manager Gary Haveron's touchline ban. The committee said it would \"exercise its discretion\" in the matter. A Warrenpoint Town statement argued that the decision \"contradicted the IFA's obligation to apply objectivity.\" \"The board of Warrenpoint Town have read the IFA Disciplinary Committee determination regarding the breach of Article 23.1 of the IFA Disciplinary Code by the Carrick Rangers FC Manager,\" the statement began. \"We are shocked that the IFA having found Carrick guilty failed to implement the requisite admonishment as per established rules. \"The board will be meeting soon to discuss further this matter and the complaint we formally raised surrounding eligibility which is in abeyance.\" Carrick faced a possible three-point deduction and relegation from the top flight, plus a possible fine of at least PS350, if the outcome of the hearing did not go in their favour. However in a statement released on Wednesday night, the committee indicated that \"the interests of justice were best served by not imposing a sanction in all the circumstances.\" As it stands, Ballinamallard United and Institute await a date for the second leg of their promotion-relegation play-off, the Mallards having won the first leg 2-1 at the Riverside Stadium on 6 May. Haveron sat out a three-game ban handed out by the IFA, but was in the dugout for his club's match against Dungannon Swifts on 23 April when he should not have been. \"The club did not explain to the Committee's satisfaction the reasons why the start date for the suspension set out in the initial charge letter (18 April 2016) was not complied with and therefore the challenge from Carrick Rangers was not upheld,\" read the IFA statement released on Wednesday night. \"The Committee took into account the points made on behalf of the club and decided to exercise its discretion under the overriding objective as outlined in Articles 1.6 and 1.7 of the Disciplinary Code and found that no sanction should be applied.\" \"In applying its discretion it took into account, what it found to be the honest intention of the club to serve a suspension, the fact that three matches had been served and points made regarding possible confusion in the way in which the suspension was to be implemented.\"",
        "Elizabeth Passmore's final report before retirement complains admissions are too often \"unnecessarily complex,\" \"unfair\" or unclear. Schools which are their own admissions authorities, like academies or faith schools, are more likely to be at fault, says the report. The government said it would review the findings and take action where needed. England's School Admissions Code requires places to be offered in a fair and open way, with arrangements set out so that parents can \"understand easily how places for that school will be allocated.\" Admission arrangements run by local authorities for community and voluntary controlled schools \"are almost always clear and uncomplicated so it is easy for parents and others to understand how places will be allocated\" says the report, published late last year. But \"the complexity of some schools' admission arrangements continues to be a matter of concern,\" writes Dr Passmore. \"The arrangements set by some own-admission authority schools have so many levels of priority that often it is unclear how the arrangements could actually be applied.\" These complex arrangements can include numerous oversubscription criteria, different sub-categories of places, more than one catchment area, feeder schools, banding tests and aptitude assessments, says the report. \"The complex arrangements of some schools do not serve local children well,\" adds Dr Passmore. Too often, says the report, admission arrangements are hard to find on school websites or not published at all, while some faith schools ask parents to fill in supplementary forms, asking for information prohibited under the code. Dr Passmore says banding tests are proving a particular problem. Schools say they use them to ensure a comprehensive intake but the report suggests they can be used to increase numbers of higher ability pupils. \"Children living near the school, but placed in a band with many similar children, may not be allocated a place,\" says the report. \"The first hurdle in gaining a place is to take the test.\" These tests are also expensive, up to PS500 per child to administer, and the report questions the effects of banding on children, its purpose and costs. Dr Passmore also said she was \"surprised and concerned\" by an increase in schools operating as their own admissions authorities employing lawyers when they receive objections to the criteria they use to admit children. \"Schools should be able to construct lawful arguments to their arrangements without recourse to legal advice,\" she writes. Overall the report notes the adjudicator dealt with 218 admissions cases in 2014-15, down from 274 the previous year, but the number upheld or partially upheld rose to 159, from 99 in 2013-14. And local authorities withdrew 284 offers of school places because of fraud, up from 186 the previous year. Margaret Tulloch of the Comprehensive Futures campaign group described the report as \"very disturbing\" and called for a \"wholesale review of school admissions.\" \"She is right to raise concerns about own-admission authority schools failing to meet the requirement of the code and about so-called fair banding. \"These problems will only increase as more schools become academies.\" A Department for Education spokesman said the government wanted every child to have the opportunity of going to a good local school. \"The chief adjudicator's annual report helps us identify how we can continue to improve the admissions framework to ensure fair access for all children. \"We will review her findings and take action where appropriate.\" said the spokesman.",
        "William Johnston, of Walsham-le-Willows, Suffolk, admitted dumping the rubbish, described as building material and household waste, last April. Suffolk Police said it was a \"potential danger to motorists and other members of the public.\" The 44-year-old admitted the whole episode was \"hugely embarrassing\" and \"regrettable\" as he left court. He dumped the rubbish, described as building material and household waste, at the side of Finningham Road on 9 April last year. Updates on this story and others from Suffolk Police officers and the Environment Agency removed the waste, which they believe was unloaded using a tractor and trailer. Johnston was fined PS1000 plus costs of PS1600 after pleading guilty to fly-tipping at Bury St Edmunds Magistrates Court. In a statement, he said the rubbish had been unlawfully dumped on his own land before he moved it, and he later paid PS4,000 for it to be cleared up from the side of the road. Jonathan Reed, prosecuting on behalf of Mid Suffolk District Council said he was pleased the court had recognised the \"severity of the offences as well as the dangers to users of the highway.\"",
        "South African firm Famous Brands signed a PS120m deal to buy the chain from Nando's owner, Capricorn Ventures. Gourmet Burger Kitchen, founded in 2001, was a \"pioneer of the premium burger revolution,\" Famous Brands said. The company says that it wants to open 10 to 15 more burger restaurants a year in the UK. The mass-market burger giants, McDonalds and Burger King, first opened in the UK in the 1970s. While those brands have continued to expand, by the end of the 1990s a new fashion for more expensive burgers had arrived, again from the US. Upmarket burger brands in the UK now include Byron, Shake Shack and Five Guys, as well as an increasing number of independents. According to analysts Mintel, the premium burger market now accounts for sales worth more than PS3bn a year. Famous Brands plans to double Gourmet Burger Kitchen's 75 UK stores in the next five years and said Brexit uncertainty would not affect its plans. Consumers still want food that is quick and convenient, but are willing to pay for better ingredients, said Famous Brands' Kevin Hedderwick. \"The fast-casual premium environment is pretty recession-proof,\" he said. The price difference between upmarket and fast-food burger shops is quite striking. Whereas a typical McDonald's quarter-pounder with cheese will set you back less than PS3, a Gourmet Burger Kitchen 4oz classic cheeseburger is more than PS6. But Gourmet Burger Kitchen also sells more unusual fare, including buffalo burgers and Persian lamb. Food fashions in the UK range from the super-health-conscious to the indulgent. And at the indulgent end of the scale, consumers are focusing on the quality of the ingredients and being able to personalise the menu, by selecting different options. \"Consumers see freshly made burgers as the biggest marker of a gourmet burger venue, something that sets them apart, as this is not traditionally offered by fast food venues,\" said Kiti Soininen, head of UK food and drink research at Mintel. \"Customisation is also a top expectation for gourmet offerings, in line with a more general demand for knowing what goes into one's food and the trend for personalisation.\"",

        "A pre-inquest review was due to take place on Monday, but has now been postponed until March. West Sussex County Council said the full inquest was now likely to be held late 2017, but was \"very dependent\" on the police investigation. A lawyer representing some of the victims' families described \"a measure of frustration\" at the news. A vintage hawker hunter jet crashed on to the A27 during an aerobatic stunt at the Shoreham show in August 2015, killing 11 men. The pilot, Andrew Hill, 51, survived the crash and is being investigated for manslaughter. Plans were put in place for the inquest to begin in March, but neither the police investigation nor the full Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) report have yet been published. Specialist aviation lawyer James Healey Pratt said the victims' families had full confidence in the coroner and the investigation. He said the pre-inquest hearing was being delayed until March as a decision by the CPS on whether to bring charges was due then. He also revealed the families had been invited to a meeting in Farnborough on 19 December, at which they would be told the results of the AAIB investigation. Sussex Police's report is not expected until the new year at the earliest. West Sussex Senior Coroner Penelope Schofield said the decision to postpone the pre-inquest review was \"not taken lightly,\" particularly as she was anxious to ensure the inquests were dealt with in a timely manner. But it was anticipated little progress could be made with the police and AAIB report still outstanding, she added.",
        "Gillian Triggs told a senate committee that she had been asked to resign and offered a new role. The shadow attorney general has written to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) seeking an immediate investigation. The HRC released a report condemning the treatment of children in detention. Their report said that detaining children of asylum seekers violated international human rights law, and called for their release. Speaking to journalists in Sydney on Wednesday, Mr Abbott repeated his earlier statements that the government had lost confidence in Ms Triggs as president of the HRC. \"What she does is a matter for her,\" said Mr Abbott in response to a question about whether she should resign. \"As the secretary of the Attorney General's Department has made clear, she was not asked to resign and no inducement has been offered.\" On Tuesday, Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott launched a scathing attack on the HRC report, saying that it was a \"political stitch-up.\" Earlier in a senate hearing, Ms Triggs said that she had been asked to resign during a meeting on 3 February by the secretary of Attorney General George Brandis' department. \"I rejected it out of hand,\" she said, as quoted by ABC News. Ms Triggs told the hearing that the department's secretary, Chris Moraitis, had said that she would be offered another job with the government. She added that she had been \"very shaken and shocked\" by the \"disgraceful proposal\" and had reminded Mr Moraitis that she had a five-year statutory position. In a letter to the AFP commissioner, Shadow Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said: \"The attorney general's offer to an independent statutory officer of an inducement to resign her position as president, with the object of affecting the leadership of the [HRC] to avoid political damage to the Abbott government may constitute corrupt and unlawful conduct.\" ABC News reported that Mr Dreyfus said that Ms Triggs preferred not to use the term \"inducement\" but that she had made it clear that the resignation request and the offer of a job had been connected. Local media reported that Mr Moraitis has denied asking Ms Triggs to resign but said they had discussed the possibility of her taking on another role. The attorney general admitted to the senate committee that he had lost confidence in Ms Triggs because of the timing of the inquiry into detained children, according to local media. He added that \"as a matter of goodwill\" he had told Mr Moraitis that he hoped that she could be encouraged to serve the government in other capacities. The HRC report, entitled The Forgotten Children, was published earlier in February. It said a third of detained children had developed mental illnesses of such severity that they required psychiatric treatment. The number of children in detention has fallen under Mr Abbott's government. He has questioned why the HRC did not launch an inquiry when the Labor government was in power and there were almost 2,000 children in detention centres. Successive Australian governments have been criticised over their harsh asylum policies, under which asylum seekers are detained for long periods in offshore camps while their applications are processed.",
        "John Biggadike died when he fell while in the hoist and was impaled on a metal post at Boston Pilgrim Hospital. At Lincoln Crown Court, the prosecution alleged hospital staff were not adequately trained and had wrongly removed a knee support pad. United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust denies breaching health and safety regulations. Mr Biggadike was receiving physiotherapy at the hospital ahead of being discharged in April 2012 when the incident happened. More stories from around Lincolnshire The defence suggest Mr Biggadike's death was not caused by failings in training, but by a failure to act after a previous \"serious incident\" with a hoist at a hospital in Leicester in 2007. Jurors heard evidence from Sarah Vincent, representing the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Mrs Vincent admitted the Leicester incident was \"serious\" but conceded the subsequent MHRA investigation was limited to questioning the hoist manufacturer's own investigation and making sure the hospital trust had instructions for using the hoist. United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust denies breach of health and safety regulations by exposing non-employees to risk by failing to train, supervise and monitor its employees in relation to the safe use of the lifting hoist on dates between July 2001 and April 2012.

        "Prof Les Mayhew said the difference between the sexes peaked at nearly six years in the 1970s. Life expectancy is going up all round, but the rates for men are increasing faster. Plummeting smoking rates in men are thought to explain a lot of the change. Prof Mayhew, a professor of statistics at Cass Business School, analysed life expectancy data in England and Wales. He was working out how long 30-year-olds could expect to live. His findings show men languishing far behind for decades, but now starting to get closer to women. If current trends continue, Prof Mayhew predicts, both sexes could, on average, be living to the age of 87 in 2030. He said: \"What's interesting at the moment is that in the last 20 years or so, male life expectancy at 30 has jumped by about six years and if it jumps by the same amount in the next 20 years it will converge with female life expectancy.\" The reason could be down to men living a healthier lifestyle. \"One of the main reasons, I think, is the trend in the prevalence of smoking. Smoking took off after 1920 in the male population and at its high about 80 of males smoked. \"This was reflected in more divergence in the life expectancy, so by the time you get to about 1970 it was at its peak - the difference in life expectancy was about 5.7 years.\" Other factors are thought to be safer, more office-based, jobs. Millions of men used to work in hazardous occupations such as coal mining. Healthcare has meant more men live longer as well. People with heart disease, which is more common in men, can expect to live much longer than they did a few decades ago. By contrast, women started smoking later than men. , but are falling fast in men. A boy and a girl born on the same day will still not have the same life expectancies, as the study looked only at people who had already reached 30. Boys are more likely to die in their first year of life and are more likely to take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents. It means that women could still have the edge for some time to come. Prof David Leon, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"In virtually all countries in the world, women do have a slight advantage.\" However, he said the gap was definitely closing in some countries. Countries with lower levels of life expectancy, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, showed very little difference between the genders. This was due to the prevalence of infectious diseases which \"are not picky about men and women,\" he said. In countries that had defeated most infectious diseases, such as in Eastern Europe, \"there is a much bigger difference, mostly dominated by lifestyle factors.\" At one point in the 1990s, the gap between life expectancies in Russia reached 13 years. Prof Leon said it was an \"absolutely massive\" difference in a \"very gendered society.\" In his third class of countries, such as the UK, the gap in life expectancies is starting to narrow. He said: \"Men are getting a bit better behaved and women are adopting male life expectancies.\"",
        "Many Sephardic Jews were killed, forced to convert to Christianity or leave at the end of the 15th Century. Parliament paved the way for a change in citizenship laws two years ago, but the move needed Cabinet approval. From now on, descendants of Sephardic Jews who can prove a strong link to Portugal can apply for a passport. Proof can be brought, the government says, through a combination of surname, language spoken in the family or evidence of direct descent. Thousands of Sephardic Jews were forced off the Iberian peninsula, first from Spain and then from Portugal. Some of those who fled to other parts of Europe or to America continued to speak a form of Portuguese in their new communities. The Portuguese government acknowledges that Jews lived in the region long before the Portuguese kingdom was founded in the 12th Century. \"There is no possibility to amend what was done,\" says Portuguese Justice Minister Paula Teixera da Cruz, adding that the law change was \"an attribution of a right.\" Portugal's Jewish community which once numbered in the tens of thousands has shrunk to just 1,000 - most of them Ashkenazim with roots in Eastern Europe.

        "The rail operator had warned ongoing negotiations meant that drivers were not volunteering for Sunday shifts. ScotRail said it aimed to run two-thirds of its services and buses would replace trains on some routes. The operator has published an amended timetable listing cancelled services and those with reduced frequency. On Wednesday, ScotRail said it had offered drivers a 2.5 pay rise and a one-off bonus, and would increase driver numbers. But Aslef accused the Abellio-owned operator of trying to push new terms and conditions through. Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary Grahame Smith said: \"It is simply astonishing that significant service reductions are being announced only three months after Abellio assumed control of the ScotRail franchise. \"Their approach to workforce planning and industrial relations appears nothing short of shambolic and contrary to the impression they were anxious to portray during the bid process. \"The Scottish government must now answer serious questions over how service cuts and amateur industrial relations are permissible under the terms of a very detailed franchise agreement.\" A Transport Scotland spokeswoman said: \"Industrial relations are a matter for the employer and the union. \"It is in the best interests of passengers that ScotRail and Aslef come together to resolve this issue as quickly as possible to avoid unnecessary disruption. \"Keeping passengers informed and ensuring they can plan ahead with confidence in advance is a key priority and people should check the updated timetables on the ScotRail website before they start their journey.\" ScotRail have said that although they will be running fewer trains on Sundays, most of the trains that do run will have more carriages.

        "The Tower Blocks - Our Blocks project has been described as a \"Domesday Book\" of the UK's post-war reconstruction. It will include images of towers which have been demolished over the past 30 years, as well as those which are still standing. It has been created by social and architectural historians from Edinburgh College of Art. The project is to receive a PS52,900 grant of Heritage Lottery funding. This money will go towards digitising the 3,500 photographs, as well as supporting local outreach initiatives which the team hope will encourage high-rise residents to tell their stories. Glasgow's Red Road flats and Gorbals housing schemes will be among the multi-storey housing projects on show in the publically accessible digital catalogue. Other well know high rises to feature in the archive include the Everton flats in Liverpool, Birmingham's Chelmsley Wood, Manchester's Hulme redevelopment, and London estates such as Broadwater Farm, Thamesmead and Roehampton. The project is due to be completed by late 2017. Prof Miles Glendinning, head of the Scottish Centre for Conservation Studies at the college of art, said: \"We hope this project will help contribute to the ongoing shift in public attitudes towards the post-war Modernist housing heritage, which is fast turning from an object of dislike and alienation into a force for potential community empowerment. \"Council tower blocks were once the most prominent and dramatic legacy of the post-1945 reconstruction drive, but mass demolitions over the past 35 years, still continuing today, have depleted this vast heritage, leaving it obscured or incomprehensible to the public at a time when popular interest in post-war Modernist heritage is sharply increasing.\" Colin McLean, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Scotland, said: \"Without archives, vast segments of our nation's history would be missing. \"As the high rise towers that have dominated many towns' and city's skylines begin to disappear, it is important for us to capture this heritage and give voice to the experiences of those who live in these flats and communities.\" Glasgow 2014 chiefs faced criticism when they planned to demolish the Red Road flats as part of last summer's Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. They eventually ditched the proposal to blow down five of the six remaining 1960s blocks live on television amid fears of a public protest. Critics said it was insensitive to former residents and to the asylum seekers who still occupied the sixth block. When they were built between 1964 and 1969, the Red Road flats were the highest in Europe at 292ft (89 metres).",

I went out and did pre-season in Madrid for a month and then we flew for the season beginning in October and finished the season off just before Christmas,\" he said. \"We managed to win the league, which was great. \"So it made up for the big decision to go out there in the first place, it kind of justified that by coming back with a winner's medal.\" The Indian Super League has only been around for a few years, with the short season and long distance travel notable elements of the experience for Pearson. \"This will only be the fourth year [of the Indian Super League] coming up now, so it is still in the early stages. It is a good competition, only over a short period of time, so the games are thick and fast with lots of travelling - that is one of the things I found quite difficult, the travelling side of it. \"But I could not speak highly enough of the league. Everybody out there is superb. They try to be as professional as possible. They have got a lot of experience and big names out there and they are trying to build up grass-roots level and start from the bottom.\" Pearson also believes the lure of lucrative contracts in India will encourage other players to try their luck over in the sub-continent.

You're allowed 15 foreign players, and 15 local players. But you can only have five foreign players in the starting team at one time - I think they might be reducing that to encourage the progression of the Indian lads.\" However, Pearson says Indian football still cannot compete with the money being splashed by clubs in China. \"I think the money that is getting thrown around in China is just on another level at the minute,\" he said. \"In India they do try to pay the foreign players well because it is only a short time that they are out there and they want to get the best players to come and help the Indian players develop. \"They are passionate about it and everything they do, they give it their all.\" In terms of his ambitions with Motherwell for the rest of the Premiership season, Pearson added: \"I am just looking forward to helping the team out, contribute as much as I can between now and the end of the season and help this club finish as high up the league as possible.\"",

        "Like a sort of officially sanctioned graffiti, the initials of the housing department of Rio de Janeiro were sprayed on homes marked for demolition. Almost 900 families, many of which lived on Rua da Esperanca (Hope Street), were facing eviction because their houses stood in the way of the planned route for the Transolimpica bus rapid transit system (BRT). The extension of the BRT is part of the upgrades planned ahead of the 2016 Olympic Games, which the city is hosting. The new 25km (15 mile) rapid bus route is expected to carry 70,000 passengers a day. It will link Barra da Tijuca, which will host the athletes' village, to Deodoro, the venue for several Olympic events. Rio City Hall intended to relocate the families from Vila Uniao to small social housing apartments or offer compensation packages. But many residents did not want to leave their 30-year-old community. After two years of uncertainty and a small yet vocal campaign of resistance, they have managed to save it from demolition. Instead of running straight over the neighbourhood, the new 555m-bus system (PS370m) will now cut around Vila Uniao. This means only 191 families will need to be relocated, a 78 reduction in the original number of expected evictions. \"We're celebrating a lot because it was 900 families and now it's 191,\" said Robson da Silva Soares, one of those leading the resistance to the demolition of Vila Uniao. But the victory was bittersweet for the residents, who, in 2012, had been promised investment as part of an initiative to improve the city's poor neighbourhoods by 2020. Months later, the Transolimpica project was announced and along with it, the need to relocate hundreds of families. Many of the homes earmarked for demolition were bigger than the government-funded apartments residents were being offered, explained 68-year-old Francisco Gabriel. \"I've been here 20 years and if it's a choice between leaving for the [government-funded] Colonia Juliano Moreira apartments or staying here, I'd prefer to stay here,\" he said. \"The homes there are smaller.\" According to Rio City Hall, plans for the Transolimpica were redrawn to reduce the impact on Vila Uniao. \"We managed to get public land belonging to the federal government to alter the project and attend to the needs of the residents,\" a spokesman said. Rio City Hall said the project, while causing disruption to some, also had huge potential to improve the lives of locals by linking their neighbourhood to other public transport lines. \"The future corridor will benefit the population leaving a huge legacy of mobility: a fully integrated transport network with the Transoeste and Transcarioca BRTs already opened, and the rail network in Deodoro,\" officials said. But while the reduced number of evictions was welcomed by the majority in Vila Uniao, it did not satisfy everyone, leaving the community divided. Cintia Neves, who runs a lunchtime cafe in the neighbourhood, has lived here almost her whole life. The 26-year-old shares the house her late father built when she was six months old with her mother and brother. \"The vast majority [in the community] think the change is good but there are some who wanted to leave,\" she says, explaining that some homes in Vila Uniao were barely more than hovels. \"We are staying for now\" she said about her family. But even though the relief of those residents whose homes have been saved is palpable the new route is still likely to affect the community. There is the local football pitch, for example. The original plan spared it but the new project runs over it instead. Rio City Hall said it was in talks with the owner of a local football ground to provide a new pitch. There were also concerns that those moving to the new social housing would lose the community feel they enjoyed in Vila Uniao. \"I grew up in the community with my parents and four brothers,\" Mr Soares said. \"There's a market, a bank, a school. But the place where the families are moving to doesn't have any of this. They have to start everything again.\" Mr Soares said he and his fellow campaigners would not give up: \"My house was in the path of the BRT and now I don't have to leave. \"But even so, I will continue with the same fight because independent of me, we're fighting for residents to have their rights.\" And he is confident he can drive down the number of those facing eviction even further. \"We see the possibility of removing fewer still than 191,\" the 37-year-old electromechanical technician said.",
        "The alleged spying by the National Security Agency (NSA) \"must be explained and more importantly new trust must be built up for the future,\" she told German MPs. The allegations dominated the news during an EU summit last month. Ms Merkel said the NSA affair was putting EU-US trade talks to the test. She also said Germany's relations with the US \"are of paramount importance.\" The German government has said it is keen to hear directly from the fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden about the agency's collection of phone and internet data. But Germany says it cannot offer him asylum because he would have to make his application on German soil. According to his leaks, the NSA targeted communications among Washington's Western allies, including Ms Merkel's mobile phone and EU offices. \"The accusations are grave,\" Ms Merkel said in her statement on Monday. She did not comment specifically on the alleged bugging of her phone. The Bundestag - Germany's lower house - is holding a special debate on the NSA spying allegations. The scale of NSA surveillance in Germany is not clear, and last month Germany sent some senior officials to Washington to find out more. German media report that the German secret services exchange intelligence with their US counterparts. But recently the British newspaper the Independent, citing leaks from Mr Snowden, said the UK spy agency GCHQ had tapped into communications using a listening post on the roof of the British embassy in Berlin. Mr Snowden, 30, fled to Russia in June after leaking details of far-reaching US espionage. He has temporary asylum, allowing him to live in Russia, until July 2014.",

        "The leftist Syriza government's surprise decision to call that vote scuppered its bailout talks with eurozone ministers. The Greeks have very little time to prepare for a referendum whose outcome could decide their future in the euro. What is the point of the referendum? The government says the EU-IMF bailout terms are unacceptable, but cannot simply be rejected without the Greek people having their say. The issue is so important for Greece's future that \"we decided to turn to the citizens, to explain our negative attitude to it [the bailout], but to give them the choice,\" Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, in a letter to eurozone leaders leaked by the Financial Times, said holding a referendum \"is a sovereign democratic right of the Greek people, necessary to ensure ownership over the financial assistance programme that will be eventually agreed with the institutions.\" He told the Greek people that the lenders had resorted to \"blackmail\" in order to impose more austerity. After five years of recession and welfare cuts many ordinary Greeks feel bitter that they have suffered while Europe's business elite recovered quickly from the financial crisis. More than democracy is at stake - a vote to reject the bailout could trigger a \"Grexit,\" a Greek exit from the euro. A No vote would formally cut the euro pipeline from lenders, and the Greek government could be forced to issue IOUs or a \"new drachma\" currency to prevent a banking collapse. However, the EU has no mechanism for a country to leave the euro - it has never happened before. What will the question be? The language is quite technical, and many Greeks may struggle to understand it: \"Should the proposed agreement be accepted, which was submitted by the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund in the Eurogroup of 25.06.2015 and consists of two parts, which constitute their unified proposal? \"The first document is entitled'Reforms for the Completion of the Current Program and Beyond' and the second'Preliminary Debt Sustainability Analysis'.\" Beside the question are two boxes: \"Not approvedNo; ApprovedYes.\" Uncertainty still surrounds the referendum. Mr Tsipras's political opponents say he has not told the Greek public exactly what the lenders were proposing, and what in particular he rejected. It is not impossible that Greece's tortuous negotiations with lenders could resume in the coming days. And the current bailout expires on Tuesday - the day that Greece is supposed to pay back EUR1.6bn (PS1.1bn; 1.8bn) to the International Monetary Fund. Greece is teetering on the brink of default, and if that happens events could unfold dramatically before 5 July. Who wants a No vote in the referendum? Syriza, the nationalist Independent Greeks, and far-right Golden Dawn say \"No\" to the bailout terms. Opposition parties object to holding a referendum, and their supporters are likely to vote \"Yes\" or abstain. The main opposition parties are New Democracy (centre-right), To Potami (centrist) and Pasok (centre-left). What was the lenders' reaction? Anger. Eurozone finance ministers had been preparing for last-ditch talks on 27 June to hammer out a deal on reforms. Agreement would mean releasing the final EUR7.2bn bailout instalment that Greece desperately needs. But Mr Tsipras pulled his delegates out of talks the night before and announced the referendum. In an unusual move, the European Commission later published the detailed reforms that it wanted to negotiate with Greece. But the Commission complained that \"neither this latest version of the document, nor an outline of a comprehensive deal could be formally finalised and presented to the Eurogroup due to the unilateral decision of the Greek authorities to abandon the process.\" Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he felt betrayed by Mr Tsipras's move. \"Playing off one democracy against 18 others is not an attitude which is fitting for the great Greek nation,\" he said. IMF chief Christine Lagarde said any referendum would relate to \"proposals and arrangements which are no longer valid.\" Lenders' proposals - key sticking points Source: European Commission document, 26 Jun 15 (pdf) Why couldn't Greece get a bailout extension? There remains a big gap between what the lenders want and the Greek government's agenda. Syriza - a grassroots coalition of leftists - won elections in January promising to end austerity. The price for Greece's massive EUR240bn bailout, which started in 2010, was austerity. The budget cuts demanded by the lenders have thrown many Greeks into hardship and a quarter of the workforce is unemployed. Syriza has urged the lenders to release the last EUR7.2bn of bailout money. But the lenders say Greece must agree to widen the scope of its sales tax (VAT) - to boost revenue - and drastically reduce the numbers entitled to early retirement. The pension system is unsustainable, they argue. Those are the main sticking points, but the lenders also want much more action against corruption and tax evasion. The lenders are not convinced by Syriza's tax income projections. They also suspect that Syriza is unwilling to reform deeply-entrenched working practices.",
        "Saturday's 28-20 loss at Worcester Warriors kept the Falcons pinned to the foot of the table, and was the fourth defeat of the new campaign. London Irish have also yet to record a win, but have better points difference. \"We're a much better side than that, there's far more to come out from us,\" Richards told BBC Newcastle. \"We haven't quite got our attack sorted out yet and our defence is all over the place - if we got one of those sorted out it wouldn't be a problem. \"The defence was woeful in the first half and oddly we won the second half 3-0, but I'm frustrated more than anything.\" Saturday's game was the first in which all of the World Cup duty players had been available, with Argentina centre Juan Pablo Socino restored to the starting line-up. However, not even his introduction helped, as errors continued to plague the Falcons' attempts to end their pointless run. \"At half-time it was about getting it right and understanding where we had gone wrong defensively - which was one-on-one tackles and a few ill-discipline issues, such as lifting the leg in the line-out five metres from their line,\" said Richards. \"Those things made a big difference, and we're doing it week in, week out and it's the same people who are doing it unfortunately.\"",

But the focus has now turned on them following Mr Nesbitt's comments. Mr Nesbitt was asked about the decision of his senior party colleague Danny Kennedy to publicly distance himself from the remarks. He turned to Mr Kennedy, who was sitting behind him on the platform, and said: \"It wasn't disappointing, it was actually quite reaffirming to know Danny was listening.\" The line brought laughter from other candidates and party members. Under questioning from journalists, Mr Nesbitt denied that he had any regrets or that he had made a mistake. \"What I have said consistently is vote Ulster Unionists and then for any candidate that you believe will do the right thing within your community, within your constituency and within the country,\" he said.

I would rather go in with the SDLP.\" Mr Nesbitt went on to say that, on Monday, he spent a lot of time time knocking doors in heavily unionist areas with \"very little criticism and a lot of support for what I was talking about.\" \"I am confident in my position and I'm very confident and relaxed that [candidates] behind me are taking different positions in terms of vote transfer,\" he said. \"But people will come back on 2 March to thinking about the PS85,000 a day that is going up in smoke, the 10 years of the DUP and Sin Fein in that castle and the impossibility, no matter what anybody writes in a platform piece for the newspaper, of leopards changing their spots.\" The manifesto, entitled'Real Partnership', includes calls for action in tackling waiting lists, increasing PSNI numbers to 7,500, prioritising the York Street interchange, standing up for the LGBT community and \"guaranteeing\" that no group is worse off because of Brexit.

Australian police searched overnight for the crocodile and the seized boy. They said that two crocodiles, one measuring 4.3m (14ft) and the other 4.7m (15ft), had been shot and examined in the course of their search. \"We've since had a look at both crocodiles and neither of them had anything in their stomachs,\" Sergeant Stephen Constable said. \"We're going to continue the search today,\" he added.

        "Resuming on 193-7, still needing 65 to make the visitors bat again, Leach (90) and Barnard (42) put on 100 to help Worcestershire post 349. Leach then claimed two wickets to leave the Foxes wobbling on 43-2. But Paul Horton (75) and Mark Cosgrove (58) saw Leicestershire to the close on 172-2, a healthy lead of 230. In company with fellow former Shropshire all-rounder Barnard, Leach fell just 10 runs short of his first century for three years. Despite Leicestershire all-rounder Clint McKay taking a tidy 4-59 from 24.1 overs, it left Worcestershire only 58 in arrears on first innings. Leach then broke through in each of his opening two overs as Angus Robson slashed a delivery to point before first-innings centurion Neil Dexter was brilliantly stumped by Ben Cox.

It is not the quickest and with not much going on for the seam bowlers or the spinners. \"We were up against it after the poor session we had on Monday evening so, to stay in the game, it was imperative that we had a good morning with the bat and got as close as we could to them. \"It is mine and Ed Barnard's natural game to try and get on with it and, in the end, we can be satisfied with finishing 50-odd behind on first innings from the position we got ourselves into.\" Leicestershire all-rounder Clint McKay told BBC Radio Leicester: \"It didn't go probably as well as we hoped this morning but that's cricket and they batted very well and we probably weren't at our best with the ball. The game drifted away from us quite a bit. \"But we bounced back after lunch, got a couple of quick wickets and batted quite nicely in the final session to set ourselves up for going into day four. \"With my four wickets, there were a couple of lucky ones in there but it is a hard slog.

        "He said he still favoured the use of Sterling, but said the independence case needs \"refurbishment.\" The MP believed a better case for the retention of the pound would prevent the independence case being \"gazumped\" by opponents in a future referendum. Had Scotland voted \"Yes,\" the planned independence day would have been 24 March. When asked by BBC Scotland's political correspondent Glenn Campbell about the pro-independence camp's stance on currency, Mr Salmond said: \"I think the argument you have got to put forward is one which can withstand any position adopted by your opponents. \"So, you mustn't allow yourself to be gazumped by your opponents. \"Now, I think sterling is the right currency for Scotland, because of a whole range of reasons that we gave during the campaign.\" The former SNP leader was speaking a matter of weeks after current leader and Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced plans for a fresh campaign for independence. She told her party's spring conference in Glasgow, that she would hear \"concerns\" and \"address questions.\" In September 2014, voters north of the border decided by 55 to 45 to stay part of the United Kingdom. The SNP's new strategy will begin in the summer, after May's Holyrood election and June's EU referendum. Ms Sturgeon said the party was prepared to challenge some of the answers it gave 18 months ago. Reacting to Mr Salmond's comments, Scottish Labour's Iain Gray said: \"As far as I can make out he seems to be arguing again for Sterlingisation, a proposal that would have meant Scotland would have become an independent country and at that very moment given up control over its currency and much of its fiscal policy. \"That didn't make sense in 2014, the majority of the Scottish public didn't think it made sense, and it still doesn't make sense now.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Mr Salmond had \"a bit of a cheek\" in \"acknowledging 18 months after the fact that his currency case was always flawed.\" She said: \"People in Scotland have been well served by the pound as part of the UK, particularly with all the shocks and instability we've seen over the last few years in the world economy. \"If there is a united push from the SNP to get us back to yet another referendum, I'll be standing full square behind the decision that we as a country made to stay part of the UK.\" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said it was time to move on from the whole matter to focus on the \"big challenges.\" He added: \"There's no doubt that currency was one of the weakest arguments during the referendum. But the SNP need to move on - we all need to move on from the last five years. It was dominated by independence. \"If we keep dragging over the coals from yesterday's argument, we'll never sort out the future.\" Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie said it was \"welcome\" and \"probably almost inevitable\" that the SNP would re-evaluate its position on the pound. He went on: \"That idea of a currency union failed to convince us, because Scotland would have been in a situation where it didn't have the freedom to set its own economic policy. There were a great many Yes voters who were not sold on that notion of a currency union. \"It's inevitable that there were many people who might ultimately have been persuaded to vote yes, who voted no, and one of the reasons was the lack of clarity on currency.\"",

        "Heads and teachers have been complaining about deepening problems with funding shortages - with warnings they might have to cut school hours. The ministerial response shows 5 of council schools have budget deficits. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said funding gaps had become a \"national scandal.\" \"Over 1,000 schools are in the red. This should be worrying to every parent,\" said Mr Farron. His party had asked ministers how many schools and academy trusts, which run chains of schools, were in debt. There have been growing warnings from schools about problems with funding. The heads of every state school in West Sussex recently sent a letter to Downing Street, warning that they would have to consider cutting school hours or making teachers redundant if they did not receive emergency funding. They warned that schools faced a \"dire financial position.\" In a debate this week on school funding in West Sussex, MPs backed their concerns. Sir Nicholas Soames, Conservative MP for Mid-Sussex, said funding arrangements were \"unsatisfactory and unfair\" and budget shortages would have a \"damaging effect\" on schools. Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing, said there was \"nothing left in the tank\" for many schools and that head teachers were telling him that school finances were at \"breaking point.\" Head teachers say that budgets have not kept up with rising costs. There are also particular regional shortfalls, with the government postponing plans to introduce a national funding formula aimed at addressing local anomalies in funding levels. Education Minister Nick Gibb's reply to the question on schools in debt showed that in 2014-15 there were 113 academy trusts with a revenue deficit, representing 4 of trusts. There were 944 local authority schools in deficit, representing 5.3 of such schools. The National Association of Head Teachers said problems with school funding were \"very serious.\" A spokesman said a survey showed that two-thirds of schools were \"dipping into reserves to stave off deficits\" - and there were fears that rising costs would make this worse. \"I worry that in order for schools to bring their budgets in line to repay their debt, they will have to look at cutting staff, which makes up for 80 of the school expenditure,\" said Mr Farron. \"There will be less extracurricular activities, IT equipment or even books as cash is funnelled into clearing the debt.\" Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, called on the government to provide \"immediate additional funding.\" \"School budgets are being cut to the bone, and many more could find themselves in debt as the funding crisis worsens. \"We estimate that 92 of schools in England could face real terms budget cuts over the next four years.\" But Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"All academy trusts must balance their budget from each academic financial year to the next. \"We continue to monitor the tiny number of trusts which reported a deficit at the end of the academic year 2014-15.\"",

The top four enter the end-of-season play-off semi-finals, with the top two enjoying home advantage. \"We've managed to steadily climb our way back up the league and we've got ourselves back into the top four,\" said Murray. \"Our target is to get in the top four and then, from our performances, we might get in the top two. \"But we are in a good place and we're starting to play some really good rugby at the right time of the season.\" Glasgow travel to Wales to face a Scarlets side sitting three points behind them in fourth and who will be looking to leapfrog their visitors with a victory. \"We've played them there already this season in Europe and we beat them 9-6, so we'll take a lot of confidence from that,\" said Murray. \"Our target is to win all three of those games and it depends on what happens in other games. \"Other teams in the top four all have hard games, so there could be a lot more ups and downs for all the teams. \"There are four good sides in the top four at the moment and, for us to put ourselves in a position where we win it, we have to be better than them.\" Murray thinks the prospect of a final in Scotland, on Saturday, 28 May, should also provide motivation. \"What a great opportunity to go play at a Pro12 final at Murrayfield, but there's a lot of rugby to be played before then,\" he added.",

        "At times it felt disjointed as the local parties fought over different territory. The DUP emphasised its potential role in a hung parliament, while Sinn Fein portrayed the contest as a battle against austerity; a stepping stone towards next year's Dail and Stormont elections. However it was certainly packed with incident. The local parties complained about being excluded from the UK-wide debates, but threats of legal action came to nothing. The two main unionist parties were accused of playing sectarian politics when they agreed a pact in four seats. Sinn Fein faced the same allegation after distributing a leaflet in North Belfast that equated Catholics with nationalists and Protestants with unionists. The DUP had to defend including a feasibility study for a tunnel to Scotland in its manifesto. Sinn Fein had to explain an apparent promise from one of its candidates to pay off people's credit card debts. SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell kept a low profile during debates and hustings. The former leader Mark Durkan didn't seem to bother defending Dr McDonnell against criticism of his double jobbing in the BBC's final election debate. Mindful of the pact, the Ulster Unionists muted their criticism of the DUP, whilst working to try to make up the ground against the bigger party in a couple of key seats. Other parties such as the TUV and UKIP targeted the Northern Ireland Executive parties' track record at Stormont and the mandatory coalition system that makes it so hard to change the make-up of the devolved government. The Greens emphasised their opposition to any welfare cuts. The DUP endeavoured to keep the focus on the UK-wide position and the need to strengthen the union. But same-sex marriage - now the subject of a referendum in the Republic of Ireland - forced its way on to the agenda. That eventually led to the big political story of the campaign - the resignation of Stormont Health Minister Jim Wells after making controversial comments on homosexuality and child abuse at a Downpatrick hustings. On the lighter side, I haven't covered a campaign before where a candidate (the UUP's Robin Swann) says he was been mistaken for a male stripper while canvassing a house. Nor have we seen a candidate (Sinn Fein's Gerry Kelly) soliciting a Star Wars stormtrooper for support (even though criticism of his party's leaflet led some social media wags to joke about whether it was \"a Protestant stormtrooper or a Catholic stormtrooper. Once the votes are cast and the ballot papers counted, we will know whether the local parties will be in a position to make a difference in a hung parliament. Either way, some difficult negotiations between our representatives and a new Northern Ireland secretary are inevitable, as the unresolved deadlock over welfare reform means the current Stormont budget has a black hole that needs to be filled.",
        "Vicky Cherry, 44, had been missing for 15 months when police found her body wrapped in a duvet and plastic sheeting at a house in Toronto Street, Bolton, in January. Andrew Reade, 43, admitted preventing the lawful burial of a body and perverting the course of justice. He was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court to four years and four months in jail. Miss Cherry's cause of death could not be ascertained because of heavy decomposition but a pathologist concluded she may have died as a result of strangulation, as injuries to her neck were detected. Sentencing Reade, Judge Timothy Clayson said the defendant could not be held responsible for Miss Cherry's death but what followed was \"inexcusable.\" Officers had launched a \"non-body\" murder investigation because Miss Cherry, from Fulwood, Lancashire had not been seen since October 2015. Reade, of Toronto Street, Bolton, told her family they had split up and she had moved to Blackburn. However, police discovered that her unemployment benefits were still being withdrawn in Bolton. When officers arrested Reade on suspicion of murder, he claimed he had panicked upon waking to find his girlfriend dead after they had binged on a cocktail of drugs. The 43-year-old admitted hiding her body and lying to her family and police. He also admitted taking her benefits for several months after her death. In a victim statement to the court, Miss Cherry's daughter said: \"Reade has held her body in a cupboard with things on top of her like she was a piece of rubbish. \"I will never forgive Reade. Reade himself is the only person who truly knows what happened to my mother. We will be forever tormented by this.\" Nick Ross, defending, said his client, a long-standing user of Class A drugs, had exercised \"very poor judgment\" after grief and panic had set in following Miss Cherry's death. \"He wishes he could turn the clock back,\" he said. Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton said: \"Reade's deliberately deceptive and misleading actions seriously obstructed the investigation into how Vicky died and cost us valuable opportunities to investigate.\"",
        "Hannah Miley, Camilla Hattersley, Robbie Renwick, Ross Murdoch, Stephen Milne, Dan Wallace, Duncan Scott and Craig Benson will travel to Brazil. It means that Scottish swimmers make up 31 of the Team GB swim team for Rio. Wallace, a wildcard pick after falling short of the qualifying standard, Murdoch, Scott, Milne and Hattersley will be making their Olympic debuts. But, as expected, there is no place for Michael Jamieson, the 27-year-old who won a silver medal in the 200m breaststroke at the 2012 Olympics in London and had moved back to Edinburgh in a bid to make the team. Renwick and Miley will be competing in their third Olympics. Miley, who competed in Beijing and London, said: \"It's quite hard to put into words what it feels like to be selected for my third Olympics. \"I still love my sport as much as I've always done and to reach my third Olympics just highlights the dedication that me and my family have put into the sport.\" \"It's another fantastic opportunity to put myself out there against the very best in the world - in the biggest event in the world - and hopefully I can come out on top.\" The 26-year-old, from the Garioch club, is hopeful of winning her first Olympic medal. \"I feel a lot more confident, centred and happy this time around,\" said Miley. \"My previous experiences have been great in Beijing and London, but I feel different heading into Rio and I'm confident that will help me to perform. \"I'm more mature and more experienced and I'll approach this one differently to the previous two.\" Murdoch will swim in the 100m breaststroke after failing to qualify for the more favoured 200m event. \"It's bittersweet I didn't qualify in that event I was very close to but I was touched out by my team-mate Craig Benson, who I can say I'm absolutely delighted for,\" said Murdoch. This will be Murdoch's first appearance at an Olympic Games - but after winning bronze in the 100m breaststroke at the recent World Championships in Russia he's aiming high in Rio. \"The time that I swam during the trials would be good enough to qualify for every Olympics final in history,\" he explained. \"As I showed from Kazan all you need is a lane and I was in lane eight and I managed to get myself a bronze medal so at the minute my focus is to get myself through the rounds as easy as possible, get myself into an Olympic final and then anything can happen. \"I'm really, really please to be selected as part of Team GB for this summer. It's a bit of relief for me as I made the consideration time not the outright qualifying time. I was pretty confident I would go, but now I know.\" Renwick will also be eyeing a medal having won gold as part of the 4x200m freestyle relay team at the World Championships. For Stirling University team-mate Benson, it is a second Olympics having been the youngest member of the GB team in 2012.",
        "It was part of Czechoslovakia until the \"velvet divorce\" in January 1993. Having uncoupled itself from its western neighbour, Slovakia at first struggled to prove itself as an independent democracy, but by the time of the twentieth anniversary of the \"velvet divorce\" in January 2013, it had come to be seen as one of Europe's biggest success stories. Slovakia joined the EU in 2004 and the eurozone in 2009. Its forces have taken part in the Nato-led operation in Afghanistan, and in peacekeeping duties in Kosovo. Slovakia has a significant Romany population which suffers disproportionately high levels of poverty and social deprivation. Population 5.5 million Area 49,033 sq km (18,932 sq miles) Major language Slovak Major religion Christianity Life expectancy 72 years (men), 80 years (women) Currency euro President: Andrej Kiska Philanthropist and former businessman Andrej Kiska (pictured right) was elected president in 2014. He won a run-off election against the country's social democratic prime minister, Robert Fico, whose defeat was considered highly significant: if he had become head of state, his party would have controlled the presidency as well as the government. Mr Kiska campaigned on the need to have a healthy balance of power between the president and the cabinet, and called for a strengthening of the independence of the judiciary where the president appoints important personnel. The presidency is largely ceremonial, but the president has the power to pick the prime minister, appoint Constitutional Court judges and veto laws. A parliamentary majority can override vetoes. Prime minister: Robert Fico Robert Fico (above left) was asked to form a new coalition government after his party won the most seats in the parliamentary election in March 2016. He had already served as prime minister since April 2012. A left-wing deputy in the Slovak parliament since 1992, and a former member of the Communist party, he had previously served as deputy chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL). He left the SDL in 1999 to establish Direction (Smer), which later merged with other parties to become Smer-Social Democracy. He first became prime minister in July 2006 and held the post until July 2010. Although Smer-SD won the most seats in the June 2010 election, he was unable to form a government and went into opposition. Smer-SD won a landslide victory in the March 2012 election, becoming the first party since independence to win an outright majority in parliament. With two powerful domestic financial groups now owning, either directly or indirectly, the majority of media outlets, fears of potential political pressure have increased. In particular, \"oligarchisation\" is seen as having a negative impact on domestic investigative journalism. Television and radio remain the most popular media. Some key dates in the history of Slovakia: - Republic of Czechoslovakia includes Czech, Slovak and Ruthenian lands. The \"velvet divorce\" results in two independent countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 2004 - Slovakia joins Nato and European Union. 2009 - Slovakia adopts the euro.",
        "As no single party or bloc commands a majority of the 325 seats in parliament, the contenders have had to forge new partnerships and deals in their efforts to share out the positions of power. This is the main Shia parliamentary bloc. It was formed after the March 2010 elections as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance (INA). The National Alliance decided in October to support Mr Maliki's bid for a second term as premier, but the decision was reportedly not unanimous. STATE OF LAW COALITION: This grouping - which merged with the Iraqi National Alliance to form the National Alliance - is led by outgoing Prime Minister Maliki, who has been seeking a second term in power. The bloc purportedly cut across religious and tribal lines. It included Mr Maliki's Shia Islamist Dawa [Call] Party as well as some Sunni tribal leaders, Shia Kurds, Christians and independents. Mr Maliki said the alliance wanted an Iraq built on nationalist principles. However, many of the minority Sunnis apparently aren't confident that he truly believes they should be given a large share of power. Mr Maliki hoped to capitalise on successes of his first term in office. However, his record on security was undermined by a series of high-profile attacks on government targets in Baghdad before the March elections. IRAQI NATIONAL ALLIANCE (INA): This mainly Shia alliance - which merged with the State of Law Coalition - includes followers of the powerful cleric and one-time militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr. It brings together the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council (IISC), the Basra-based Fadhilah party, a few Sunni leaders, former prime minister Ibrahim Jaafari, and Ahmad Chalabi - the former exile who played a key role before the 2003 US-led invasion. Jaafari was prime minister in the Iraqi Transitional Government between 2005 and 2006 and his reputation was tainted by the fact that militias took over the security services while he was in charge, and by the sectarian war that ensued. A senior leader of the IISC is outgoing Vice-President Adel Abdul-Mahdi. The Kurdish coalition is dominated by the two parties administering Iraq's northern, semi-autonomous Kurdish region. The Kurdistan Democratic Party led by the region's president, Masood Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Iraq's outgoing national president, Jalal Talabani, are both secular in nature and enjoy close ties with the West. The two parties faced a major challenge in Kurdistan's parliamentary vote this year from the Reform (Change) bloc, which won about a quarter of the seats. The Kurds have played king-maker in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and will likely retain enough clout to be part of a ruling alliance with another faction. This alliance won the election by a slim two-seat margin over outgoing Prime Minister Maliki's State of Law, but neither came anywhere near the majority needed to govern. It is led by former prime minister Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia widely supported by Sunnis who view him as a strongman capable of countering Shia power Iran. The alliance includes outgoing Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni Arab, and senior Sunni politician Saleh al-Mutlaq. They ran on a nationalist platform. While all of the major coalitions have adopted a rhetoric of\"national unity,\" al-Iraqiyya, and Saleh al-Mutlaq in particular, have a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of their rivals. This group brings together a range of significant political figures, including Interior Minister Jawad Bolani and a leader of the Sunni anti-al-Qaeda militia in al-Anbar province, Ahmad Abu-Risha. Unity of Iraq has adopted a similar rhetoric to Mr Maliki's State of Law list, probably prompting suggestions that key figures in the list, such as Abu-Risha, appeared to have been seriously considering joining Mr Maliki. Like al-Iraqiyya, the Unity of Iraq list was seriously affected by the ban on candidates with alleged Baathist links. The Iraqi Accord Front, an alliance of parties led by Sunni politicians, participated in the December 2005 elections but has since been weakened by splits and defections. It includes Speaker of the last parliament, Ayad al-Samarrai. It consists of some tribal leaders and the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), which has increased its political visibility over recent years, enhancing its claim to represent Iraqi Sunnis at a national level. Tribal leaders were courted by major parties as it was thought they would play an important role in the election. Some of Iraq's Sunni tribal leaders sprang to prominence when US forces began backing local sheikhs against al-Qaeda in 2006. While the tribal figures are looking to branch out into mainstream politics, they have not formed a united front and have mainly joined forces with existing blocs. Smaller minorities, including Turkmen, Christians, Yazidis, Sabean Mandaeans, Shabak and others, were thought likely to ally with bigger electoral lists in areas where they were not dominant.

        "Jamie Cox was sentenced to 26 weeks for common assault after he attacked Viktoria Gribovskaja at her home in Lambeth, south London last year. The Swindon-based WBO European super-middleweight title holder had denied assault. His sentence was suspended at an appeal at Croydon Magistrates' Court. The 29-year-old boxer, who appeared in court under his real name Jamie Russan was told his conviction still stands, but that his prison sentence will be suspended for 18 months. Recorder Joseph Boothby told him he should treat the suspended sentence as \"a turning point\" and said: \"Change your ways and think before you get angry with a girlfriend, or anyone else for that matter.\" Cox had been sentenced to 26 weeks in prison for the assault and harassment charges, 20 weeks for violence to secure entry and 12 weeks for criminal damage, to run concurrently. He is currently ranked number four in the world and is also a Commonwealth Games light welterweight champion. After the hearing, Cox said: \"I just want to get back to normal and to fight for world titles. I do not really treat today as a success.\"",
        "Board members are believed to have wanted bigger cost cuts and more focus on the investment bank's performance. Chairman John McFarlane said the bank needed to become more efficient: \"What we need is profit improvement. Barclays is not efficient. We are cumbersome.\" In a statement, Barclays said a \"new set of skills\" was required at the top. Mr Jenkins has been Barclays' chief executive since 2012. The bank said a search for his successor was under way. Barclays' chairman John McFarlane has been named executive chairman until a new chief executive is appointed. In a conference call, Mr McFarlane said the board had decided the firm needed to change its strategy in order to boost revenue growth. Barclays needs to be \"leaner and more agile\" to improve the firm's capital performance, he said. Investors welcomed the news of the change, sending shares in Barclays up more than 2 in London. Mr McFarlane applauded Mr Jenkins' role in steering Barclays through the aftermath of the financial crisis, and through the fallout of Barclays' management shakeup three years ago. But he also said: \"There is no question that cultural change was urgently required.\" Mr McFarlane told BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed that Mr Jenkins' skill set had been suitable when he took the top post, but that the firm's needs had changed. When the BBC asked him about future job cuts, he did not rule them out. Nor did he rule out the possibility of branch closures. \"Inevitably, banks are going to have fewer branches than they have now,\" Mr McFarlane said. He also told the BBC that Barclays would not renew its sponsorship of the Premier League when it expires later this year. Make no mistake, Antony Jenkins, the chief executive of Barclays, has been fired after falling out with the board over the size of the investment bank and the pace of cost cutting. Mr Jenkins, who became chief executive in 2012, was told in the last few days that the board no longer had confidence that he was the right man to lead the organisation. Senior sources have told me that Sir Mike Rake, the deputy chairman of Barclays, approached the new chairman, John McFarlane, to say that a number of board members were unhappy with the speed of change at the bank. They wanted cost cutting to go further and more attention paid to the investment bank which is seen as under-performing. It is thought that Sir Mike wants Barclays to retain its global presence as a major investment bank whilst Mr Jenkins felt it should be cut back. It has been made clear to me that Mr Jenkins was seen as having done a good job steadying the bank after the previous chief executive, Bob Diamond, resigned. But it is now time for a new person at the top. Whilst that search continues, Mr McFarlane will become chairman and chief executive, a similar role to the one he held at the insurance giant Aviva. In Barclays' statement, Mr McFarlane said the bank needed to boost returns to shareholders. \"We therefore need to improve revenue, costs and capital performance.\" The board said it recognised the contribution Mr Jenkins had made over the past three years, and was \"extremely grateful to him for bringing the company to a much stronger position.\" But the bank said its non-executive directors had \"concluded that new leadership is required to accelerate the pace of execution going forward.\" Mr Jenkins took over at Barclays in the summer of 2012 following the departure of Bob Diamond, who left in the wake of the Libor scandal. The bank said Mr Jenkins had inherited a situation which \"would have challenged anyone facing the same issues.\" Mr Jenkins said that when he had taken over as group chief executive in 2012 it was a \"particularly difficult time for Barclays.\" \"It is easy to forget just how bad things were three years ago both for our industry and even more so for us. I am very proud of the significant progress we have made since then,\" he said.",
        "The \"Freital Group,\" named after the suspects' hometown near Dresden, consists of seven men and a woman. The German nationals are accused of targeting refugees and left-wing groups in 2015, causing two injuries. The female suspect confessed to carrying out the attacks, while the men refused to speak in court. The alleged members - aged between 19 and 39 - face life imprisonment if found guilty of attempted murder, and up to 10 years if the court rules they were part of a terrorist group. Their names have not been publicly released. \"They wanted to create a climate of fear and repression,\" federal prosecutors said last year as they prepared the case. \"The aim of this group was to carry out bomb attacks on asylum-seeker shelters, as well as on the apartments, offices and vehicles of those with differing political views.\" The group is accused of targeting refugee accommodation in Freital and a left-wing housing project in Dresden with explosive devices in 2015. In one of the assaults, the suspects threw explosives through the windows of a home for refugees, the prosecutors say. The suspects are also alleged to have targeted a left-wing councillor's car in Dresden. The trial is being held amid tight security. In 2016, there were about 3,500 attacks against refugees and asylum seekers across Germany, the AFP news agency reports citing data by the German interior ministry.

        "In the last three weeks, blooms have appeared along the shoreline on Anglesey and there have been some reports of children being stung. The cold spring meant there were few reports of jellyfish before June. Frankie Hobrow from the Anglesey Sea Zoo advised swimmers to \"look but don't touch\" and to treat stings with vinegar. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said jellyfish, including the Lion's Mane variety, have been seen by holidaymakers at Benllech beach, on the Menai Strait. Ms Hobrow said: \"They have increased over the last two or three weeks with the warmer weather. They get carried around on the ocean currents, they can't swim very well so they rely on being carried around, and we do see this every year once it gets warmer. \"The sea temperatures warm up slightly and we get a lot more swarms of jellyfish.\" Ms Hobrow said the Lion's Mane gives a \"nasty sting.\" She said: \"They can grow very, very big - over two metres - but the ones here are fairly small. \"They can be painful but it's generally localised pain - it doesn't usually last very long. You can often help if you apply vinegar - that's great because it's acidic.\" She also said urine could also be used because of its acidity. The MCS's National Jellyfish Survey, which is in its 10th year, said 7,500 jellyfish reports have been made by the public over the last decade. Dr Peter Richardson, the charity's biodiversity programme manager, said: \"The scarcity of jellyfish reports before June was unusual and could well be linked to the exceptionally cold spring. \"However, as our waters warmed, sightings of jellyfish increased, with moon jellyfish reported in large numbers around the UK, reports of compass and blue jellyfish in the south west, and blooms of Lion's Mane jellies around north Wales and north west England.\"",
        "He has written to the parliamentary speaker criticising her for passing it in December without a quorum. Homosexuals were \"abnormal\" or were so for \"mercenary reasons\" and could be \"rescued,\" a local paper quotes his letter as saying. The bill provides for life imprisonment for homosexual acts and also makes it a crime not to report gay people. The promotion of homosexuality - even talking about it without condemning the lifestyle - would also be punishable by a prison term. The BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in the capital, Kampala, says the president is aware that if he signs the bill there will be an international outcry, which could see some countries suspend aid to the country. His spokesman told the AFP news agency that Mr Museveni believes that gay people are sick but this does not mean they should be killed or jailed for life. \"What the president has being saying is that we shall not persecute these homosexuals and lesbians. That is the point,\" said Tamale Mirudi. By Catherine ByaruhangaBBC, Uganda Uganda already has legislation banning gay sex, specifically between men, lesbianism wasn't considered under a provision of the 1950 Penal Code. The new law would add female-to-female sex to banned practices. The Penal Code also never made it an offence for someone to identify himself or herself as a homosexual. It was the act that was illegal. Gay activists have been able to state their sexuality in public and advocate for their rights without being prosecuted. This, legislators felt, endangered Uganda's culture and family structure, centred around marriage between a man and woman. There's been a battle here, well captured in the international media, between gay activists and Evangelical Christians over the rights and wrongs of homosexuality. So what MPs are trying to do is to create the \"idea\" of homosexuality in the law. Once you specify that homosexuality is wrong, you then ban its promotion. If the law is passed, standing up saying \"I am gay\" would become illegal. Citizens would also have to report anyone who they believe is gay to the police. And it would be illegal to provide advisory services to homosexuals. He denied that the president had changed his mind under pressure. \"The president's position has been the same for a long time, nothing has changed,\" he added. Our reporter says Mr Museveni is trying to reach a compromise with MPs, because if he refuses to sign the bill, parliament can still force it through with a two-thirds vote. But in contrast to Nigeria, where earlier this month the president signed a bill banning same-sex marriages, gay groups and shows of same-sex public affection, Mr Museveni is politically strong and so more able to resist pressure from conservative groups, she says. Mr Museveni said the bill was forced through despite his advice to shelve it until the government had studied it in depth, Uganda's private Monitor newspaper reports. \"Even with legislation, they will simply go underground and continue practicing [sic] homosexuality or lesbianism for mercenary reasons,\" he is quoted as saying. The president's eight-page letter to speaker Rebecca Kadaga said they could be \"rescued\" by improving the economy. He also disputed the view that homosexuality could be described as an \"alternative sexual orientation.\" \"You cannot call an abnormality an alternative orientation. It could be that the Western societies, on account of random breeding, have generated many abnormal people,\" he said. He said another reason women became lesbians was because of \"sexual starvation\" when they failed to marry, the Monitor reports. Ugandan gay rights activist Pepe Julian Onziema told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme he had mixed feelings about Mr Museveni's comments. \"Him not assenting to the bill makes us happy but him calling us'abnormal','nothing-doers','sexually starved', that is so derogatory,\" he said. \"It encourages the community to attack people like me.\" There is meant to be a caucus meeting of ruling party MPs later this month to discuss the bill. The government will try to persuade them to reject it, but some have already said they would go against their government's wishes, our correspondent says. Human rights activists say the bill highlights the intolerance and discrimination the gay community faces in Uganda. One gay activist was killed in 2011, although the police denied he was targeted because of his sexuality. The bill has been condemned by world leaders since it was mooted in 2009 - US President Barack Obama called it \"odious.\" The private member's bill originally proposed the death penalty for some offences, such as if a minor was involved or the perpetrator was HIV-positive, but this clause has been dropped. Correction 19 January: An earlier version of this story referred to Pepe Julian Onziema as a woman. The BBC is sorry for any offence caused.",

        "The health board said the man did not access to the woman's medical records. It said the cleaner had got the patient's name from an electronic floor plan at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. The woman visited the accident and emergency department last week for treatment to a hand injury. The next day she was contacted on the social networking site by the man, who said he had been \"checking her out\" while she was being treated in hospital and that he had got her name from the computer. He is also believed to have asked the woman \"how's the hand?.\" The cleaner has been suspended and police are investigating. NHS Lothian conducted its own inquiry and found the cleaner did not manage to access any of the woman's confidential records. The health board's chief operating officer Jackie Sansbury said: \"He had no access to private medical records and information which is protected by a range of complex security systems. \"We understand that this member of contracted staff only gained the patient's name from an electronic screen for staff showing a floor plan in the treatment area of Accident and Emergency Department, in much the same way as a patient's name would be displayed above their bed in a ward area. \"This in no way excuses behaviour of this kind, however, and security messages have been reinforced to our staff and sub-contracted employees to ensure they comply with our data security guidelines. \"Any member of staff who breaks our rules will face investigation under our disciplinary procedures.\" Earlier, Consort, the private company which employs the man, said they were treating the matter very seriously. Lothian and Borders Police said they had received a complaint and were looking into the matter. The woman told The Scotsman newspaper: \"I didn't know who he was, what he was capable of, or whether he also knew my address and telephone number. \"I didn't know if he was just going to turn up at the house. It's just wrong in so many ways. \"I've got two boys at home - one aged two, the other six months - so I was worried for them too.\" Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland that patient confidentiality was of the \"utmost importance.\" She said she could not comment on any individual case, but added: \"Anybody who goes into a hospital as a patient has a right to assume that their data and information will be treated with respect and in the highest confidence. \"I have asked NHS Lothian to ensure that I am made aware of the outcome of their investigation, and any action that requires to be taken as a result of this will be taken.\"",

        "Australia's foreign minister said these were \"not the actions of a friend.\" The UK took similar action in March, after concluding that Israel was responsible for the use of forged UK passports in the plot. The Israeli foreign ministry said Australia's decision was disappointing. Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said it was \"not in line with the importance and the quality of the relationship between our countries.\" At least four forged Australian passports were used in the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai in January. The originals belonged to Australians living in Israel. The Australian government said a police investigation had left it in no doubt that the Israeli authorities were behind \"the abuse and counterfeiting of the passports.\" As a result Foreign Minister Stephen Smith asked Israel to withdraw a diplomat, whom he did not identify \"The decision to ask Israel to remove from Australia one of its officers at the Israeli embassy in Canberra is not something which fills the Australian government with any joy,\" he said. \"On the contrary, the decision was made much more in sorrow than in anger.\" Passports from France, Ireland, Germany and Britain were used in the operation, and in March, the British government expelled an Israeli diplomat from London. The Israeli government has said there is no proof that it was behind the killing, although Dubai officials have said they are 99.9 sure that agents from Mossad were responsible.",

        "Last week, the 31-year-old Brighton midfielder was named in the Wales squad for their upcoming friendlies, over two years after his last call-up. \"Wales manager Chris Coleman said to have a better chance of going in the summer he'd like to see me playing regularly,\" Crofts told BBC Radio Kent. \"I wasn't guaranteed that with Brighton, so it was a tough decision.\" Crofts has featured 18 times for the Seagulls, who are second in the Championship, this season but his last outing came in the defeat by Cardiff on 20 February. The former Norwich man has won 27 caps for Wales, with the last of those coming against Serbia in September 2013. However, he could add to those in the friendlies against Northern Ireland and Ukraine during the international break. \"With the Euros coming up for Wales it was important for me to get some games under my belt before the end of the season,\" he added. \"After speaking to Chris, my place isn't guaranteed even if I play, but it gives me the best opportunity.\" Crofts began his career at Gillingham and has returned to Priestfield Stadium until the end of the campaign, although Brighton have a 28-day recall clause as part of the deal. He scored 19 goals in 191 games in his first stint at the Kent club and he hopes he can help the Gills, who are fourth in League One, win promotion to the Championship. \"This year I have got three massive goals; Brighton to get promoted, Gillingham to get promoted and a place at the Euros,\" he said. \"I am going to work as hard as I can to achieve those things. I'll give it everything I have got.\"",
        "Rosie Ross, 16, was killed by schizophrenic Inderjit Kainth while she sunbathed in Birmingham City Centre in May 2001. Rosie's Helping Hands has raised PS350,000 for young people in and around Aldridge, but her parents say it is time for the charity to wind down. \"We didn't want to keep it going longer than we had Rosie,\" said mother Karen. The last annual Rosie's Walk takes place on Sunday at Aldridge Airfield and Mr and Mrs Ross hope to raise PS15,000. Mrs Ross said: \"Next year it will be 16 years which is the same amount of time that we had Rosie and we didn't want to take the charity past that time. \"Obviously Rosie will always be with us and we will always miss her but we don't always want to be taken back to those very painful and raw times. \"You do learn to live and cope better with that loss.\" The couple will continue to fundraise and help projects until summer 2017. The charity helped to fund a pirate themed play area on the children's ward at Walsall Manor Hospital. Laura Phillimore, healthcare play specialist at the hospital, said the area was a \"grey concrete space\" before its makeover. \"Its made an absolutely huge difference to have a bit of normalising play, making them forget they are in hospital and all the horrible things they have to go through.\"",
        "A spokesman for the Judicial Office said Nick Harrington had resigned with immediate effect. The anti-Irish tweet appeared on the Warwick district councillor's now deleted account during the Eurovision Song Contest but was widely retweeted. Other tweets on the feed which \"may have caused concern\" are also being looked at, Warwickshire Police said. Police confirmed on Sunday they were investigating the tweet, which contained offensive and racist language, and are treating it as a suspected hate crime. More from Coventry and Warwickshire On Monday, a spokesman said officers were aware of other tweets, posted on the same account, which may have caused concern. \"These will be considered during the investigation,\" the spokesman added. The leader of Warwick District Council, Andrew Mobbs, said he was also aware of other comments and it was up to a formal standards committee to purse all avenues before coming to any conclusions. Mr Mobbs had already suspended Mr Harrington, who represents the Stoneleigh and Cubbington ward, from the Conservatives on the district council for six months saying his behaviour was unacceptable. The Judicial Office said magistrates are required by the terms of their declaration and undertaking to inform their bench chairman and justices' clerk if they are subject to an investigation by the police. An advisory committee will then consider whether a conduct investigation is required. The national Conservative Party has suspended Mr Harrington, pending an investigation.

        "These clouds of particles are released in explosive outbursts from the Sun. With the Sun in an active part of its cycle, there are concerns that some storms could disrupt technology on Earth including satellite navigation signals and aircraft communications. The Sun may seem to change little from our viewing position on Earth. With the right equipment, it is possible to see dark regions called sunspots. But up close, our Sun is a dynamic, violent beast. Bright loops of matter arch and twist like fiery fountains above the surface of this gigantic natural nuclear reactor. And every so often an intense burst of radiation called a solar flare appears when magnetic energy - stored in our star's atmosphere - is suddenly released. Solar flares are sometimes associated with the release of high energy particles into space - eruptions that are known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), though these can also occur on their own. A large CME can contain billions of tonnes of gas and other matter that pours into space at several million km per hour. The charged particles in this cloud stream towards any planet or spacecraft in its path. When these particles collide with the Earth, they can cause a geomagnetic storm - a disturbance in the magnetic sheath (or magnetosphere) that surrounds our planet, protecting its denizens from the worst effects of cosmic rays. Many of the effects of charged particles hitting the Earth's magnetosphere are benign, such as polar lights - the Aurora borealis and australis. Geomagnetic storms - often referred to as solar storms - cause these northern or southern lights to become visible at lower latitudes. However, they also disrupt technology on Earth, such as communications systems - including those used by aircraft, satellite navigation signals and electrical power grids. As such, they could wreak long-lasting havoc with communications and power infrastructure across the globe. A 2008 report by the US National Academy of Sciences concluded that an extreme storm could cause up to 2 trillion in initial damages by crippling communications on Earth and causing chaos around the world. As such, several agencies around the world are working to better understand the changing conditions near our planet - known collectively as space weather. Forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center monitor activity using data from a network of sensors, including those on satellites, and US Geological Survey instruments that detect magnetic fields (magnetometers). The Sun goes through cycles of high and low activity that repeat approximately every 11 years. It is currently gaining in activity and is expected to peak in 2013 or 2014, although nobody can be sure. This means we can expect more solar flares and more coronal mass ejections over the next few years. The solar cycle we're currently in has been a relatively quiet one in compared with previous ones. But that does not mean that there could not be a large event in the build up to the next \"solar maximum.\" Yes. In 1994, a solar storm caused major malfunctions to two communications satellites, disrupting television and radio services throughout Canada. In March 1989, another event caused the Hydro-Quebec power grid in Canada to go down for over nine hours. The resulting damages and loss in revenue were estimated to be in the region of hundreds of millions of dollars. But the most significant historic event remains the great solar storm of 1-2 September 1859. This disturbance shorted telegraph wires, starting fires in North America and Europe, and caused bright aurorae to be seen in Cuba and Hawaii. In 1859, our technological infrastructure was in its infancy, but a storm with the magnitude of the so-called Carrington Event would be much more damaging today.",
        "He was speaking in a BBC interview in which he paid tribute to the Queen on the eve of her 90th birthday. She had been a \"guiding example\" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britain's longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an \"important landmark,\" adding the monarch had served the nation with \"dignity.\" In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: \"The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be.\" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as \"work-shy William.\" He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. \"I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a \"work shy\" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised \"but it's not something I take completely to heart.\" An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was \"the best role model I could have in front of me.\" Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday \"does not warrant this kind of coverage\" and that the BBC had a \"duty to report, not to celebrate the royals.\" Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had \"failed completely\" to report the birthday in a way that was \"fair, balanced and proportionate.\"",
        "Rose Morelli, 17, said it was \"hugely distressing\" to see the photo of Alex Elliot on the leaflet by the right-wing Fratelli d'Italia. Gay rights activist group Arcigay alerted her after she posted it online. Fratelli d'Italia tweeted an apology for its \"improper\" use of the photo. Ms Morelli took the photo as part of an art project. She and Alex Elliot chose the image after being moved by the case of US teenager Leelah Alcorn who took her own life in December. Leelah was born a boy but wanted to live her life as a girl. She is now taking legal action after her lawyer said Alex's image had been \"misrepresented\" and may have breached copyright issues. Mr Elliot, 17, said: \"After the tragedy of Leelah Alcorn we wanted to get out the message,'that can't happen again', and that what happened, was in my opinion, so horribly grotesquely moving.\" Ms Morelli said: \"It struck me as hugely ironic at first but after I got over that initial sense of irony, it was hugely distressing. \"The last thing we ever wanted to do was inflict harm on the members of the LGBT community. \"To find out it was being used against them in such a malicious way was horrible.\" Italian law does not currently legislate against crimes motivated by the sexual orientation or gender identity of the victims. On its website, the Trentino branch of the Italian gay rights group, Arcigay, described Fratelli d'Italia's use of Ms Morelli's photo as \"an insult.\" Ms Morelli's Italian lawyer, Alexander Schuster, said he planned to bring a civil action against Fratelli d'Italia and claim for damages. In a message on Twitter, Fratelli d'Italia said the use of the photo had been \"improper.\" It said: \"We did not want to offend the memory of Leelah.\" However, the party maintained that \"it is right to campaign against gender teaching in school.\" Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy) is currently opposing a civil partnership bill being debated by the Italian parliament. It is also known for its anti-immigration stance.",
        "\"I genuinely believe that being on death row for 22 years ultimately saved my life. It was the greatest adventure of my life, and I survived it.\" Nick Yarris has never had an apology for being imprisoned for crimes he did not commit. He spent almost all that time in solitary confinement, sometimes being beaten so badly by prison guards that, on one occasion, his retina detached. \"The hardest thing to do when people are hurting you is to remain a decent person,\" he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. While on death row, he educated himself about the law, and sometimes read up to three books in a day. \"The whole purpose of my education ultimately was so I could deliver a statement eloquently before my execution,\" he said. For 22 of the 23 years he spent in prison, Nick genuinely believed he would be executed. Nick has now written his own book about his life called \"The Fear of 13,\" because he believed bad things happened to him around the 13th date. \"I didn't mind the 23 hours a day solitary confinement for the majority of the time, because after the first few years in prison, when I stopped being angry and started to like myself and understand myself, it was OK. I still enjoy my own company sometimes. \"I've never had any psychiatric help since leaving prison. I studied psychology in there and applied it to myself.\" Nick grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia with his parents and five siblings, but his happy childhood was shattered when, aged seven, he was attacked by a teenage boy who hit him on the head so hard it gave him brain damage and then raped him. He did not tell his parents. The trauma of this assault led his behaviour into a downward spiral and as he got older he began drinking and taking drugs. He was arrested, aged 20, after being accused of the attempted kidnap and murder of a police officer - a charge of which he was later acquitted. But while in custody before that trial, Nick was desperate to get out and so made up a story, telling police he knew who committed the murder of a woman, Linda Mae Craig, who he had only read about in the newspaper and had never met. \"I was just desperate, a drug-addled kid who didn't know what to do to get out of jail.\" He said the murderer was a man with whom he once briefly lived. Nick thought the man - who had stolen money from him - had later died and so believed he could safely trade this false information for his own freedom. However, the man Nick accused was still alive and the lie was exposed. The police then charged Nick with these crimes instead. In 1982, he was convicted of the woman's rape and murder and sent to death row. During his imprisonment in Pennsylvania jails, Nick's only possessions were a couple of paper sacks full of legal materials, some novels, toiletries and a small radio. He was only allowed to exercise for 30 minutes on weekdays in a small cage. He would spend 14 years, from 1989 to 2003, without being touched by another human being. During this time, he would lie on his arm until it went numb and then use it to rub his face, as though it were someone else. In 1988 he became the first man on death row in the United States to ask for DNA testing, but this led to years of heartbreaking delays and churning frustrations, such as when a vital package containing DNA samples burst open when it was posted to a laboratory, destroying the evidence. Eventually, Nick sought the most extreme form of relief from his imprisonment. \"In 2002 I was ready to be executed and I asked to drop my legal appeals so that the execution process would be carried out.\" But then a judge ordered one final round of DNA testing and evidence came back and cleared him in 2003, demonstrating that there were DNA traces of two unknown men in the car and on Linda's clothing. Linda's killer has never been found and Nick received compensation for his wrongful conviction, although it \"feels like pity money\" to him. \"When I got out, I got a mantra from my mother, who sat me down and said that I had to be a polite and kind man from now on and that I had to be kind to women, otherwise it was a waste of coming home. \"She did me a huge favour. I began creating positive passages in my brain that changed my thoughts for the better.\" He also said that when he got out, he noticed how \"people weren't as reserved as they were.\" \"In prison you're not allowed to give out your opinion. But now everyone's expected to give their opinion on social media.\" He now campaigns for the abolishment of the death penalty, has spoken in front of officials at both the United Nations and European Union and has given around 300 talks in schools. And it was a trip to the UK, to speak to MPs in Parliament, that led him to fall in love with England, where he has lived since 2005. \"It felt like a permanent holiday away from my woes,\" he said. Now a father and living in Ilchester, Somerset, he recently saw a photo from his own childhood, showing 27 children from his neighbourhood in the 1970s. He is the only one still alive, the others dying through drugs, car accidents or violence. Both his brothers died because of drugs and alcohol abuse. He added: \"I see my prison past as an old movie I watched that scarred me, but now I don't get so bothered about it. \"If I hadn't have gone to prison, then my life wouldn't be as good as it is now. I never look at it in a negative way.\" The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

        "The 25-year-old American born striker made 37 appearances and scored seven goals during his 12 months at Tynecastle. Johnsen also made his first international appearance for Norway while a Hearts player. The Edinburgh club has strengthened up front, signing Kyle Lafferty during this transfer window. Johnsen was brought to Hearts by former head coach Robbie Neilson after leaving Bulgarian club Litex Lovech. And Neilson's successor, Ian Cathro, had to deny reports of an argument with the striker at half-time during a game against St Johnstone in May.

        "The Easter Road side have lost their last four league games and seen Falkirk open a six-point gap in second place. Boss Alan Stubbs has given his players some rest during the international break to renew their energy and focus. \"The boys are getting time off. The manager said,'you'd better come back refreshed', and it was an order rather than anything else,\" said McGinn. The midfielder joins up with the Scotland squad on Friday ahead of the second of their two friendlies against Denmark on Tuesday, and welcomes the change in scene. He told BBC Scotland: \"It's good to get away. We've played a lot of games, and that isn't a complaint or an excuse, it's just that sometimes it's good to get away from it to recharge the batteries and that's what we'll be doing. \"A big reason for being up near the top of the table was keeping clean sheets and being very astute defensively. Now we're conceding poor goals and not scoring goals at the other end. \"It's a very confusing time for us, but we're determined to work as hard as we can. We're just not getting the breaks or producing the quality we did in the first half of the season and it's something we're trying to eradicate, and hopefully we will before the end of the season.\" Hibs have two games in hand on Falkirk, who lie in the promotion play-off spot, with Rangers a further 11 points clear at the top. But Falkirk could extend their advantage to nine points by beating Livingston on Saturday. \"It's close and that's fair play to Falkirk, and something we're disappointed by,\" McGinn noted. \"We're determined to get that second place and make sure we've got the best chance of going up. \"I'm not playing as well as I was just before Christmas. As a team, we're all not playing as we can and that's evident in the results that are coming for us. We're working hard to try to nail down what the problem is and I'm sure we'll get back to winning ways sometime soon.\" McGinn feels he has developed as a player since his move from St Mirren to Easter Road last summer, and credits Stubbs and the Hibs coaching staff for his improvement. As captain of the Scotland Under-21s, he was one of several young players who impressed Gordon Strachan when he spent time with the squad last November. The 21-year-old aims to use his time training with the squad ahead of the Denmark game at Hampden to show he can make the step up to full international level. \"It's a big step up and I'm really looking forward to showing I'm capable of making that step up,\" he added. \"That's something myself and some of the other new boys will be looking to do. \"The last trip with the 21s that Gordon was there, we knew from the stuff that Ricky [Sbragia] was telling us that he was really keen on how people conducted themselves about the place and in training. \"We knew that if we trained well, we'd have a chance and he'd have a look at us. It's something that I'll be looking to do this time again and hopefully perform as well as I did the last time. \"My first few initial games for Scotland [Under-21s] were difficult. I didn't adapt well, but the more I played the more I got used to the international style. Being the captain of the 21s added a bit of maturity and helped me for the step up.\"",

        "Some applaud Britain's decision as being in its national interest, but others fear that the only beneficiary will be Russia. David Cameron was singled out for criticism, which echoed views heard across Europe that he had put the Conservative Party before the UK in calling the referendum. Estonian Health and Labour Minister Jevgeny Ossinovski wrote in an English-language Facebook post that the UK prime minister had gambled on the European project. Parliament speaker Eiki Nestor also questioned the outgoing prime minister's statesmanship: \"David Cameron never lied to British people when he urged them to vote, but he wasn't a statesman at all when he thought that the election results for the Conservatives are more important than fate of the UK and Europe.\" Latvian former President Vaira Vike-Freiberga tweeted that Mr Cameron would \"go down in history as a less successful British prime minister.\" And Lithuanian conservative politician and former foreign minister Audronius Azubalis saw the referendum and its result as an \"example of political irresponsibility\" \"With all my Britophilia, it is not hard for me to admit that there are more than enough village idiots there as well,\" popular Lithuanian journalist and comedian Algis Ramanauskas said in a Facebook post \"liked\" more than a 1,000 times.

Estonian MEP Martin Helme hailed the Brexit vote on Facebook as a \"joyous day for all friends of freedom and national independence.

No worries, Trump will also get elected,\" he wrote. Estonian political analyst Ahto Lobjakas questioned calls for the European Union to take a hard line in any negotiations with Britain, tweeting \"Why does everyone seem to assume the EU's only option post-Brexit is the honour killing of the UK?\" Pro-Russian activist Aleksandr Gaponenko has seen an opportunity for Latvia to follow suit, announcing a plan to collect signatures for a petition. \"The powers that be will be so scared by the initiative that they will subject the signatories to police repression. The whole of Europe will condemn the repression, and this will be a step towards kicking Latvia out of the new EU,\" he predicted on Facebook. Some commentators, especially in Latvia, see Russia as the Brexit winner. Latvian journalist Aivars Ozolins tweeted that they would be toasting the Brexit vote in the Kremlin with \"copious amounts of vodka,\" while Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics retweeted an LTV News post of his own comment that \"Russia is the winner of Brexit, because the EU will be weakened.\" \"As expected, all the Kremlin internet comment trolls are happy with British democracy,\" conservative former defence minister Rasa Jukneviciene noted wryly. For many observers, there is a widespread feeling that the impact of the British vote should not be exaggerated, and that the focus among remaining EU countries should be on working together. \"Britain's exit from the EU is a real challenge to the community members. We must strengthen EU unity,\" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite posted on Facebook. Lithuanian political observer Vladimiras Laucius said it was \"sad to be left without the British,\" but \"no tragedy, no need to whine.\" Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius tweeted his \"Bregret\" while Latvian Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis vowed that his country would make \"every effort to protect the interests of its nationals and its companies in Great Britain.\" Latvian commentator Kaspars Berzins said the best way to maintain relations was to offer Latvian residence permits and citizenship to anyone with a UK passport on the day of the referendum.

So far 60 nations have ratified the accord, but not the US - the world's top arms exporter. Washington signed the agreement in 2013, but now it requires approval by the Senate, where opposition is believed to be strong. Other major weapons traders - like China, Russia, India and Pakistan - are yet to put their signatures under the deal. In a statement, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the treaty \"marks the opening of a new chapter in our collective efforts to bring responsibility, accountability and transparency to the global arms trade.\" \"Ultimately, it attests to our collective determination to reduce human suffering by preventing the transfer or diversion of weapons to areas afflicted by armed conflict and violence.\" Mr Ban also called on all countries to join the agreement \"without delay.\" Other leading campaigners for a tighter regulation of the arms trade - such Amnesty International and the Control Arms Coalition - urged world governments to strictly adhere to the treaty's principles. The accord has been signed by nearly 130 nations, and five of the world's top 10 arms producers - Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain - have already ratified it.

        "A counter at thepiratebay.se showed a countdown to 1 February, but it appears to have come back online a day early. The website, which provides links to pirated content, was taken offline following a raid in Sweden in December. Police officers seized servers in Stockholm after a complaint was filed by a group called the Rights Alliance, which targets internet crime. The police operation took place in an area in Nacka, south-east of Stockholm, with the area's cold weather used as a natural cooling system for computer servers. The site was taken down in 2006 after another raid by police but reappeared online three days later. The Pirate Bay is one of the internet's most-visited websites, and the film, music and software industries blame it for losses running into billions of pounds. Internet service providers (ISPs) in the UK were ordered by the High Court to block access to the site in 2012. In October Pirate Bay co-founder Gottfrid Warg was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for hacking into computers and illegally downloading files. Another co-founder, 35-year-old Peter Sunde, was arrested in Sweden last year after two years on the run and was sentenced to eight months in prison for violating copyright laws. Meanwhile a third co-founder, Hans Fredrik Lennart Neij (known to hackers as TiAMO), was arrested while trying to cross into Thailand from Laos in November.

        "The University of Essex study of 712 Italian-American mafia members in the 1960s showed their income had risen by 7.5-8.5 per extra year of education. Those involved in complex crimes such as charging exorbitant rates for loans or extortion saw three times the boost of those who committed violent crimes. But, on average, the 712 left education a year earlier than other white men of a similar age in their neighbourhoods. \"Criminal careers are known to start very early and are likely to be interwoven with schooling choices,\" the study says. Lead researcher Prof Giovanni Mastrobuoni said education tended to have a protective effect against getting involved with crime, but he added: \"It is also true that if you decide to be a criminal it's better to be a better-educated one.\" The study says: \"Private returns to education exist not only in legitimate but also in the illegitimate activities that imply a sufficient degree of complexity,\" \"Mobster returns (in terms of income) to a year of schooling are around 7.5 to 8.5, compared to 9-10 for the neighbour sample. \"Moreover, for mobsters who, according to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics records, were involved in white-collar crimes that require running an illegal business (ie racketeering, loan sharking, bootlegging et cetera) we found returns to education that are about three times as large as for those who are involved in violent crimes (ie robberies, murders et cetera).\"",
        "This was a key rebel demand during drawn-out talks which led to a peace deal in August. All foreign forces were meant to have left by 10 October. Meanwhile, a rebel leader has told the BBC the deal is unlikely to work and said he may take up arms again. Tens of thousands of people have died since the civil war began in 2013. Uganda's defence chief Gen Katumba Wamala told the press that all soldiers should be out by 1 November. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Henry Okello Oryem added in a statement that Uganda's intervention \"helped to stop what was likely to be the worst genocide in the region.\" Uganda has not revealed how many troops it has in South Sudan, where they are supporting the government. But they are stationed in three bases: The international airport in Juba; in Nesitu just south of the capital and at their biggest base in the town of Bor, which is hosting some 3,500 soldiers. The BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in Uganda says that a neutral regional force is meant to step in once Uganda withdraws but it is not clear when that will happen. Senior rebel leader Gen Johnson Oloni said he might resume fighting because of President Salva Kiir's recent decree creating 18 new states. He called the plan a \"naked power-grab,\" the BBC's Tim Franks reports from South Sudan. He also said the government was undermining the deal with attacks on civilians. The rebel leader said land appropriations had pushed his ethnic group to use force in the past and they could do so again. Gen Johnson is head of the Shilluk militia, which has been accused by the UN children's agency Unicef of abducting hundreds of boys and forcing them to become child soldiers. The US had proposed that he should be subject to a travel ban and assets freeze, along with an army chief, but this was blocked by Russia and Angola at the UN Security Council. South Sudan's elusive peace: Five obstacles to peace in South Sudan Men of dishonour South Sudan gained independence from neighbouring Sudan four years ago making it the world's youngest country. Two years later, in December 2013, a conflict erupted after President Salva Kiir accused Riek Machar, his sacked deputy, of plotting a coup. Mr Machar denied the allegation, but then formed a rebel army. Much of the fighting has been carried out along ethnic lines, between Mr Machar's Nuer group and Mr Kiir's Dinka, the two dominant ethnic groups in South Sudan.",
        "It found children of minority families do not get enough support to learn Cantonese - putting them behind in school and causing long-term problems in the jobs market. \"One of the main barriers to equal access has been a de facto racial segregation of ethnic minority students from Chinese students in the public school system,\" says University of Hong Kong law professor, Puja Kapai, who carried out the study. The practice of communities studying separately has also meant that children grow up without interacting with other cultures. Hong Kong is home to 365,000 ethnic minority people, making up 6 of its total population. Communities of Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese and Filipinos have lived in Hong Kong for generations. But the city still lacks a curriculum for children speaking Chinese as a second language, which would enable them to learn Cantonese, a requirement for many jobs and university places. \"The language requirement that forms a barrier for ethnic minorities to receive equal access in education and the labour market, can be seen as an indirect form of discrimination,\" says Raymond Ho, a senior member of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong. But he is confident that since the government made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of race in 2009, there is more public awareness of the needs of ethnic minorities. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch In the past there have been claims that Chinese locals are \"less accepting\" of people with darker skin. That was the claim of a report in 2008 from Unison, a group that campaigns for the rights of ethnic minorities. This acceptance level was found to be lowest in the education sector. Language is a major barrier for ethnic minorities to access education. The best place to start learning Chinese and meeting people of other backgrounds is in kindergarten, says Holing Yip from Unison. But Unison's study Kindergarten Support Report 2015 showed that 62 of kindergartens used Cantonese exclusively as the interview language. It also found that privately-run kindergartens were reluctant to give application forms to non-Chinese parents, and many ask children to have Chinese speaking skills by age three. As a result, there is a concentration of ethnic minorities in a small number of kindergartens. Mr Ho says the Equal Opportunities Commission has been \"encouraging kindergartens to be open to ethnic minorities. But also not to use language ability as a selection criteria.\" There has been a pattern of Chinese students enrolling in mainstream primary and secondary schools, where classes are taught in Cantonese. Ethnic minorities would enrol in English-medium \"designated schools.\" But the designated schools equipped students with such a low level of Cantonese that they would find it hard to enter university or employment. As such some parents choose to send their children to Cantonese-medium schools. \"Having struggled themselves, many ethnic minority parents want their children to learn Cantonese so they don't go through what they did,\" says Ms Yip. But getting information about how to apply to Chinese-medium schools is often only available in Chinese. Some have discouraged ethnic minority parents from applying. Those who get places can struggle, as all classes are in Cantonese with no extra support in class and parents are unable to help at home. Many parents are forced to seek extra tuition to help children with homework. \"There are situations where if a tutor can't come one day, their children won't be able to hand in their homework and will be penalised. It's also a huge financial burden,\" says Ms Yip. Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani attended both types of schools. \"I learnt more Chinese in the mainstream school where all my friends were Chinese, just by practising it outside of class, than I did at the designated school where I studied Cantonese as a language class.\" After pressure from local non-governmental organisations and the United Nations, the Hong Kong government disbanded designated schools in 2013. But the tendency to send ethnic minority children to particular schools continues. \"Ultimately, parents are faced with the decision of whether their children should suffer now in a Chinese-medium school, or later in the labour market. And that's not a fair choice for a parent to have to make,\" says Ms Yip. In September 2014, the Hong Kong government took a step forward by introducing a \"learning framework\" aimed at supporting ethnic minority students in learning Cantonese. Depending on the number of ethnic minority students enrolled, schools can receive from HK800,000 (PS68,000) to HK1,500,000 to help them. But Prof Kapai is sceptical about its effectiveness. \"It has simply broken the curriculum down into steps, but nothing has actually changed. There needs to be a Chinese as a second language curriculum to teach non-native speakers how to learn Cantonese properly,\" she says. \"Ethnic minorities may still be struggling with subjects such as maths as a result of the class and material being in Chinese,\" says Unison's Ms Yip Prof Kapai's report emphasises interlinked problems for minority groups. A lack of Cantonese language skills will present barriers in employment, leading to an increase in poverty, and difficulty accessing healthcare. Cantonese language proficiency is a core requirement for some jobs, such as the civil service. Typical occupations taken up by ethnic minorities are in the catering, construction and manual labour industries. The Hong Kong Council of Social Welfare says that many Pakistani, Indonesian and Thai households are below the city's poverty rate. \"I identify as a Hongkonger,\" says Mr Nebhwani. But he is excluded from many jobs because of the limitations of his language skills. \"If I were to try and completely integrate, it would be hard because of my level of Cantonese.\" \"The government is committed to encouraging and supporting non-Chinese speaking students' integration into the community, including facilitating their early adaptation to the school education system and mastery of the Chinese language,\" said a spokesperson for Hong Kong's education bureau.",

        "Pro-Kremlin party A Just Russia put forward both bills, and linked them directly to the situation in Ukraine. Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new \"subject\" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. \"In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,\" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed \"at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the'brown threat',\" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov. Several Russian MPs have also gone to Crimea, including Russian celebrities - former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rodnina, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev.",
        "The response from many in that time has been: \"Let's get on with it.\" That view was shared by the First Minister Carwyn Jones until recently when he altered his opinion and said that we should only start the official Brexit negotiations in the early part of next year. My sense is that the public will be flexible on the timing up to a point, as long as they are given a clear sense of direction. The majority of the political establishment have had to come to terms with the fact that most people ignored their advice to remain. So much for being in touch with the electorate. In conversations with politicians on the remain side since, I have come across a mix of bewilderment, frustration and sadness. And while people like me spend a lot of time talking and writing about a Welsh political dynamic, on this subject at least, Wales was a carbon copy of England. In stark contrast, those that supported leaving feel vindicated by their campaign, and now believe they are the ones in touch with vast swathes of the population. The referendum result was a devastating indictment of the effectiveness of the billions of pounds of EU funds spent trying to regenerate economically deprived communities. The brutal reality is that those who were most likely to vote to leave lived in communities where most EU money had been spent. It is an extraordinary paradox that raised eyebrows far further afield than Wales. The early stages of a debate about replacement funding has got under way. The Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, a Remain campaigner, led the way by wasting no time in calling for a fundamental change in approach. Brexit means the Wales Office may have been given a new sense of purpose, and no more so than in regeneration funding. There's been little meat on the bone but his fundamental premise is that everything has to change, and simply writing a Westminster cheque rather than a Brussels cheque will not cut it. The early signs are that the Wales Office would like to play a part redesigning a new funding system. This will not go down well with the Welsh Government but the come-back from Westminster will be that officials in Cardiff have not done a good job spending the money. There will be something just as fundamental going on regarding financial support for the farming industry. This is a devolved matter so the Welsh Government will have a far stronger sense of entitlement to owning any new system that is introduced. So far there have been plenty of warm words about being in listening mode but not much in terms of concrete proposals, or even ideas, about how to create a new system of agricultural subsidies. And finally, what about the Welsh economy? Those who express concern about the impact of Brexit are criticised by Leave campaigners for creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. When the chairman of the Welsh Conservatives, Jonathan Evans, a fiercely pro-European politician, talked openly to me about recession, there were a number from within his own party who were deeply unhappy at the tone. But how do you then deal with the facts of the matter regarding things like inward investment, when most companies have come to Wales because of our membership of the single market? That was the elephant in the room when the Welsh Government's Economy Secretary Ken Skates spoke about a renewed focus on promoting Wales abroad in light of the Brexit. It is a huge hurdle to overcome, and something that will depend on the effectiveness of the trade deals that Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and Liam Fox will now have to strike with countries around the world. At the same time, there are strong indicators in the Welsh economy, with a continued trend on unemployment in Wales which is remarkable. The norm has been for a number of months that the rate in Wales is lower than the UK average, reversing years of it being the other way round. The underlying strength of the Welsh economy will be tested in the months ahead with the inevitable uncertainty that will accompany the start of negotiations.",
        "But is the issue the result of local factors or a symptom of a more fundamental issue? The number of teacher vacancies in the north east, Highlands and the Northern Isles is relatively high. In many other parts of the country, there is no significant problem filling most teacher vacancies. Council umbrella body Cosla says the problem is in what it calls particular \"pockets\" of the country - rather than a national problem as such. In each of the last four years the Scottish government has increased student teacher numbers. It also argues it has addressed teacher unemployment and stabilised teacher numbers in recent years, and has dismissed any suggestions of a Scotland-wide shortage. There are a number of possible explanations for the problems in northern Scotland. For example, the cost of housing in some parts of the north east - an important factor in the overall cost of living - may deter people from moving there if they know their salary would go further in another part of the country. Young people In rural areas, it can be a challenge to find the right person for any skilled job. Young people from rural areas who want to become teachers will usually have left home at 18 to study - many may simply not fancy returning to a rural community, at least while they are in their 20s or 30s. It is important to distinguish between the drop in the overall number of teachers in Scotland in recent years and the all-too-real challenge some councils face filling advertised vacancies. Councils across Scotland are now committed to trying to maintain teacher numbers - the current council funding deal with the Scottish government makes this a formal obligation. But filling vacancies requires, of course, finding the right candidates. Councils in the north have tried a number of ideas - promoting what they believe to be the advantages of living in their area, for instance, or providing free accommodation. Different challenge One contentious issue is over just who can become a teacher. All teachers in Scotland have to register with the General Teaching Council for Scotland, but teachers from outside Scotland have to meet specific requirements. The biggest number of teachers from outside Scotland come, inevitably, from the rest of the UK. However teachers in England who, in effect, learned on the job as graduate trainees through the UK government's Teach First initiative cannot register in Scotland. Head teacher vacancies throw up a different challenge though. Head teachers are often promoted from within their own council area - they may go for a promoted post at their own school or a nearby school. If these vacancies are unfilled, it may beg questions over why some people appear not to want promoted. One recently claimed to BBC Scotland that the amount of bureaucracy and extra work for a relatively modest rise in salary meant that some may not believe the promotion to be worth it.",

        "\"On an almost daily basis, we are being described the worst threat - be it to Nato as a whole, or to Europe, America or other countries,\" Mr Medvedev said. He cited Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg's speeches and films depicting Russia starting a nuclear war. \"Sometimes I wonder if this is 2016 or 1962,\" Mr Medvedev said. The Cold War was a period of ideological confrontation between the former Soviet Union and Western countries. It began after World War Two and ended with the collapse of the Soviet-led communist camp in the 1989. The 45 years of tension were marked by espionage and proxy wars involving client states - all undertaken with the knowledge or fear of the nuclear catastrophe that actual war would bring. The Nato alliance was established in 1949 to protect Western countries. The six key moments of the Cold War relived How the Cold War ended, in 1989 BBC News - Could you stop World War Three- Russia has recently come under strong criticism over its air strikes in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and over its role in neighbouring Ukraine, which culminated with the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. In an interview with the BBC at the same Munich conference, Mr Stoltenberg said Russia had changed borders by force and had become more assertive - and that Nato had to be able to respond to threats. \"We are not in a cold-war situation, but also not in the partnership that we established at the end of the Cold War,\" Mr Stoltenberg said. Nato, he said, did not want an escalation, but enhanced political dialogue with Russia. Early this month, the BBC broadcast a programme entitled World War Three: Inside the War Room, which imagines a hypothetical Russian attack on its Baltic neighbours - Nato members - and nuclear confrontation.",
        "Dwindling domestic gas and coal supplies mean the nation would become dependent on volatile imports, it adds. The report, by Cambridge Econometrics for RenewableUK, said wind power saved the UK PS579 million in fossil fuel costs in 2013. The UK is recognised for having the best wind resource in Europe. \"One of the main messages from this report is that in a scenario with a higher content of wind energy, you are less reliant on fossil fuels,\" explained co-author Sophie Billington, a researcher from Cambridge Econometrics. \"This is a key message, particularly when you consider that the UK - for the past five years or so - has imported more gas than it has produced domestically.\" She told BBC News that under a high gas scenario (gas power plants replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants) and a 40 increase in gas prices by 30, electricity prices would increase by 8. However, under a high wind scenario (wind farms replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants), electricity prices would still rise but by only 4. \"For the wind scenario, you have higher upfront capital costs but fewer uncertain variable costs, leading to more price resilience,\" Ms Billington added. The report said that the UK electricity sector had undergone a substantial change in recent decades, shifting from a coal-based system to a more balanced mix \"encompassing nuclear and gas-fired power stations, as well as emerging renewable energy technologies.\" It observed: \"Over the next 10 to 20 years, the energy sector will need to be re-shaped again if the UK's targets to reduce CO2 emissions are to be met.\" In 2008, the UK established the world's first legally binding climate change target, requiring governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 from 1990 levels by 2050. Rob Norris, RenewableUK's head of communications, said that currently there were \"not enough renewables in the system to meet those targets.\" He told BBC News: \"The crucial thing is that energy policy is a long-term game and at the moment we only really know what the government support will be out to 2020. \"What you really need is a long-term vision out to 2030 so then you can plan, especially when it comes to things like large offshore developments.\" Mr Norris said he advocated a \"rich energy mix so then you do not put all your eggs in one basket.\" He added: \"If you have different technologies, including renewables, competing against each other then the cost is driven down for the consumer.\"",
        "Haig's side have won the past six European Nations Cup (ENC) titles - the division below the Six Nations - finished third in their 2015 World Cup pool and completed an unbeaten Pacific Islands tour this summer. There is no imminent prospect of a change to the Six Nations format, despite alterations to rugby's international calendar after the 2019 World Cup. But Haig believes the status quo is hampering Georgia's development, and their World Cup preparations. \"Absolutely, we've outgrown the ENC,\" Haig told BBC Scotland. \"You're not being disrespectful to the other teams - you're saying the obvious. \"That's why we've started being public about our desire to get into an expanded Six Nations. Not a promotionrelegation system, that's never been our standpoint, it's always been that the Six Nations gets expanded to seven or eight teams, depending on what the current partners feel is applicable.\" The New Zealander argues: Almost every Tier Two nation agitates for more frequent fixtures against the Six Nations and Rugby Championship heavyweights, but Georgia's case for greater challenges is compelling. The glaring extent of their supremacy in the ENC can be outlined thus: in the last six championships, they've lost just two matches from the 30 played. Their cumulative points difference reads: for 948, against 264. Georgia have lost only once since last year's World Cup - a narrow defeat by Japan - and completed an unbeaten Pacific tour of Tonga, Fiji, and Samoa this summer. Last weekend, they beat the touring Samoans in Tbilisi. A Tier One nation has never played a Test in Georgia, and outside World Cup pool matches, their fixture with Scotland on 26 November will be only the fourth time in 13 years the Lelos have had the opportunity to pit themselves against top-class opposition. \"How can you improve [in that situation]? You can't,\" says Haig. \"The Test schedule for the Tier Ones is already done up to 2019, and the big boys sit around the table and work out a deal. \"Effectively there are a couple of weekends free to be filled with Tier Two teams. Then we go to a meeting, all the Tier Two guys go into a room and everybody scraps over what's left. \"We all have fisticuffs about who's getting what. I'm being facetious to some degree, but that's not too far away from what happens. \"It's not easy - that's the summary of that conversation. It's just not easy for Tier Two teams to get more than one or two Tests every year against Tier One teams. \"I'm not saying World Rugby doesn't look after us, they've been very good to us and helped us develop, but we need more. \"The challenge is that every Tier Two team says they want more, but it's how you prioritise that that's going to be key.\" Alterations to the present Six Nations format have long been mooted - outgoing World Rugby president Bernard Lapasset called for a promotionrelegation play-off, with the ENC winners playing the team that finishes bottom in the Six Nations, as he left office in April. That seems a fair proposal on the face of it, but Haig says Georgia have to be cannier in their demands. \"The reality is, if you were one of those six partners, not one would want to put their seat in jeopardy, and if it was me sitting in their position, I wouldn't either,\" says the New Zealander. \"But if you go to the negotiating table and don't have any cards to play, you've then got to say,'there's no threat here of anybody losing their seat, all we're asking for is you put one more seat at the table'. \"I think for us, that's the smarter way to go. It's also less threatening to the existing partners and it means they're helping to grow the game in eastern Europe. \"There's a massive potential market in eastern Europe, and we would say by including Georgia, or Romania or Russia, you might be able to capitalise on that.\" The prospect of a global season, a closer alignment of the northern and southern hemisphere calendars, has been hotly debated, but Haig fears that scenario would only condense the international windows, and thereby reduce the already scant opportunities for Georgia to take on the \"big boys.\" \"We feel if we can't get World Rugby giving us more Tier One Tests, then the obvious solution would be for us to be included in an expanded Six Nations,\" he says. \"Automatically, you get six more Tier One games. And it wouldn't have to go outside the current Test windows. \"It would fit into both our calendar and the Six Nations calendar. Nothing has to change, apart from the fact we'd get much better rugby. \"And with much better rugby consistently, we'd perform better at a World Cup. That's where we see our future, and that's where we'll keep having those conversations.\" Domestically, there is broad scope for growth. Georgia, says Haig, is a nation where rugby is on a rapid upward trajectory, and sell-out Tbilisi crowds of 50,000-plus for ENC fixtures are the norm. But in his 30-man November squad, over half play their club rugby in France or England, rather than the semi-professional Georgian leagues. Meanwhile, as they seek innovative methods to combat Anglo-French wealth, the Pro12 league's representatives have been exploring opportunities to incorporate North American teams or franchises. The New Zealander says they've made enquiries with the Georgian union too - and those enquiries are most welcome. \"Our union has been approached by the Pro12 - it was just the initial discussions, but we've indicated that absolutely we'd love to have a team in that competition,\" he says. \"We're trying to put our players, whether at international or local level, into better competitions, so that they learn the game and get better. \"It's a pathway for our younger players as well. To have a fully professional team in a competition like that, would do us wonders. \"That's an obvious step that we'd like to continue conversations so that hopefully we can within a couple of years get that up and running.\" The Georgian game has one vital fillip, absent from many of its Tier Two counterparts, that may help smooth its ascent - money. Where the Pacific teams of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga are hampered by modest revenue and ramshackle infrastructure, Georgian rugby is bankrolled by former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili. Forbes Magazine puts Ivanishvili's net worth at 4.8bn (PS3.89bn). That's over 1bn more than US president-elect Donald Trump (3.7bn), and just shy of Richard Branson (4.9bn). In almost five years as head coach, Haig has never actually met the man whose wealth is propelling his vision, but its impact is apparent everywhere. \"When I first came here and saw our high-performance base, not even New Zealand had something like that, and probably still doesn't,\" says Haig. \"We have our own 27-room hotel, swimming pool, commercial kitchen, gymnasium, grandstand, one artificial field, one natural field, fully-lit to international standards. \"It's incredible what we've got here, and we've continued to improve our high-performance centre. \"We've just built a 14x14m fully-covered wrestling dojo that we do a lot of our contact work in. \"Prior to the World Cup, I said, it'd be great if we had this, because it'll help us get better, and bang - it was built in 10 minutes. When you have the ability to do that, it helps everything we're doing. \"He's not at all a rugby fanatic. He's a very private man. He understands what rugby's doing for the country and the people, and that's why he's happy to invest in the infrastructure, and our day-to-day costs are always covered by the government. \"If we've got the opportunity to be sitting at that Six Nations table, it becomes a whole different landscape for Georgian rugby. \"And I'd be pretty confident that whatever was necessary in terms of funding or building more infrastructure, he'd be the first to put his hand up and say, yes, we can do that.\" Haig remains upbeat that as he continues to add tactical nous, game understanding and more polished skill-sets to the historically formidable physical profile of the Georgian squad, and its momentum continues to snowball, there is light at the end of the tunnel. He sees parallels with Argentina, whose case for top-tier rugby eventually grew so irrefutable that they were invited to join the Rugby Championship in 2012 and Super Rugby in 2016, with most of their Test squad contracted to Buenos Aires-based franchise, the Jaguares. And Haig is increasingly reassured by what he perceives to be a change in attitude among the powers-that-be - he says the notion of a bigger Six Nations no longer seems so distant. \"Rugby in Georgia just keeps growing,\" says Haig. \"Player numbers for kids are growing; it's getting bigger and bigger. \"As we build more infrastructure throughout the country, more stadiums, more fields, it's the old adage - if you build it, they will come, and that's been the mantra for us. \"If one of those top nations came to Georgia to play, I can guarantee you we'd be packing out the biggest stadium in Georgia, and it'd be an atmosphere they maybe hadn't experienced for some time. \"I understand that London, Paris, Rome, are all very nice places, but again I think if you are a touring team or tourist coming to play or watch a game in Tbilisi will be an experience you probably haven't had before. \"We're certainly pretty confident within the next four or five years, it's going to happen. \"And the first time it does, it's going to be a big occasion for the country. That's what we keep holding onto - that one day, it's going to happen, and for our country that'll be awesome.\"",

The protestors said the action was part of a general Cymdeithas campaign to put pressure on the Labour administration in Wales to act urgently for the Welsh language. They want the Welsh government to adopt six basic policy changes, including making Welsh-medium education available for all and what they call \"fair funding\" for the language. Robin Farrar, chairman of the society, said: \"We're here to speak out for the present generation, and those to come, who should be able to live in Welsh. \"There's a real crisis facing the language, but the Welsh government is not acting seriously. \"We're certain that our unique national language can thrive over the years to come with positive campaigning and political will.\" A Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We are very disappointed that Cymdeithas yr Iaith has decided to take this course of action, especially as we've held regular, and constructive, dialogue with the group. \"Over the past year we have taken positive action to promote the Welsh language, including significant measures such as publishing proposed standards to improve Welsh language services to citizens.\"",
        "Those words sung by Frank Sinatra for Martin Scorsese's classic 1970s film were ones Rotherham chairman Tony Stewart might have hoped to hear in the town's streets in July 2012 as they moved in to the New York Stadium, its name taken from that of the local area. After four years playing home games outside Rotherham, it marked a return'home' for the Millers. But little could Stewart have realised it would result in such an upturn in fortunes on the pitch too. \"I took over the club six years ago and decided to build a ground that was fit for the purpose, then start working with managers to get confidence back into the town,\" said the owner of Rotherham-based ASD Lighting PLC after the Millers secured Championship promotion by beating Leyton Orient on penalties in the League One play-off final. And as chants of'there's only one Tony Stewart' rang out inside English football's national stadium, neutrals could be forgiven for wondering who the United fans were singing about. Media playback is not supported on this device In a town perhaps more famous for providing the sport with World Cup final referee Howard Webb, than South Yorkshire's second Championship football team, he is the man that saved their club. \"If you're not a Rotherham fan, you can't understand the ups and downs we've had these past few years,\" one supporter told the Football League Show on the steps of Wembley. We can at least try to. 'These vagabond shoes, they are longing to stray'.... a little strong? It is closer to the mark than you would think. In 2008, Stewart bought a club in administration, preparing for a season in the Football League's basement division with a 17-point penalty. That was only the half of it. A factor in the Millers' dire financial situation was the rent being charged at their stadium, Millmoor. The landlords failed to strike a deal with Stewart, and with heavy heart, he laced those vagabond shoes and strayed across the M1 to nearby Sheffield. Rotherham bedded down at the now-demolished Don Valley Stadium, with Stewart promising to fund construction of a new home in the S60 post-code range. A facility built for the hosting of athletics at the 1991 World University Games, Rotherham were welcome tenants for Sheffield City Council, which was struggling to cover the stadium's bills via the rent of Championship rugby league side Sheffield Eagles and the occasional athletics meeting. This lighting salesman from Rotherham could not have fathomed that six years later United would be two divisions higher. Could he? \"My dream is probably to get to the top of the Championship. Talk to Hull, talk to Barnsley, these teams have done it before,\" Stewart told BBC Radio Sheffield two years ago. Three months later they made a brand new start of it. The PS17m New York Stadium was to be Rotherham's new home, a name coined from the fact the area previously housed the site of old steelworks firm Guest and Chrimes, a company famed for manufacturing the Big Apple's iconic red fire hydrants. After four years of League Two - including a play-off final defeat by Dagenham Redbridge - and four managers, Stewart had made good on his pledge as the Millers returned to S60, a stone's throw from Millmoor. As their final season in exile was drawing to a close, then Crawley Town manager Steve Evans was recruited as boss. His arrival, along with the stadium move, sparked Rotherham's remarkable rise. The Glaswegian overhauled a squad Andy Scott had struggled to get the best out of, bringing in 12 and moving out seven players over that summer. And the 51-year-old's first full season started as Stewart had no doubt dreamed. \"Tony Stewart saved Rotherham United. The joyous feelings of Millers fans after back-to-back promotions is in stark contrast to the anger, confusion and despondency felt in the two-year period sparked by dropping out of the second-tier in 2005. \"The club was beset with problems on and off the field. They entered administration in 2006 which caused a 10-point deduction and contributed to relegation the following season. \"Ten more were docked the next year and 17 for Stewart's inaugural season at the helm. They needed someone of his ambition, candour, and business acumen to help them avoid more doom and gloom. \"We can only really guess how much money his Rotherham revolution has cost to date, but the benefit to the club and the town itself is immeasurable. \"Everything Stewart has said he was going to do he has done - the fact it has taken just six years is remarkable. \"The club and the town now have a team and a stadium to be very proud of.\" A 3-0 win over Burton in the new, New York Stadium was witnessed by 11,441 people - a far cry from the 4,484 that attended the curtain-raiser at Don Valley four years earlier. In April, victory over Aldershot Town, ironically under the tutelage of his predecessor, secured Evans' seventh promotion as a manager. \"I walked out on Crawley 12 months ago to come to a club that I believe could be a Championship club,\" Evans proclaimed after finishing, not quite top of the heap, as League Two runners-up. \"We've got a lot of hard work to do to just be a League One club, but we'll get there very quickly under a fantastic chairman and supporters that have been incredible all season.\" More evolution than revolution came in Evans' second close-season as he tweaked his squad for their first third-tier campaign since 2006-07. And as Stewart had hoped, people did want to'be a part of it' in New York. His town's enthusiasm for football did not wane. An average home gate of 8,580 saw United spend the final six months of the campaign in the play-off places, ultimately securing promotion by overcoming Preston North End and then Leyton Orient. \"The fans have been absolutely magnificent. I know how much it hurt them against Dagenham four years ago,\" Evans told BBC Radio Sheffield. \"How could you ever forget what we've achieved in these last two years? If you offered me a lottery win or this, it would be this. Rotherham United's last stint in the second tier of English football came on the back of successive promotions in 2000 and 2001. \"I've been working for a great chairman but they're not always good days. There are days where there's a debate, days that aren't easy ones, but that's why Tony Stewart is as successful as he is. \"He's a man who has everything, so for him to tell me I've given him something money couldn't buy, I'm extremely proud.\" His chairman is not done yet. \"For me, taking over was a challenge and it's a challenge I've enjoyed,\" said Stewart. \"I always say, whatever league you're in, you're in it to win it, to be at the pinnacle of that league. \"There's only one step higher than the Championship - the adventure goes on.\" And PS30m, six years, four managers and two promotions down the road, Stewart still wants to be top of the list, head of the heap, king of the hill.

        "Media playback is not supported on this device Fury upset Klitschko last November to secure the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles but was charged by the UK Anti-Doping Agency (Ukad) in June. A provisional suspension was lifted pending an independent investigation. Fury, who fights Klitschko at the Manchester Arena, has denied any wrongdoing and threatened to sue Ukad. Co-promoter Frank Warren said: \"After all the injuries and contractual problems, there is no danger of the fight not happening.\" I'm just waiting for my revenge. I'm obsessed with the goal of getting the belts back. The road to Fury-Klitschko II has been a rocky one. It was originally scheduled for July before the 28-year-old Englishman turned an ankle in training. In June, the media got wind that Fury and his cousin Hughie, also a heavyweight boxer, had been charged with a doping offence after the banned substance nandrolone was allegedly discovered in their urine samples. However, the samples were taken 19 months ago, nine months before Fury outpointed his Ukrainian rival, 40, in Dusseldorf. Fury claims he was told by Ukad that he would face no action over the test and that a blood test taken at the time, as well as all tests since, revealed no traces. Hughie's case will also be reviewed by the National Anti-Doping Panel. Fury's long-time promoter Mick Hennessy said he was \"very, very confident\" that his fighter would be exonerated after the investigation. Fury did not attend Monday's news conference in London because his car broke down on the way down from his home in Morecambe. But his uncle and trainer Peter Fury said the boxer was \"very upset\" with Ukad and the way he has been treated by the British public. \"There's been chaos around this fight, especially with Ukad slipping statements out to the press,\" said Peter Fury. \"Tyson was found guilty before he was even tried. But I told him that the main thing is he knows what the truth is and that it will come out eventually.\" At a news conference to announce the first fight between the two rivals, Fury turned up as Batman, prompting Klitschko to speculate that perhaps he had dressed as the Invisible Man on Monday. Klitschko, who had threatened to sue Fury's team over alleged contract tampering, also suggested his rival might not even show up on fight night. \"I wouldn't have been surprised if Tyson Fury had turned up and sung a song, so I'm not surprised he hasn't turned up at all,\" said Klitschko, whose defeat by Fury in their first encounter was his first for more than 11 years. \"Even if it doesn't happen in October, I will wait. I've never had such a long break between fights but I've been active, even if I haven't been competing. \"I'm just waiting for my revenge. I just hope he's going to turn up. \"I'm enjoying being the challenger. It has been a great experience for me and it has made me obsessed with the goal of getting the belts back again.\" \"I don't feel my age. I'm still capable of performing as an athlete and I've just gained more experience as a fighter. And I'm not concerned about ring rust, because ring rust is in your head.\" Asked how the rematch would be different, Klitschko said: \"The end of the fight is going to be different. I'm not just obsessed about winning this fight, I'm obsessed about winning impressively.\" Since beating Klitschko, Fury has been stripped of his IBF title for refusing to fight the governing body's mandatory challenger. The IBF belt is now held by Fury's compatriot Anthony Joshua, while American Deontay Wilder is the WBC champion. Media playback is not supported on this device",
        "The 23-year-old Ivorian broke hearts across Great Britain when he snatched victory from Lutalo Muhammad in the last second of the men's -80kg taekwondo Olympic final. It was the Ivory Coast's first Olympic gold and he has, since Rio, become a national hero. He has been gifted a new house and a 50 million CFA franc (PS65,400) cash bonus. Not bad for an athlete who only has access to poor facilities and finds it hard to raise funds to meet his training costs. Cisse insists, however, his celebrity status won't distract him from his taekwondo title defence in Tokyo in 2020. \"People look at me differently now, I've become a national symbol.

He took the opportunity to ask for an improvement in conditions and coaching for athletes. \"We were supported. The Government did what it could.

        "Sylvia Blackburn, 72, suffered serious head injuries outside Bedford Road Lower School, Kempston, last December. Brian Wright, 55, of Kempston, told Luton Crown Court he had been blinded by the setting sun. He accepted he had struck Mrs Blackburn but denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Mrs Blackburn is now being treated in residential care. Judge Michael Kay QC paused the case for five minutes so Mr Wright could compose himself after he told the court how he had turned his victim's \"world upside down.\" Mr Wright said: \"I understand Sylvia was a much-loved lollipop lady, who was loved by the children. \"I am truly sorry for what I have done to her and her family.\" Mr Wright's VW Golf failed to stop for a red light, the jury heard. The married mother-of-three, a lollipop lady for 20 years, had been on duty in Bedford Road as pupils left school. When the traffic lights turned red, Mrs Blackburn, who was wearing appropriate clothing, stepped out to escort a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road. Prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod said traffic in the other direction had stopped, but the defendant did not, and hit her. Mr Wright, of The Dell, said he could not remember if the traffic lights were red or green. \"I was totally blinded by the sun,\" he said. \"I just heard a bump. I was in total shock. \"Since that day I have thought of nothing else other than Sylvia Blackburn and her family and the position I have put them in.\" The court heard the sun was 10 minutes from setting and could have been shining into Mr Wright's eyes.

        "Following the announcement of the new global calendar in March, Premiership Rugby confirmed the 2019-20 domestic season will start in early September and finish at the end of June. Leicester's Tom Youngs had said the proposal \"fills players with dread.\" The RPA has now said a shortened two-month off-season will be \"seriously detrimental to player welfare.\" Premiership Rugby has previously said the 10-month campaign will allow clubs to become \"more sophisticated\" in their management of players, with chief executive Mark McCafferty insisting player welfare remains the priority. But an RPA statement on Monday read: \"The Premiership season is already longer than comparable contact sports, including Super League, NFL and AFL. \"Extending an already arduous season from nine months to 10 has serious implications for players, given the potential increase to the game, training and psychological loads they face. \"The physical and mental strain placed on participants of professional contact sport cannot be underestimated.\" England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland will all be playing international matches in June this summer, while the British and Irish Lions are also touring New Zealand. The RPA has concerns that an extended season could overwork any players involved in future international summer tours - a worry shared by Tigers captain Youngs. \"Perhaps most worryingly is the incredible strain these proposals would place on international players,\" the statement continued. \"If the Premiership season retains its current start date, the addition of a July tour schedule will lead to an 11-month season for these players. \"This cannot be avoided unless these players start their domestic season later, which brings into question the need for the season extension.\"",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device Leigh Griffiths scored a penalty after Patrick Roberts had been fouled by Callum Booth. Griffiths turned provider for Tom Rogic's close-range finish and Roberts netted a stunning third before the break. Callum McGregor scored with a shot off the underside of the bar and Roberts then curled in his second. Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers continued to rotate his squad but no strength was lost as the likes of captain Scott Brown and defender Erik Sviatchenko came in to give others a rest. From the moment referee Andrew Dallas blew his whistle it was Celtic at their scintillating best. The swagger witnessed for most of this season was in evidence from a side that had at least four players who would not be considered first-choice picks. The wide men in particular gave the Partick full-backs a torrid evening with Roberts looking completely unplayable at times. The man on loan from Manchester City floated and jinked past defenders all night. McGregor and Brown provided the drive from the middle of the park - keeping the tempo high and their team-mates hungry. It was quite simply a side with complete belief in their abilities and evidence for anyone who needed it about just how far Celtic are ahead of the rest. The opener came from the spot - Griffiths with his 17th of the season after Roberts was brought down by Booth. The second was a rare scrappy effort from Rogic that bounced off both posts before nestling in the net. Roberts' brilliance was rewarded when he curled in the third before the break. It followed fine build-up play on the edge of the box. McGregor grabbed his fourth in five games as the clock ticked down in the second half. His effort smashed the crossbar and went over the line. The ball bounced out but the assistant referee called it in. Roberts cloned his first and made it five with just minutes left. It was a fitting end to his and Celtic's night. Like so many before them this season, the home side were simply outclassed. They had a couple of chances in the second half but in truth Celtic were toying with them for long spells. In terms of the season, their work was already done and it looked that way. It's 46 games unbeaten in all competitions, 104 league goals and a current total of 103 points. The records just keep tumbling under Rodgers. The big one will be confirmed on Sunday if they can avoid defeat at home to Hearts at Celtic Park and become'the invincibles'. A draw or a win will give them their biggest points tally in a 38-league game season, with the Scottish Cup final against Aberdeen and the chance to complete a domestic treble following on 27 May.

        "Prices rose 0.8 in the month compared with 0.1 in November. Overall in 2015 house prices rose by 4.5, with the average price of a property in the UK now at PS196,999. Separately the Land Registry for England and Wales reported that prices rose by 5.6 in the year to November. It said the average price of a house or flat was PS186,325. Nationwide said the growth in house prices broadly matched growth in average salaries, adding that it expected to see a similar pace of growth next year. Rival lender Halifax calculates that prices are rising twice as fast. Its most recent survey suggested that prices went up by 9 in the year to November. London remained the strongest performing region for the fifth year running, with average prices up 12 compared with a year ago, according to Nationwide. But it did not expect house prices in the capital to continue to see above average growth next year, pointing to the fact that property was becoming unaffordable for many in the city. Average prices in the London are now 50 above their pre-crisis peak in 2007, while in contrast property values in Northern Ireland remain 44 below their pre-crisis peak, despite rising by 6.5 in the last three months of the year. Across the UK as a whole, prices are around 7 higher, Nationwide added. Scotland was the only part of the UK that saw a fall in average house prices, with values down 1.9 in the three months to the end of December compared with the same period a year ago. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, forecast average house prices would accelerate at a modest pace, despite the likelihood of interest rate rises from the middle of next year. \"Further healthy gains in employment and rising wages are likely to bolster buyer sentiment, while borrowing costs are expected to rise only gradually. However, the main concern is that construction activity will lag behind strengthening demand, putting upward pressure on house prices and eventually reducing affordability,\" he added. Overall, Mr Gardner forecast average house price growth of between 3 and 6 nationally in 2016. He also raised concerns about regional variations in house prices, linking strong house price growth in some regions to higher rates of employment growth. \"The gain in employment in London is particularly striking, with the number of people in employment up 14 compared to the pre-crisis period,\" he added. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight forecast house price growth of 6 in 2016 supported by continued buyer interest and shortage of available properties as well as healthy wage growth and levels of employment, relatively high consumer confidence and still very low mortgage interest rates. But he warned that average house prices would \"be constrained by more stretched house prices to earnings ratios, tighter checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders and the probability that interest rates will start rising gradually during 2016.\"",

        "The presidential poll will take place next month and Uhuru Kenyatta is seeking re-election. On Friday, after a case brought by the opposition, the High Court ordered the electoral commission not to print ballot papers. Mr Kenyatta insisted the election would go ahead as planned. \"This kind of intimidation will not be allowed and the election date will not change,\" he said. He said the judiciary could not claim independence and then use it to interfere with the functioning of the executive and other arms of government. The High Court argued that the tendering process for the ballot papers had not been transparent enough. The opposition National Super Alliance (Nasa) alleged that the president had links to Al Ghurair, the Dubai-based firm that won the 24m (PS18m) tender. Al Ghurair and Mr Kenyatta deny any wrongdoing. The judges ruled that the company could still print ballots for the parliamentary and county elections, but the tender for presidential ballots should be re-advertised. Local media have reported that whoever takes on the job of printing and distributing the ballot papers will have just 30 days to do what is usually a 45-day task.

        "The Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) says the audit found no evidence of fraudulent activity, But its chairman said it would take all the steps recommended to put things right. Sports Wales said it would continue funding the association, but it had put special measures in place. The report into the activities of the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) was commissioned by the association, alongside the Welsh government and Sports Wales which oversees and promotes sport and advises the government. The audit was carried out by accountancy firm, KTS Owens Thomas. In their report, which has been published in a redacted form on WABA's website, the auditors said: \"It is our view that in its current state WABA is not fit for purpose and does not qualify to receive public money. \"Sport Wales must consider the implications of this finding. \"We consider that with the implementation of the recommendations set out in this report, WABA will become fit for purpose and qualify to receive public money.\" In 2012, WABA received grant support from Sports Wales of just over PS190,000 - more than double its PS89,000 grant in 2006. The audit report lists a series of financial concerns: The report also raises issues over the way the association has been run since becoming a limited company in 2003. It noted: \"Some members have expressed concern that WABA is not open to constructive challenge and there appears to be divisions in the membership. \"Overall, we have found corporate governance to be poor and dysfunctional. We consider that it is improving, but has not reached an acceptable level.\" The auditors make 38 recommendations for the sporting body's future, including measures to tighten financial controls, banking systems, and expenses management. Their report also calls on the board to \"improve the culture at WABA,\" and to work with Sports Wales to ensure it follows an action plan to implement the recommendations. 'Simply not acceptable' Responding to the report, WABA chairman Terry Smith told BBC Wales: \"Obviously we are very disappointed, but we will take all the steps recommended to put things right as quickly as possible.\" He said much of the organisation was run by unpaid volunteers who did not have formal financial training. But he disputed some of the report's findings, including the issue of unsupported spending. Sports Wales said WABA's failures were \"simply not acceptable.\" Chief executive, Sarah Powell, said an action plan was now in place to resolve the issues at WABA. She added: \"In the best interests of the sport's grass-roots participants and elite competitors, Sport Wales has decided to continue funding WABA, but has put in place special measures to protect public funds, until such time as satisfactory progress has been made on the recommendations.\"",
        "Violence erupted on the outskirts of Jerusalem's Old City and across the occupied West Bank after the end of Muslim Friday prayers. Two Palestinians were reported killed by troops - one an alleged assailant in the West Bank, the other in Gaza. Tension remains despite the end of a stand-off at the holy site. Palestinians returned to the hilltop site known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and Jews as the Temple Mount on Thursday after Islamic authorities lifted a two-week boycott called in protest at new Israeli security measures there. Israel removed all the security apparatus following intense pressure to defuse the crisis after days of deadly clashes. The measures, including metal detectors, security cameras and other infrastructure, were put in place after two Israeli policemen were shot dead by three Israeli Arabs who Israel said had smuggled their weapons into the site. Despite the moves, clashes broke out in and around the compound on Thursday night, leaving 136 Palestinians wounded, Palestinian medics said. There had been fears of further violence as worshippers gathered in East Jerusalem on Friday morning. Israeli police barred Palestinian men under the age of 50 from entering the Old City, site of the holy compound, limiting thousands of Palestinians to pray in the streets outside. The restriction is sometimes used during periods of tension to try to prevent violent protests inside the compound. While most of the crowds dispersed peacefully, brief clashes erupted in the Wadi Joz district, close to the Old City. By evening all restrictions were lifted and Palestinians of all ages were allowed into the mosque compound, Israeli and Palestinian sources said. Violence also broke out in the West Bank cities of Qalqilya, Nablus, Hebron, Tulkarm, Ramallah and the outskirts of Bethlehem. Troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets as hundreds of protesters threw rocks, local media said. Scores of Palestinians were injured, according to Palestinian medical sources. The Israeli military said troops shot dead a Palestinian armed with a knife as he ran towards soldiers at the Gush Etzion junction, a roundabout outside a Jewish settlement bloc, about six miles (10km) south of Bethlehem. However, the Palestinian Maan news agency quoted an unnamed eyewitness as saying the man was unarmed when he was shot from 20 metres (65ft) away. In Gaza, a 16-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli troops amid clashes near the border with Israel, the health ministry run by the enclave's Hamas rulers said. Since the crisis escalated following the killing of the two policemen on 14 July, at least five Palestinians have been killed in clashes and three Israeli civilians stabbed to death by a Palestinian. Differences over the Temple MountHaram al-Sharif go to the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the complex is a flashpoint for violence. Jews revere it as the location of two Biblical Temples and the holiest place in Judaism. It is also the al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam, where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, according to Islamic tradition. Palestinians said Israel's new security measures upset the delicate status quo, which Israel has repeatedly pledged to maintain since occupying the area in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel said Palestinians were using the issue as a pretext to spread hostility against the Jewish state.",

        "A university researcher sent 1,500 identical CVs to German firms - except that some bore the name Meryem Ozturk and others the name Sandra Bauer. In 18.8 of cases Sandra Bauer was invited for interview, whereas the figure for Meryem was just 13.5. When the photo of Meryem showed her in a headscarf only 4.2 invited her. The study was published by the Institute for the Study of Labour, in Bonn. The researcher was Doris Weichselbaumer from the University of Linz, in Austria. The findings are especially significant in light of Germany's current efforts to integrate record numbers of Muslim migrants, many of them refugees from the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. More than a million asylum seekers reached Germany last year, and there has been a backlash from nationalist groups, especially Pegida and Alternative for Germany (AfD). With an estimated three million people of Turkish origin, Germany is home to the largest Turkish diaspora. In her study, Ms Weichselbaumer said that \"a very modern binding of the headscarf was chosen to signal that the applicant was a young, modern woman who could easily fit into a secular environment.\" It is normal in Germany to attach a photo to a job application, she pointed out. The result of the experiment \"implies that the candidate with the headscarf had to send 4.5 times as many applications as an identical applicant with a German name and no headscarf to receive the same number of callbacks for interview,\" she said. Discrimination appeared to intensify when the job required a higher skill level. When Ms Ozturk in a headscarf was applying for a secretarial job she had to send off 3.5 times more applications than Ms Bauer. For the post of chief accountant Ms Ozturk had to make 7.6 times more applications. Ms Weichselbaumer has found similar levels of discrimination in Austria. A female Nigerian job applicant was only half as successful as an Austrian woman in getting invitations to interview, her research showed in 2013.

        "The finding deals a significant blow to the theory of physics known as supersymmetry. Many researchers had hoped the LHC would have confirmed this by now. Supersymmetry, or Susy, has gained popularity as a way to explain some of the inconsistencies in the traditional theory of subatomic physics known as the Standard Model. The new observation, reported at the Hadron Collider Physics conference in Kyoto and outlined in an as-yet unpublished paper, is not consistent with many of the most likely models of Susy. Prof Chris Parkes, who is the spokesperson for the UK participation in the LHCb experiment, told BBC News: \"Supersymmetry may not be dead but these latest results have certainly put it into hospital.\" Supersymmetry theorises the existence of more massive versions of particles that have already been detected. If found, they might help explain the phenomenon known as dark matter. Galaxies appear to rotate faster at their edges than the matter we see can account for, and one set of candidates for this missing dark matter is supersymmetric particles. However, researchers at the LHCb detector have dealt a serious blow to hopes of finding them. They have measured the decay between a particle known as a Bs meson into two particles known as muons. It is the first time that this decay has ever been observed, and the team has calculated that for every billion times that the Bs meson decays it only decays in this way three times. If superparticles were to exist, the decay would happen far more often. This experiment is one of the \"golden\" tests for supersymmetry, and it would appear that this hugely popular theory among physicists has failed. The result is at a statistical level of \"3.5 sigma\" - meaning that there is a one-in-4300 chance that the team would see the same \"bump\" in their data if the decay were not happening. This level makes the find worth further investigation, but falls well short of the 5-sigma level of certainty required for a formal discovery. Prof Val Gibson, leader of the Cambridge University LHCb team, said that the new result was \"putting our supersymmetry theory colleagues in a spin.\" The results are in fact completely in line with what one would expect from the Standard Model. There is already concern that the LHCb's sister detectors might have expected to have detected superparticles by now, yet none has been found so far. If supersymmetry is not an explanation for dark matter, then theorists will have to find alternative ideas to explain those inconsistencies in the Standard Model. So far researchers who are racing to find evidence of so called \"new physics\" have run into a series of dead ends. \"If new physics exists, then it is hiding very well behind the Standard Model,\" commented Cambridge physicist Dr Marc-Olivier Bettler, a member of the analysis team. The result does not rule out the possibility that super particles exist. But according to Prof Parkes, \"they are running out of places to hide.\" Supporters of supersymmetry, however, such as Prof John Ellis of King's College London, said that the observation is \"quite consistent with supersymmetry.\" \"In fact,\" he said, \" (it) was actually expected in (some) supersymmetric models. I certainly won't lose any sleep over the result.\" The Standard Model is the simplest set of ingredients - elementary particles - needed to make up the world we see in the heavens and in the laboratory Quarks combine together to make, for example, the proton and neutron - which make up the nuclei of atoms today - though more exotic combinations were around in the Universe's early days Leptons come in charged and uncharged versions; electrons - the most familiar charged lepton - together with quarks make up all the matter we can see; the uncharged leptons are neutrinos, which rarely interact with matter The \"force carriers\" are particles whose movements are observed as familiar forces such as those behind electricity and light (electromagnetism) and radioactive decay (the weak nuclear force) The Higgs boson came about because although the Standard Model holds together neatly, nothing requires the particles to have mass; for a fuller theory, the Higgs - or something else - must fill in that gap Follow Pallab on Twitter",
        "Sandra Bland was arrested during a heated traffic stop captured on film. She was found dead three days later. The 28-year-old's death and the video footage of her arrest sparked outrage. The arresting officer, Brian Encinia, has been charged with allegedly lying about it, a prosecutor announced after a day of grand jury discussions. Hours later, he was fired from his job. The grand jury had picked out the officer's affidavit as behind their decision, said special prosecutor Shawn McDonald. In that affidavit, Mr Encinia had claimed that Ms Bland was \"combative and uncooperative\" after he pulled her over. The argument began after she was asked to put out her cigarette and he demanded she get out of her car. Video footage showed the police officer drawing his stun gun and threatening Ms Bland with the words: \"I will light you up!\" After the argument moved off-camera, she was heard screaming that he was about to break her wrists and she complained that her head knocked against the ground. Mr McDonald said grand jurors found Mr Encinia's statement that he had \"removed her from her vehicle to further conduct a safer traffic investigation\" to be false. Soon after the indictment, the Texas Department of Public Safety said \"termination proceedings\" would start immediately. Ms Bland's death three days after her arrest was ruled a suicide and the sheriff's officials and jailers were cleared of any crime. But it sparked national headlines for days amid a debate about the police use of force against African Americans. The perjury charge carries a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a 4,000 fine.",

        "In 2014, Sarah Rochira published the results of a major review of the experience of care home residents. The use of antipsychotic drugs was a recurrent theme which she has branded a \"national scandal.\" Health boards and care homes have said changes are being made. The commissioner is asking them to show significant improvements in practice. \"I know professionals don't like this phrase, but across Wales older people in care homes, through the inappropriate use of these drugs, are being'chemically coshed'. That's the reality of it. \"It is a national scandal. I made that clear when I published my review. I was very clear I would come back and look for evidence of changes and I've now begun that process. \"I will publish the findings from the health boards later this year and I cannot be any clearer in my expectation that they understand how inappropriate the current situation is and that they can evidence real progress.\" Antipsychotic drugs are primarily used to treat conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

        "The 23-year-old, Ulster's Player of the Year, made his international debut for Ireland in the Six Nations game against England at Twickenham in February. McCloskey still had a year remaining on his previous contract but had no hesitation in signing a long-term deal. \"I grew up in Ulster and it was always a dream to wear the jersey,\" he said. \"Despite some strong interest from other clubs, it was a fairly straightforward decision since all of my family and friends are here. \"The supporters, the facilities we have and the quality of the coaching were all factors in my decision. \"We had a disappointing finish to the season but I believe things are promising for the future and I'm excited to be part of that.\" McCloskey has accumulated 42 appearances, scoring five tries, since making his debut for the province in February 2014 as a replacement in the Pro12 fixture against the Dragons. Ulster Director of Rugby Les Kiss described McCloskey's expressed delight at McCloskey's decision to extend his stay. \"Stuart has been one of our standout performers all season. A major strength of his is his gain-line busting runs, which we used to great effect this season. \"In addition to his powerful carrying ability, his deft handling and decoy lines have also caused havoc for defences.\"",

        "Neither side had amassed more than 215 in an innings in the previous three Tests and India, who lead 2-0, were struggling on 66-3 and 139-6 in Delhi. But Ajinkya Rahane hit 89 not out in half-century partnerships with Virat Kohli (44) and Ravindra Jadeja (24). Recalled fast bowler Kyle Abbott (3-23) and spinner Dane Piedt (4-101) were the only South African wicket takers. Piedt, 25, playing just his second Test, took four of the first five wickets to fall, including that of Kohli whose fluent 70-run stand with Rahane was ended in bizarre fashion. The India captain, who won the toss for a fourth time, smashed a full-blooded sweep into Temba Bavuma at short-leg and after the ball ballooned into the air, wicketkeeper Dane Vilas dived forward to take the catch. That sparked a mini collapse with three wickets falling for three runs before Rahane, who hit two sixes and nine boundaries in his first half century at home, steadied the innings and took India beyond 200. Rahane was helped by Jadeja, whose 59-ball innings was ended by a smart Dean Elgar catch at midwicket off the bowling of Abbott. South African Abbott, who had earlier bowled Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha, conceded just 23 runs in 17 overs to continue his push to start the four-Test series against England, which begins on 26 December in Durban.",
        "The event was organised by trade unionists, councillors, Labour Party members, and MSPs. They are calling for action by the Scottish and UK governments to protect the industry and its jobs. About 400 marchers set off at 11:00 from the Dalzell works, heading to Ravenscraig for a rally. Up to 270 jobs could be lost after Tata Steel announced plans to mothball the plants along with 900 posts at the firm's facility in Scunthorpe. A total of 225 jobs are threatened at the Dalzell plate-rolling works in Motherwell, along with 45 posts at the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang. The company blames cheap Chinese imports and high energy costs for a collapse in steel prices. The Scottish government has assembled a taskforce to try to guarantee a future for the plants. Community union representative Derek Fearon said: \"We are trying to raise awareness of the campaign, and hopefully through this Tata will become a responsible seller. \"The main aim of the taskforce, the priority of it, is for the two plants to remain open. \"The mood is upbeat, the guys are still positive that everything can be done for the two plants to be saved.\" The Scottish government has pledged to do everything possible to keep the plants operational, with its preferred option being to find a buyer. However, ministers have not ruled out moves to bring both facilities under public ownership. A Scottish Steel Task Force, chaired by business minister Fergus Ewing, and including representatives from trade unions and Tata, as well as local councils, met last week to discuss the way forward. Motherwell and Wishaw MSP John Pentland, himself a former steelworker, has welcomed the creation of the task force and called for all avenues to be explored to keep the plants open. He said: \"The starting point for the Scottish Task Force should be saving the steel plants and all the jobs, not softening the blow. \"We should not meekly accept the annihilation of the Scottish steel industry. We don't want consolation measures such as retraining for other jobs that don't exist. There are other options that will protect the industry and its jobs. \"I believe Scottish steel can have a future, and we must consider all the options to achieve that, including public ownership, which doesn't rely on Westminster anymore.\"",
        "His daughter said he had died at Val de Grace military hospital in Paris on Tuesday evening. Raymond Aubrac and his late wife Lucie became important members of Jean Moulin's underground Resistance movement in 1942. Aubrac was arrested in June 1943 with Moulin, who died after torture. In a recent BBC interview, he described how their arrests by the Gestapo at a doctor's surgery in the suburb of Caluire in Lyon had come as \"a shock but not a surprise.\" Jean Moulin, who had been sent by Gen Charles de Gaulle to organise the underground resistance to Nazi occupation, was tortured, taken to Paris and later died on a train to Berlin. But Raymond Aubrac escaped when a group of fighters including his wife attacked a lorry moving him and other members of the Resistance from jail in Lyon. Born as Raymond Samuel in 1914, Aubrac was Jewish. He studied engineering and married Lucie Bernard after war broke out. After his escape from jail, the couple reached London in February 1944. Their story and their Resistance work with Jean Moulin became legendary in France and the couple gave a number of talks to schools and colleges about their experience. After France was liberated, Aubrac was given the task of supervising reconstruction efforts in the port city of Marseille. From 1964-75 he served as a director at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. He twice gave evidence after the war against Rene Hardy, a fellow Resistance member who was accused of betraying his colleagues but was later acquitted. In 2010, he travelled to London with President Nicolas Sarkozy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Gen de Gaulle's appeal to the French people after the country had fallen to the Nazis. Raymond Aubrac remained politically active until he died and gave his backing to Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande. In tribute, President Sarkozy described him as an \"heroic figure\" whose \"escape, thanks to the courage of his wife Lucie Aubrac, has entered into the legend of Resistance history.\" Centrist presidential candidate Francois Bayrou praised him as a \"major emblematic figure.\"",

As reported on the Ryman Football League website, they were approached by a woman who was late for her wedding. Club secretary Mark Easlea said they wanted to know if she got to the church on time and to congratulate her. More news from Suffolk Despite posing for the photo with the bride-to-be - who appeared to be in decent spirits even though her journey to her wedding had been disrupted - it appeared none of the men had asked her what her name was, where she was from or where she was going, Mr Easlea said. \"Everyone had got out of the coach and was sitting at the side of the road in the blistering heat, when she wandered along and said'Lads, can I have a photo with you on my wedding day?'. \"She was obviously as late as everyone else and we've no idea how long she kept the groom waiting at the altar, but we'd dearly love someone to contact the club and tell us who she is, as we think she brought us luck,\" he said.

        "Allardyce replaced Alan Pardew in December on a two-and-half-year deal with the Eagles one point above the relegation zone. The 62-year-old, who had an ill-fated one-game spell as England boss, led the club to eight wins in 21 games to guide them to a 14th-place finish. \"I have no ambitions to take another job,\" Allardyce said in a statement. \"I want to be able to savour life while I am still relatively young, and when I am still relatively healthy enough to do all the things I want to do, like travel, spend more time with my family and grandchildren without the huge pressure that comes with being a football manager. \"This is the right time for me. I simply want to be able to enjoy all the things you cannot really enjoy with the 247 demands of managing any football club, let alone one in the Premier League.\" Allardyce revealed his decision to chairman Steve Parish at a meeting in London on Tuesday. The Eagles are now looking for their eighth manager in seven years. Although it took Allardyce six games to get his first victory - with BBC Sport asking if the'Big Sam bounce had deserted Palace' - the former Bolton, Blackburn, Newcastle and West Ham boss maintained his record of never being relegated from the Premier League. Only Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Harry Redknapp and David Moyes have managed more games in the Premier League. Allardyce's final game in charge of Palace came on Sunday, a 2-0 loss at Manchester United, having guaranteed safety the previous week by thrashing Hull 4-0. Following defeat at Old Trafford, Allardyce indicated his plans to improve the squad in the summer. He had told BBC Sport: \"We now need to grow, develop and invest. You need to choose the right players and not the wrong ones. Recruitment is the difficult task in the summer.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Allardyce left his post as England manager by mutual agreement in September after only one match in charge. It followed a Daily Telegraph investigation claiming he offered advice on how to \"get around\" rules on player transfers. The FA said Allardyce's conduct \"was inappropriate.\" He apologised, adding \"entrapment had won.\" \"It sounds as if he's going to retire...people might be looking into it and saying'don't worry he'll be back very soon', but from my understanding this is very much a personal decision \"In some ways, this has been a very difficult decision to make but in others it has been a simple one. \"I will always be grateful to Crystal Palace and Steve Parish for giving me the opportunity to go out with my head held high having helped keep the club in the Premier League. \"More than that, they gave me a chance of rebuilding my reputation after what happened with England. I felt I needed another shot at being a Premier League manager and showing that I still had the ability to achieve something significant. As I said last weekend, Palace gave me the chance of rehabilitation. \"That's why it's hard walking away now. I believe the club are heading in the right direction with a hugely supportive board of directors, a great squad of players and some of the most passionate fans I've ever met. \"But there comes a time when you have to take stock of what direction you want your life to take - and that's been the simple part for me. \"I want to be able to savour life while I'm still relatively young and when I'm still relatively healthy, even if I'm beginning to feel all my 62 years. \"While I've got the energy, I want to travel and also spend more time with my family and grandchildren without the huge pressure that comes with being a football manager. I owe that to my wife and family. \"This is the right time for me, I know that in my heart. I have no ambitions to take another job, I simply want to be able to enjoy all the things you cannot really enjoy with the 247 demands of managing any football club, let alone one in the Premier League. \"Steve Parish has been superb during our conversations today. I know it came as a shock to him that I would walk away but our discussions have been incredibly civilised with no recriminations and no fall-out. \"This is not about transfer targets, club finances or anything along those lines. This is me taking the decision I believe is right for my family and myself. \"I would like to thank everybody for their messages of support since the news broke. I've no doubt I will miss management but I certainly have no regrets at this decision.

He reported that seven members of the Afghan security forces has also been killed, as well as a number of insurgents. A combination of Taliban and Islamic State (IS) group fighters - including foreigners - were involved, he said. Both are Sunni Muslim militant groups. The Taliban denied killing civilians, saying that its fighters had killed 28 members of a government-supported militia in the area. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack. \"Criminal terrorists have once again killed civilians, women and children,\" he said in a statement. \"This barbaric act of them is deemed a direct violation of human rights and a war crime.\" Fighting has intensified across Afghanistan in recent months.

        "South Wimbledon and Queensway stations will be the first to see their staff moved from ticket offices into ticket halls and on to platforms. Transport for London (TfL) said it would save PS50m annually as it tries to save PS4.2bn by 2020. But Manuel Cortes, from the TSSA union, said London Mayor Boris Johnson was \"rushing through\" the closures. Mr Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association said: \"Talks on the safety implications of closing over 250 stations have not even been concluded. \"The mayor doesn't seem concerned about how millions of tourists will cope with fewer staff to help them on their way.\" TfL said all stations would remain staffed and 150 new ticket machines would be installed by April 2016. It added that new visitor centres would be created at larger stations such as Victoria and King's Cross to help visitors. Nick Brown, London Underground's chief operating officer, said more staff were being placed \"where they can offer the best possible assistance\" as only 3 of Tube tickets were bought at ticket offices. He said: \"This forms part of our wider vision for the Tube, which includes a 24-hour weekend service on core parts of the network.\" But the changes have led to previous strikes by the Aslef and RMT unions. Labour's London Assembly transport spokeswoman Val Shawcross said: \"When he was elected, Boris Johnson promised Londoners he would protect the capital's ticket offices, but today he starts the process of dismantling each and every one of them. \"Whilst there is obviously a big role for ticket machines to play, there is no substitute for a member of staff.\" London Underground said after 100 meetings with unions the number of roles to be reduced had fallen from 950 to 897 with no member of staff facing compulsory redundancy or losing money.",
        "She will become the new Bishop of Stockport. The Church's ruling body, the general synod, voted to allow women to become bishops in July. The appointment will end centuries of male leadership of the Church and comes 20 years after women became priests. Mrs Lane said: \"It is a remarkable day for me and an historic day for the Church. \"This is unexpected and very exciting. On this historic day as the Church of England announces the first woman nominated to be bishop, I am very conscious of all those who have gone before me, women and men, who for decades have looked forward to this moment. But most of all I am thankful to God.\" While priests are normally in charge of a church, a bishop is in charge of a large area like a county - called a diocese - with hundreds of churches. Some people within the church are against the change because they say tradition dictates that only men should hold the most senior positions. But supporters say there is no reason that women shouldn't be in the Church's positions of power. Churches in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already allow women as bishops, but haven't appointed one yet.",

The pair discussed the possibility, which Marr said would \"make a hell of a lot of people very happy.\" But \"the distrust remained\" between the two and the idea never came to pass. Marr was back in touch with Morrissey in a \"rare period of communication\" when he was remastering The Smiths' back catalogue and they arranged to meet in a pub in south Manchester. \"I was happy to see him,\" he wrote. \"It was 10 years or more since we'd last met. We caught up with personal news and family and reminisced a bit.\" But then the conversation turned to \"deeper things\" and, eventually, what Marr called \"that subject.\" He wrote: \"There had been rumours for years that the Smiths were about to re-form, and they were always untrue. I had never pursued any offer. \"Suddenly we were talking about the possibility of the band re-forming, and in that moment it seemed that with the right intention it could actually be done and might even be great.\" After parting company with a hug, Marr returned to his band at the time, The Cribs, and talked to them about him possibly playing some shows with The Smiths, which he hoped \"might even be better than before.\" But by the time he returned from Mexico with the Cribs, Marr said, the communication had ended. \"Things went back to how they were and how I expect they always will be,\" he said. \"An air of disaffection and distrust remained between us.

The money has never been paid and the council is in the process of trying to get it back. Mr Mackintosh said \"due diligence was carried out\" before the loan was granted. The Conservative MP for Northampton South said he felt \"angry, frustrated and upset\" about the ongoing financial problems at the Cobblers. The club currently faces a winding-up petition from HM Revenue Customs (HMRC) over PS166,000. This is due to be heard on 16 November. The PS10.25m loan was originally given to the club for the re-development of its Sixfields stadium. Mr Mackintosh said all decisions over the loan were taken at the borough council's cabinet and followed \"a lot of work\" by officers. He said safeguards were put in place and were now being deployed by the council to recover the money. Mr Mackintosh said: \"Clearly as leader I have to take some responsibility for what happened. \"It is very frustrating because at the same time there are other things that haven't happened at the club. \"There are serious questions to be answered.\" Club chairman David Cardoza previously told the BBC he expected the loan issue to be resolved by the end of last month.",
        "The Australian, whose car has a major aerodynamic update, was 0.234 seconds quicker than Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. Title rivals Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel were third and sixth, Hamilton 0.7secs quicker than Vettel and 0.372secs behind Ricciardo. Hamilton, who has won five times in 10 years in Hungary, trails Vettel by one point at the mid-point of the season. Hamilton was 0.4secs quicker than team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who was fifth behind the second Red Bull of Max Verstappen, and 0.6secs off Ricciardo, struggling with his set-up. Vettel also appeared to be struggling. The four-time champion was a second off the pace, complained of a lack of rear grip and had a spin and a number of moments when he ran wide and off track. He was not the only one to fall prey to the slippery surface at the Hungaroring. Both Haas drivers crashed at the fast Turn 11, Romain Grosjean incurring only light damage, but reserve driver Antonio Giovinazzi bringing out a red flag when he buried his car in the wall, damaging the left-hand side. And at the end of the session, Renault's Jolyon Palmer lost control at the exit of the fast uphill kink at Turn Four, bouncing over the kerbs and smashing his front wing to pieces. Palmer finished the session in an encouraging 10th, just one place and 0.3secs behind team-mate Nico Hulkenberg on a weekend when he is under pressure. Former F1 driver Robert Kubica will test with Renault at this track next week as the team assess whether the Pole is capable of returning to the sport more than six years after a horrific rally crash left him with only partial use of his right arm. It was not immediately clear whether Palmer had damaged the new floor that was introduced for the first time at the last race and which he was using for the first time. Plus, if he had, whether Renault had sufficient spares to fit a new one. McLaren lived up to their promise to perform better than usual in Hungary because of the relative unimportance of engine power at the track, with Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne best of the rest in seventh and eighth places.",
        "Justin Welby made the announcement after a meeting of primates from the Anglican Communion in Canterbury. In the UK, an act of Parliament passed in 1928 allowed for Easter Sunday to be fixed on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April. However, this has never been activated and Easter has remained variable, determined by the moon's cycle. Easter is the most important Christian festival, as it celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ following his death by crucifixion on Good Friday. The archbishop said he was in talks with Pope Francis, Coptic leader Pope Tawadros, and the leader of the Orthodox church Patriarch Bartholomew. Mr Welby said he hoped the change would happen \"in between five and 10 years time.\" \"I would love to see it before I retired,\" he said, although he warned the first attempt to make such a change was in the 10th Century. An Anglican source told the BBC there had been 15 attempts to agree a common date since then. Easter is on the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon following the spring equinox, meaning it can be celebrated on a Sunday between 22 March and 25 April. But the Orthodox church follows the Julian calendar, hence has later Easter celebrations compared with those of Western Christianity. In 1990, the Vatican approved a proposal for a fixed date, which was subject to agreement with other Christian churches and governments. It has not yet been reached.",

EnQuest said \"additional precautionary steps\" had since been taken. Wood Group said it was committed to employee safety. Mr Innes - who said he has struggled to find more work since raising concerns - said the workers now faced cancer fears, and blood tests were ongoing. He said EnQuest had failed in its duty of care. The men were working at Thistle, 125 miles (201 km) north east of Shetland, doing shutdown work with pipe equipment. Mr Innes claimed they were told there was a problem two thirds of the way through the trip.

He said: \"We had all been working on it without the proper PPE (personal protective equipment), because they had assumed it was clear. \"At first we were all in shock. \"We have been exposed to radioactive material for hours at a time.\" He said they had been told the levels of radiation may not cause them long-term harm, but he was continuing to undergo tests. Mr Innes said of EnQuest: \"They have a duty of care. Their procedures have broken down. \"You can't say'you've been contaminated but we think you'll be OK'. \"I would like somebody to take the case on who's not frightened of the companies.\" An EnQuest spokesperson said: \"EnQuest can confirm that, in December 2016, during planned shutdown activities on its Thistle platform, six personnel employed by Wood Group under a contract with EnQuest were removing a piece of pipework when they were exposed to low levels of NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material). \"The level of exposure was less than 1 of the level at which it is reportable to the Health and Safety Executive however EnQuest advised the HSE of the matter at the time. \"EnQuest has appropriate control measures in place which are designed to prevent exposure to NORM. \"Following an investigation, additional precautionary steps have been taken to further ensure that personnel avoid any such exposure.\" A Wood Group spokeswoman said: \"The health and safety of our people is always our top priority. \"As a precaution following the incident, we downmanned our employees from the platform in order to conduct medical assessments. \"We fully supported EnQuest in a detailed joint investigation and continue to reinforce the application of our health and safety procedures, to ensure the safety of our employees. \"Our commitment and priority following the incident and throughout the investigation has been to the health and wellbeing of our employees.\" John Boland, regional officer for the Unite union, said: \"Unite believes that the way these workers has been treated is terrible. \"It's vital for workers' safety that there is openness and transparency about serious safety incidents, so that we can learn lessons and create a safer working environment for everyone offshore.\" A spokesperson for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said: \"HSE has been made aware of this incident. \"However, it was not reportable under the present RIDDOR system (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations) and no staff raised the issue with HSE separately so no investigation has been carried out.\"",
